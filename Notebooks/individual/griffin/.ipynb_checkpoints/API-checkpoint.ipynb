       "   'review': \"alright... so, i have 400 hours in the game now and i think i can now fairly write about this game. so, siege is in my opinion the best hardcore fps i've played. siege is not casual, there is a lot of fun to be had if you put in the time and because of its so serious nature siege is difficult to get in to. you will get spawnpeeked, you will die instantly, you will feel frustrated maybe even all the time. but when you get a hang of it, when you start learning from your mistakes, when you start learning the patterns in the strats, you will realise how rewarding the game is.\\nyou will need to invest a lot of time, a lot of brain power, a lot of patience, and team work. you cannot survive without team work. even if you frag out and have 15 kills you will still lose the match if you don't have team work. even if you have average raw gun skills, but you have good team work and game iq you will perform much better compared to someone with more gun skills and less game iq and team work.\\nin my opinion the more time you give to siege, the more fun siege will be.\\ngg ez mates :)\",\n",

       "   'review': 'This game used to be good but is taking a large turn for the worst in terms of weapon balancing and operator balance. It started to decline in Operation White Noise with the Global abilities, and now its getting worse with balance updates that make old operators literally redundant and some guns non functional as the recoil is up scaled about 10x its original amount.\\n\\nIn addition, no new maps have really been created over the 5 - 6 year period of the game that actually have any substance as a competitive map. Usually they are all relegated to casual after a season, or you will get a \"remade\" map of an old shitty map instead of actually refreshing content.\\n\\nOverall there have been SOME small changes to gameplay for the better, however overall they have taken to long to come to fruition and the game is still filled with these minor problems as well as major ones (cheaters) that are still currently unresolved in its 6 year lifetime so far.\\n\\nI would only seriously buy this game if you want to gamble that Ubisoft devs care about the actual gameplay and the community rather than the ingame monitization though skins and cosmetics.\\n\\nUPDATE***\\nThe Y6S2 Dev Team AMA has not really addressed any of the core issues besides another mention of combating cheating, and a rework (again for about the 3rd time) to the MMR and ranked match making system.\\n\\nOther than that they are STILL dedicated to re-working maps that are currently in the game, supposedly for the better but I am very doubtful of this. And I did not notice any mentions of new competitive maps being added. If they did mention it it was very brief.',\n",

       "   'review': 'I have played this game for 3 years on PC and xbox, and it was an entire waste of time. The Ubisoft team does everything but actually attempt to fix their games. They do the bare minimum and continue to make politically pleasing changes over actually fixing the dog sh** game. It use to be fun, but Ubisoft does well what it does with its other games, find cosmetic selling points and run the game into the ground. I would gladly bit**slap one of the horrid developers if I could be so blessed to do so! Hope this helps someone before even wasting the $8.00 that its not worth:)',\n",

       "   'review': 'This game is probably one of my favourite games of all time( my most played game by a long shot.) and it will always be my favourite, as it is extremely competitive and rewarding game. But I believe that the game and its developers are not worthy of your money. For a five year old game there are way too many bugs, glitches and issues that have been here since the start that everyone buying the game should know about, as in many respects the game lags behind others in the genre.\\n\\nThe game is extremely low quality in just about every way possible, they use the worst version of battle eye (because ubisoft doesn\\'t want to pay the money for it), this means cheaters plague the game ( I have lost over 500 elo from cheaters on the official rainbow six lfg server)  the the servers are terrible and are no more than 30 tick, the UI is awful and as someone who played from year one, five years later you can\\'t always join your friends lobby.\\n\\nThe ranking system is terrible and hasn\\'t been fixed since the day it came out. It has absolutely no compensation for missing team mates, nothing for how well you performed, nothing for how much you benefited the team. Ranked is plagued by smurfs, and boosters as well as people who drop ranks for easier games and a better k/d. (one a side note, what drove me to write this review was I lagged out of a game, which we queued into before a planned maintenance, upon reloading the game it would not allow me to rejoin the game and gave me a 24 hour ban when the game was over.)\\n\\nThe community is extremely toxic and players will throw at the slightest annoyance. team killing often occurs even in ranked. \\n\\nThere is no progression other than your level which gives you nothing but a number.\\n\\nthere is still no shooting range and the training grounds are laughable at best. \\n\\nThere are a lot of visual glitches such as barricades being destroyed for some people and not others as well as many more (it seems that every day i find a jager himself video with a new glitch.) the audio as been an issue ( sounds muffled, sounds reversed) since day one and sound is such a vital part of the game.\\n\\nThis game was and still is marketed as a milsim, when buying the game do not expect it to be as such, there are now albino people who can make holograms of themselves as well as a rather anime type storyline and cannon which has been desperately stuck on in a cheap attempt to revive the lifeless husk of a \"campaign\" that is in the game in the form of situations (basically a glorified terrorist hunt.) \\n\\nThere a little to no new updates to the game outside the game and any fun events is just an attempt to get people to spend more money on cosmetics entirely locked behind an expensive pay wall, They bring back none of the events which would be an easy way to make the game more fun. They recently brought back event skins form the outbreak events which is just lazy and uninspired and again trying to get you to spend even more money and to revive the decreasing player numbers.\\n\\ncasual or as how they more accurately named it \"quick match\" is not casual in any way and you play against people of our own rank. ranked and unranked are always sweaty as expected. There are no casual game modes in this game and I would recommend anyone looking to play a casual game should get as far away from siege and its toxic community.\\n\\nContent creators are quickly switching games, as siege is becoming more and more dry, the game is very hard to find funny as it takes itself too seriously.\\n\\nSiege is 100% a dying game an its death is imminent, it is very sad to see a game I and many others love so much be on its way out but if the developers do nothing it will be a dead game.',\n",
