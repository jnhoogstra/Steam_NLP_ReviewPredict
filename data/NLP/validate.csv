"Aside from the stupid marketing decision of making Titans a separate game, Planetary Annihilation is a fantastic and unique RTS which allows players to create vast armies of land, sea, air, and orbital units. 

The Titans add a great twist to the game. My favorite Titan is the Ragnarok which drills a hole to the center of the planet and drops a bomb down there, exploding the entire planet. There are ground combat Titans like the Atlas, which smashes the ground to create seismic mayhem, the Zeus which rains down electricity upon units, and the Ares which is a highly durable super tank with massive range.

There are other Titans like the Ragnarok (mentioned above), the Halley thruster which (if enough are built) can cause an asteroid or moon to smash into a planet and the orbital Titan, the Helios which fires lasers at everything and can teleport units right into the enemy's stronghold.

Aside from the Titans, playing with the default units can be fun. It's always nice to see two massive armies of bots, vehicles, and air units clash with perhaps some support from orbital battleships. 

My advice, don't use Tier 1 units. Tier 1 units die too easily and are only useful for very early game. Tier 2 units are where it's at since they have enhanced durability and firepower.

Overall, I rate this game 8.8/10, whatever that means (I literally just came up with a random number I thought sounded good). Whatever you do, DO NOT BUY THE CLASSIC VERSION. They did a really stupid thing by making Titans and Classic two separate things. This game is great and provides hours of planetary annihilation, certainly worth the purchase, especially if it's on sale.",True

i played the original one back in 2016 and tried the definitive edition now. good to see they added the DLCs in a obtainble manner instead of giving them to the player from the get go. the asian aestehtics still remain gorgeous to this date. i liked the storyline since the first time i played it. even the side missions are interesting and you wont get bored by it for sure. just go for it and buy it. you wont regret it ;),True

It is a sorry excuse for a ""Horror"" game and functions more as an abstract 3d fighting game.

I give this game 3 Legion fatigues out of 5",True
good game,True
"     I recommend this game for two reasons: 1) its current state and 2) its potential.

     As the game currently stands, it’s a lot of fun. Working together with strangers to operate a pseudo-military unit is a rewarding experience. Finally capturing a town after hours of pushing through enemy defenses feels all the more satisfying when you consider the amount of player coordination that went into the push, but also into the logistics that supported it. I don’t know of that many current games that give so much trust to the players to make the situation work.

     However, that trust comes at a cost, which leads me to the discussion of potential. While there is a functional, albeit relatively underused, squad system in Foxhole, team coordination goes through phases of efficacy. At some points, logistics and strategic offensives work nearly effortlessly to keep the war machine going, but at other times it simply doesn’t happen. Logistics will slow down drastically, or lose its leadership, while the front line soldiers will start to lose direction, and die needlessly. This is really where the future of the game will live or die. Fortunately, the developers are working on addressing these issues through both patches and an announced major gameplay shakeup. If they can pull it off, Foxhole’s unique experiences will become more consistently engaging, and hopefully attract more skeptical buyers. Otherwise, I am worried that this game will slowly shrink into obscurity, an outcome that would sadden me greatly.

"There are only really two words I can describe this game by: Awkward and clunky.

It's everywhere from movement, combat, hit detection and dialogue, even down to the fact that saving costs ""money"", and that it's really easy to lose a bunch of progress with all those factors and lack of autosaves or checkpoints.

Now, lack of autosaves/checkpoints and paid for saving would not necessarily be a bad thing if the rest of the game was there to support it, but sadly the floaty movement and unreliable hit detection combined with being stuck with a very short ranged melee weapon for frankly too long don't do the game any favours. And that's even without going into the floaty mess that is the camera.",False

"700 hours in, i'd like to address some of the negative reviews that were written during the free weekend.

A lot of negative reviews came in from people who don't understand what kind of game this is, and reviewed it like it's supposed to be call of duty. Negative reviews for aspects that are integral to this game such as no minimap, no killcams, no killfeed/kill indicator, limited availability of vehicle and ordinance assets and big emphasis on voice communication. 

These things are the way they are in Squad because together they create an atmosphere that arcade shooters do not understand and do not achieve. These ""negative"" elements make the game more immersive and more intense. 

By limiting the information you as a solider receive with no minimap or orange chevrons on all the enemies, you feel less safe and more scared. You use your map to navigate the terrain like you would in real life. You rely on communication to find the enemy. You play slower and use your senses more. 

Not knowing how you die is frustrating, but relays the chaos of a military engagement. Squad has a lot of slow parts, a lot of running a good distance from a distant, hidden spawn point to the action, or a long flank hidden behind a hill to take out a defending squad. These dull moments are essential because they make the action so much more intense. When things go from 0 to 100 in squad it's incredible, with bullets cracking through the air all over, explosives going off and everyone freaking out in local voice scrambling to find cover. The chaos, the not knowing exactly what's going on, the need to rely on your teammates to accomplish the game's goals, this is an essential aspect of this game and what makes it so great.

When I play battlefield things are SUPER intense 100% of the time all the time. And it works for a few hours and then... it just becomes the norm and its dull. Squad takes you on these great highs and lows and delivers situations and battles that are unforgettable. 

Almost a year since early access release, and I commend the dev team. They have been stellar, super communicative in the forums and reddit, working hard, listening very closely to the community and supporting them. The game has evolved very nicely a year in, and we can't wait to see what is going to come.

The squad playerbase is stellar. Many great adminned servers and many great clans and communities full of great people. They organize community events like clan fights or modified gameplay sessions (hardcore one life events etc).

People in game are friendly and helpful, many of us have made a lot of friends playing this game. There are trolls, tkers, and occasional hackers, but show me a game that doesn't have those.",True

"Wow this game has come a long way. The spaceships fly like spaceships, the PvP feels good, everything is destructable and/or buildable. Want to make a giant space bee? I did! I shared the blueprint with a friend and we tried to start a hive! We were defeated in glorious battle but it was still fun. You can get really creative and make complex assembly lines, space stations, moon bases, automated defense asteroids, space elevators ... just get the game and start building already!",True
"The base game is a decent toolkit and can serve as an introductory course for the modded content . (sort of like XCOM for LongWar for those in the know ..)

What this game has and very few others of this type of game have (that I know of) is a stellar comunity of high grade modders with access to modding tools that where the stuff of dreams up until soon .. ( look up harmony patching  ) . 

As long as this phenomenal modding comunity is allowed to do its thing, even greater things are going to come out of it . ( the scope of changes from RogueTech mega mod pack so soon after the game's release is already mind boggling - already surpasing the scale of XCOM Longwar simply because the tools available are so powerful and the community so talented and motivated) ..

"Hoo boy, it's finally time. I finally bought Below Zero. I was holding off because I figured that my fairly weak laptop would struggle even more with this game than the first, and while that was true of snowstorm particle-effects I'm so rarely above water during a storm that it doesn't matter.

This game is terrifying. I love it. Some resources are now overly abundant where they used to be decidedly scarce after just a few hours, but batteries and power cells are now the most precious and expendable resource available. The basic enemies in the first hostile biome are faster, smarter, more maneuverable, hit harder, and are overall far more deadly and scary than the Stalkers of Subnautica. Heck, they seem tame in comparison. And that's just the first zone!

I love this game, and am very excited for all the upcoming updates and performance improvements. It feels easier to get into than the original Subnautica, but brings all the experience of the team to create an even more immersive and terrifying experience for the player. Can't wait to see what new horrors Unknown Worlds has devised in the depths of this new title.",True

"Absolutely great game! Lovely graphics and details of the nature, survival, expecially also sounds are great. For an Alpha better then lot of released games.
Feels like in jungle surviving.
Me hope that release game will be with the option to be less frightening;) This indios just shopping up random with spears just wanna eat you! Me not so like this aspect. Still want to have some action, but also interaction with indians would be great...may help them so they help you...some might be agressive but should not be all of them.
My comment like this since I game to relax from work, etc. and not to get stressed too much;)
But absolutely great. Concrats to the developer.

>After 20hrs of enjoying this great game
...But to the developers things to fix:
- spawn of food and ressources is too random and just spawning!!
Figured out that instead of starving and running around, just reload until there is plenty of food?!;) Not the sense of such a game and close to a big BUG.
Sometimes you can cross all map and not find 1 banana...sometimes there are 50+ just around..
I think everything in this game just spawns random at certain places, player has no influence and not even buildings have to these spawns.
-  Indians, me like to interact and talk to them or try to get in contact.
Not just as now sneak around them or just kill them!? No sense to me.
- Indians should have villages...and maybe pathes were they go hunting...right now just spawn..even at your sleeping place, so just build more than one;)
- Again food, there should be some sort of planting...for fruits, funghis, etc. or at least sort of a  rythm of spwan of them...so you know where to go to find something.
- the eals...ok think there are in amazonas, but why not just put dirt or a plant on the skin to prevent...getting annoying every few minutes to peal them off.

Still great game for an Alpha and hopefully getting much better and more interesting.
Leave it as basic survival as it is. May add some more simple ways to survive and make it less random. Since when you try hard to life in Amazonas then there should not just spawn something in front of you;))",True
I loved the Broken Sword back in High School and decided play it again just to remember how it was. I was so wrong… The game is glitchy and the production quality is awful. The characters are dumb and emotionless. The story is poorly written. That's how it goes after 15+ years.,False

"Update: Game is prone to crashing regularly in a long campaign game. Makes it unplayable even after the starting few turns of play. Can be stabilized after a few graphics tweaks but both crashes and corrupts saves often enough to discourage play. ***NOT RECOMMENDED UNTIL RESOLVED ***

Empire Total War (E:TW) is a RTS set in the 1700's. It has a single player campaign mode on a strategic map which add to the game greatly (and therefore is a shame that is not multiplayer). A worthy successor to the Total War series and an excellent historical battle simulator. 

Graphics are much improved over Mediaeval and Rome TW but the movement controls are worse as the system struggles to path and place units according to their formation and position units around cover: you can often find a unit moving accross the map to nowhere. Indeed AI is generally extremely problematic: units have more of a tendency to not follow movement orders once engaged; units can be blithely matching through enemy ranks as a pitched battle occurs around them; troops will march in front of their own cannons and get killed; horse carriages will go over obstacles (like cannon emplacements and get killed).

Also the campaign game forces storyline battles on you. I had just finished capturing Canada from the French and was ready to re-enter real life when I was thrown into Bunker Hill without warning or explanation and had to fight another battle: a battle I subsequently lost because I had to stop the game and was not allowed to save the game. I had to beat the French in Canada four times before I got the game to a save point where I had won Bunker Hill. This is done for the sake of storyline momentum but but there would have been no harm putting in a save point.

This lack of attention to player experience in interface and storyline is seen also in the exposition in the in-game help. Nowhere does it say that unit will fire into their own troops or how this operates (sometimes they do, sometimes they hit their own troops, sometimes only the enemy), nor how to cancel a building destruction/construction order, how cover works and how units wrap around them, how to cancel a broadside, why are only the first line of troops firing etc. Forums help here but a few more tool tips wouldn't go astray as the experience of using gunpowder weapons is different to the previous more melee centric TW series; archers can arc over troops but muskets travel a flatter trajectory after all.

On broadsides, ship battles are very well done. I haven't player other ship simulators since Port Royal, but it was very satisfying demasting a ship. Again, not a lot of exposition, like that the compass actually refers to wind direction.

Individual unit animations are very good and troops will even jump over obstacles.

Loading times are very slow and the system does not quite know how to handle two monitors.

In all, a very good game that is puntuated by poor AI, poor exposition, forced stroyline battles you cannot save, and no restart button as in other TW games.",False

A few years back when the Enhanced edition came out with Gothic 3 Forsaken Gods and a bunch of other stuff i snagged this game at a GameStop I decided to stop at while going in between states from home to visit family and i saw this game in a nice steel case and it was only $20 at the time so i picked it up and now i have 1 other disc copy as well as all the games on steam! I loved this game normally although VERY buggy before i downloaded the community patch and quest packet! Making the game amazingly better! I still haven't beaten it but i replay it from the start often (as I do with Skyrim) and still manage to love it! It's an experience on its own even if the producers forced its release before it was fully complete and I can only imagine what Piranha Bytes could have done with something pretty awesome already!

"Incredible game, takes a while to figure out how builds work but I quickly became obsessed and spent days not doing anything else but play.

HOWEVER, it’s buggy af. Worked perfectly fine until the second act, then it started getting extremely slow, lagged, choppy to the point of being unplayable. (Apperantly an issue with 4GB rams) So I started all over again, 48 hours of gameplay down the drain but I didn’t mind, it was so much fun to play this game that I actually enjoyed doing everything again, but this time bugs started coming up one after the other. I had to start 8 times over and I’m done, I can’t do this anymore. I cannot go back to that first level one more time. I’ll wait until the next patch to even think about playing again. So consider this before buying.

Another complaint would be the difficulty level. Playing in explorer mode is so easy that there’d be times one character in my group would be able to finish the fight. There’s not much of a challenge and you can pretty much kill every single foe at first try. The classic mode however is so hard that you’ll go through resurrection scrolls like healing potions. There’s no middle ground!

So to sum up, a big middle finger to Larian for coming up with the best game I’ve ever seen and not letting me play it, and not getting back to any e-mails.",False

"""There were only two of us left, Pavle was dead, and Bruno had still not returned from the small apartment building he had said he was going to raid. It was just me and Marko, who was nearly dead from his wounds. I had made the decision to leave Marko alone at the house while I searched for Bruno at the apartment. I knew that he had probably been killed, but we needed the supplies, and I didn't want to give up on Bruno. I set out with a knife; the only weapon we had left, and traveled to the building. All was quiet. I jumped up some rocks to get to the first floor, and headed towards the door in front of me. I opened it, and was aghast at what I saw. A man standing there with a pistol, with blood in a pool around his feet. His wounds looked even worse than Marko's. He raised the gun saying, ""You can't do it man."" As there was no other choice, I ran forward with the knife. He threw several weak punches at me before I struck him down with the knife. He convulsed once, and lay still. Shaking in mixed grief and shock for my actions, I wandered in a daze throughout the house, collecting what I could find. I managed to grab a bandage for Marko. While I was looting upstairs, I found the body of Bruno, clutching a knife. Close by, the bodies of two older people lay, covered in blood. Realization of what Bruno had done struck me like a thunderbolt. He had killed the two older people, and had lethally wounded the man who had tried to protect them. I grabbed what I could and left quickly. I never wanted to go there again. I don't know if my life is worth living anymore if I take the lives of others..."" -Boris

"Payday 2 is an excellent Co-Op Shooter game that features many missions, characters and items with many elements that keep missions unique even after you've played them before. (All though not to the extent of the first game, however, but this game has ALL of the first games content included) Whereas this game has some issues, such as having more enemies that Left 4 Dead, and more difficulties than people in the United States have firearms, the pros of this game overcome the cons by alot. The game is great fun with some friends, and without alike, including both an online and an offline mode. There is sooo much content here, however, you should only buy this game if you can afford the ultimate edition (which is really cheap at a major sale). Also, this game recently completed its story with [spoiler] 2 endings [/spoiler]. Along with that, the develoupers of this game have some excellent live action videos on their youtube channel, which I absolutly love. This game also features crossovers with: pointbreak, hotline miami, goat simulator, scarface and more, which is really great. I would give this game a 38/10.

"Fun little city builder. Very Banished-esque, if a bit easier and with less content/depth. 
I've enjoyed my time so far but would love to see more. More types of resources, mechanics, land-types, buildings, etc. The AI isn't the smartest sometimes either, with peasants starving for no reason and fires spreading right next to a well.

Unfortunately at this time I cannot recommend this game as a full release.",False
"Do not buy this. Do not even pirate this!

This is the black sheep of the Guilty Gear franchise and for good reason. It's a mess. For whatever reason, they decided to mimick the GGX controls, but still keep all of the GGXX mechanics (Dusts are S+HS again, for example.). That's fine, but they also added manual turning, lane switching (like in Fatal Fury) and teams (which are completely irrelevant because you can hit your allies!). The end result is a confusing nightmare. GG is hard, but with all that extra crap added it becomes downright impossible to play.

The modes are pretty bad too. Arcade Mode is like Survival Mode for some reason (and the final boss makes I-No look like a joke), GG Boost Mode is extremely boring and the Robo Ky Factory would have been a cool idea if the game wasn't so bad.

The character graphics also look terrible, but it's just the Isuka colours. You can unlock the #Reload colours and then everyone looks good again. Why would they make all the default colours look so bad, I have no idea.

If they had simplified the controls and designed it as a party game rather than ""#Reload, but with 4 players"", it might have actually been fun!

The only good thing that can be said about Isuka is that the music is amazing, but that's not enough to justify playing it.",False

"To be clear straight from the start, I've spent quite a bit of time on this game, mostly in multiplayer. I really wanted to like it as is, but I simply cannot put myself through the chore to keep playing in it's current state, therefore I do not recommend getting it now.

Despite having a nice atmosphere, soundtrack and a pretty image, game suffers a lot from technical issues. Despite having a rig, which I'd describe to be at the very least decent, the game simply refuses to run well on my machine. I haven't figured out what exactly causes it, but everything points to a game being mostly CPU-dependant, and for some reason it doesn't like to use any of the cores but one (note: I'm running an eight core CPU). Performance is alright at first, but then it just tanks after 10-15 minutes of playing, and it's even worse in multiplayer. Various tweaks suggested online didn't make a cut for me, sadly. That's also with game not being graphically demanding, especially with the current abysmal drawing distance.

Then comes questionable game design choices. Accessing your inventory is usually easy to do, same as controlling the camera. But if you are in some tight spaces, oh boy, you are not going to like it. In this kind of situations you could expect the same kind of responsiveness as from someone having seizures. Clipping of various objects is still an issue (as expected from a game with a terraforming element), but these get out of hand frequently, with your materials dissappearing if you were building up a terrain under them, rovers' wheels clipping through the ground out of nowhere (you are lucky if it's just one wheel), or you getting pushed into the cave way below you if you exit a rover in an inappropriate place.

Even despite that, there's quite a bit of fun to be had, especially if you happen to know someone who also has the copy of Astroneer. Unfortunatly, cooperative play brings in it's own specific breed of bugs on the top of the existing ones. One of the bugs it brings in is with the rovers (do you notice a pattern here?). Whenever another player connected to me exited the vehicle, it was basically a russian roulette whenever the rover would fly away into oblivion, clip through the ground into the cavern way below or just make a meter high jump. When it happened for the first time, I've spent about a third of my total playtime (which is around 7 hours) on building a tower/staircase/whatever the hell to get to these rovers since there were 3 of these initially connected together, with quite a few resources on them too. Let me repeat: 7 hours to get 2 cars down from the skybox. The third one is still there and it still can be seen even on the loading screen. All that chore because of another questionable design choice, which is that every item/vehicle will stay frozen in the air until the player is within the certain radius from them. Needless to say, every time a person I played with exited the rover, it was like a heart attack for me. I was promised a relaxing game and was sweating more than during my average ranked match in League of Legends instead.

To sum it up, I really wanted to like this game as is since it below all the technical issues there's a nice unique concept with quite a promise, albeit currently being a bit shallow content-wise, and that is also the reason why I'm keeping it in my Steam Library. I like the game's premise, but I will definetly wait until I can fully enjoy it without wrestling the controls or game physics. Game is great, but it's simply in too bad of a state from a technical point of view to purchase it right now.",False

"This game is one of the best RPG's around. An excellent story, excellent voice-acting and you really bond with your AI companions, all with their own agenda's.

The graphics are great for its time of release and the story really grips you. Battles take place in real-time, although you can pause at any time during battles to issue orders to your companions. This system works very good. The are moral choices to be made to which certain characters react differently and there are even romancing options ingame. 

There are three races, three classes and each race has its own starting story-arc, depending on race as well as if you choose to be a commoner or royalist. I suggest you try all different story-arcs, you will see that they intertwine in your playthrough.  

The game tends to crash sometimes though, so save often!

"An underated gem, VtM: Bloodlines puts you in the role of a newly embraced vampire amid an ever so dark and oppressive world.  The game offers you a selection of clans to play that each offer their own powers and weaknesses to take into account. An FPS with a touch of RPG elements, you'll gain experience over time to invest into a variety of skills and powers to upgrade and master.  There really is no wrong way to play this game, talking and sneaking through most if not entire levels is just as valid as rampaging through with guns and blades provided you have the skills and ability to back it up.  Your dialouge options can vary from clan to clan along with what abilities you can use to manipulate others, which further provides an incentive to replay this game multiple times with different skills and powers to see what other actions play out.  

Melee combat switches you to third person giving you a better range of vision as you block, evade, and strike enemies; while ranged fighting allows you to switch to third but also first person for making those more carefully aimed shots.  The stealth mechanic is pretty simple, just crouch and stay around dark areas.  Your stealth skill makes you harder to be spotted and if you get behind someone without notice you can instant kill.  

Blood is your source to power abilities and help keep you from frenzying (losing control of yourself), so getting blood is crucial.  You could get it from someone covertly like a person you charmed at a bar or hire an escort, you could buy bags of blood from some who are willing to sell, or you could even take it from combatents you fight by grappling to overpower them. The options you take are up to you.

 Bloodlines also has its share of a few bugs and hiccups for which I recomend you look into the unofficial patch fix which remedies that.  Without spoiling anything, the story is nicely done and definitely worth the playthrough.",True

"I think it is past time I put in a review for a game that has absorbed one hell of a lot of my life.  
Its worth noting that, as I write this, the game has only been ""officially"" released for about a month, however, I have played on and off since the first day of Alpha.  I have currently put 243 hours into this game, and 297 into KF1, which shows, if nothing else, that I like these games a lot.  

Is it like KF1? 
Probably not.  It looks like KF, it feels like KF when you play it.  But the classes are different, leveling is faster and more rewarding, the guns are more restrictive (due to its age) as are the maps (custom included).  There are now microtransactions akin to CS:GO.  There are new zeds, but they are mostly variations on the current ones, and so far only crawlers, clots, and soon gorefasts.  There are two bosses, which is very nice since some classes have a distinct advantage against one vs the other (sharpshooter wrecks hans and commando can make the patriarch fight a joke).  The game also feels easier, by and large, but that could be a result of time put in.
In short, it's not the same game, and some people really hate change, but to me, this game is a lot better as a whole, it just still feels young.

There's a lack of custom maps and mutators in size and scope of the original.  That isn't to say there aren't some amazing maps out there (Mario64 & Kokiri Forest), as well as old maps that have returned thanks to the community (West London, Mansion, Office, & Biotics Lab).  But the much larger maps that incorported some interesting mutators (like the RE and Aliens series with custom zeds; Mysterious Trees [my absolute favorite] with random spawning of massive hordes of zeds) have yet to return.  



I'm going to focus on the cons more here in an attempt to be more critical.
PROS:
- Very fun weapons (pulverizer & microwave gun notably)
- Zed diversity is increasing, which is much appreciated (still hoping for scrake and fp diversity)
- The classes feel well rounded for the most part.
- it feels and looks like an improved KF1
- they are bringing back holiday events!

CONS:
VS mode, just as a concept, feels like a waste of time by the Devs
Microtransactions.  I don't particularly mind the concept, but it seems the free drops consist of one of 5-6 things at this time.  That should be a expanded to a greater diversity as new items are released to bring market cost down a bit.  Or at the very least implement more into the game, make some market only and others earnable through achievements or something.
Classes:
- Survivalist needs refined (but as I write this, I'm sure that's currently happening)
- I like most of the other ones, commando seems boring nowadays, zerker will benefit from more tankiness (but they are doing that currently with the taunt and shield), and demo escapes me.
- still hoping for LMG
- would be nice if they increase the level cap or add prestige with benefits someday
Guns:
- Every class could benefit from more t2-t4 gun options.  I'm sure this is coming, but its been slow thus far.  Its a bit frustrating to get into a monotony in buying certain guns certain waves to hit the end ""set"" which seems necessary for a boss fight.  Diversity would really be helpful. 
- I think there needs to be some weight distribution or more utility in the ""t2"" set.  In several of the classes, I never buy the t2 weapon unless there is some odd money constraints (e.g., death/late join).  Weapons such as the xbow, hunting shotgun, trench gun, and vlad go by the wayside because they are sufficiently better than t1 to justify not conserve money waiting for t3/t4.
Talent Trees:
- Every talent tree should have three options per tier, not two.
- Some of the talent trees are very forced (a healing-dedicated medic must choose the left side.  Since there is only one   healer  class, it'd be nice to see an option of HoT vs big heal / big cd vs armor regen.  Or maybe I've played too many MMOs.

Plenty of zombies around, but they only want to steal your kills. Bots ignore zombies. Bots do not shoot special zombies unless they are far away or they have already been seen by the player. Bots who usually are behind you, shooting you in the back of the skull, walk in front of you to block Grenades from a grenade launcher or to protect the witch, tank, smoker, etc by taking the shot themselves. Bots who usually ignore boomers shoot at it if you are close to it.

"So I got a lot to say about conjuring house. I wanna start with the more pressing issues that should be relatively easy to fix. I'm experiencing an unbearable amount of screen tear on a r7 1700 rx 580 rig so that desperately needs a fix. There's also a bit of judder as well. So these need to be fixed ASAP as they make the game pretty annoying to play.

Now on to the real meat and potatoes of the review. First and foremost I want to applaud the devs for the sound design and the set pieces the game is absolutely gorgeous. This is well in line with games like resident evil 7. Full marks for the graphics, but as we all know graphics aren't everything.

The real problems with the game starts with the enemy placements and types. The game is confusing with many locked doors scattered everywhere especially throughout the start of the game, this would be totally fine if it weren't for the obnoxiousness of the enemy. The demon can walk through walls, and can teleport in the direction you're running. This makes the game less scary and more annoying because it forces you to backtrack the same hallway again hoping that she will respawn in front of you again to continue progression (unless I'm doing it wrong). This makes the entire experience totally unfun for the player. The problems with players like me are that I can easily predict all of the jumpscares and cliches this game throws at me, which is also fine. If it weren't for the fact that I seemingly have to replay them over and over if I am one shot by the same enemy. 

You guys should consider increasing the enemies speed, but preventing her from teleporting in front of you, it's equally hard but a bit more fair for the player.

I'll probably do another attempt at a low chaos playthrough soon. Also I think I'll go back and play through the first Dishonored now.",True

"Contrary to some reviews, mouse controls are included and quite intuitive, once you understand them. 

Remember that this game is a mobile port. To move Lara with the mouse, you click-and-drag Lara to the space you want her to move to. Unusual, I know, but remember that the game was built with swiping in mind. Controller support was tacked-on, and is actually my biggest gripe with the game - it's hard to know exactly which direction you're supposed to move the thumbstick when you're on walls, and so I often resorted to using the (more precise) mouse for these sections. I do wish there was WSAD and D-Pad support though.

The levels have a gorgeous low-poly aesthetic and the difficulty scales well, with spikes in only a few areas (mostly toward the end). There's no penalty for using the hint system, which is great: it walks you through step-by-step, and allows you to disable it and continue on your own, once you figure out what you were doing wrong. I'd go so far as to say this is the most well-implemented hint system in any puzzle game I've ever played.

So yeah, the controls aren't great, but they aren't terrible, and the game overall is very well done. Recommended.",True

"a friend of mine challanged me to finish this game with NO help or tips from any walktrough. if i did, i'd get the game and ~50-60$ and i gotta admit, i enjoyed it so much more! 

all puzzles are logical, you gotta pay attention and you gotta try to tackle some puzzles from outside the box!
only very basic knowledge are required with electrition, math and chess.

i only got stuck twice out of my own derp. mixing left with right and the 2nd time were actually due to a glitch of a door open without me even knowing of the lever to open it. [spoiler] where the lever were had some importance[/spoiler] so i ignored it, or rather didn't pay too much attention and were stuck for about an hour.

"This may not look too intense, but I found some puzzles reasonably tricky!  Definitely relied on the paper-and-pencil method a few times, and at one point crowd-sourced potential solutions from friendsl.  I'm not sure if this speaks more for the challenge of the game or to my inability, but either way it was enjoyable.

The plot itself was unique.  Definitely intriging.  The ending was a bit of a disappointment, but I imagine that's what sequels are for!  I purchased this on sale, so it was definitely worth the money, but I would recommend maybe waiting for another sale before picking it up.",True
"Addictive gameplay.  Punishing difficulty.  Merciless storytelling.

With spot-on Lovecraftian atmosphere and a unique visual style to emphasize and reflect it, Darkest Dungeon does ruthlessly compelling Gothic horror roguelike with brutal elegance.  If this sounds like the kind of ancient, cyclopean architecture you'd enjoy relentlessly pounding your head against as madness slowly takes hold, then this is the game for you... you poor, ill-fated thing.

If I had to complain about anything in Darkest Dungeon, aside from the vast spans of my life the game has sucked into its endlessly hungering maw, it would be that the gameplay can become fairly repetitive.  However there is always a challenge to be had, as even the most routine delve can be a party's last and, combined with two transformative DLCs, I feel like that constant sense of danger and tension more than makes up for a relatively short gameplay loop.  If this is your genre in the sense of story and game style, then you'll hardly care about the grind, and even if it is not, I'm confident most people would get enough hours out of this game to more than justify the purchase price.",True

Make no mistake though; the difficulty of La-Mulana is brutal. Partly due to its gameplay, but mostly due to its puzzles. Have a pen and paper handy because it's that kind of stuff. Riddles, traps and permanent changes to the dungeons.

As for my play time; I picked this up via Playism before the steam release and sunk about 60 hours in it without managing to beat it. I later bought it on steam for a second attempt and while I got further I still never managed to beat it. I admit defeat, but the journey was a blast.

As a longtime fan of the genre, I typically love any game that follows the classic point and click RPG format of King's Quest, Kyrandia, Full throttle, etc. I love that these games are coming back, with a great resurgence in the Tell Tale games series, The Silent Age, and more. However- Kaptain Brawe just sucked. While the artwork is nice and certainly original, the puzzles have remarkably little logic. A lot of the game made no sense, and seemed to depend upon you having some innate knowledge that simply hadn't been imparted by the story. It's also way too short for what you pay. I appreciate that the designers may have been trying to pay homage to the classics, but Kaptain Brawe is simply not worth your money.",False

"Finally! A positive review for a visual novel. Not neutral or ""somewhere-in-the-middle"" or just plainly meh, but not meh enough to give it thumbs down. A true positive review for truly good game. And to be honest, I didn't expect this one to be good - creators of VNs with h-content often forget, that they are still creating VISUAL NOVEL, so a game that should be base on solid story and not merely anime boobs. Luckily, this title doesn't have that problem.

[b]Pros:[/b]
+[b]Graphic.[/b] Let's start with something obvious here. Characters, CGs, backgrounds - everything looks good and consistent.
+[b]Music.[/b] It changes! I know, it shouldn't be something surprising, but after playing dozens of VNs with same looping music that never reflect the atmosphere of scenes... It truly is. And it's nice music too. Even the casual tune in the background that plays when you're raising stats is rather enjoyable and doesn't get annoying.
+[b]Plot.[/b] This is a school-life simulator with sci-fi elements. I must admit that the story is really well written. For the first half of the game it's very light-hearted and funny, but when you're on specific route, it get a bit darker and more serious turn. 
+[b]Writing.[/b] Really good. Most of the time dialogues looks realistic. You know, like part of conversation that could happen in the real life, as oppose to dialogues in many VNs.
+[b]Characters.[/b] I'm surprised, but I actually liked all of characters. Little sister was a bit annoying, but she was supposed to be, so it didn't bother me. Other girls have their own personalities, they were unique and likeable. They were acting like people, you know, actual GIRLS instead of CUTE-SWEET-ALWAYS-INTO-YOU. (*cough* Princess Evangile. *cough*)
+[b]Protagonist.[/b] Funny! Liekable! Relateable! With his own personality. He actually says a lot of reasonable things about relationships and what is important for him in terms of love, instead of just being a perv. This is a huge contrast to most h-content VNs and even protagonists in general (male or female) - they often tend to lack personality and when you think about it, there is literally not a single reason why other characters would be interested in them. Here protagonist is really cool, reliable and friendly guy, so it's not surprising that he's gaining popularity. 
+[b]Gameplay.[/b] This is a stat raising game, so if you don't like that, you may be a little annoyed with that aspect (though there are few difficulty levels, so even if you're not good with that sort of things, you should not have problems to finish the game). I enjoyed it very much. Not only you're raising your personal stats and earning money like in many VNs, but also managing three clubs and trying to make them win championship. 
+[b]Challenging.[/b] If you don't like challenge - you set easiest difficulty and you're good to go. But if you like managing stats, there are higher difficulty to picks, which is awesome.
+[b]Setting.[/b] Game doesn't take place on Earth. It's alternate universe with alternate time system, many timeliness and typical science fiction stuff. Yet it's very well done and doesn't ""override"" the whole school-life concept.
+[b]Well done.[/b] Really. I haven't encountered any bugs, everything looks good, everything sounds good, you get all options you may need and of course big resolution - which, sadly, still isn't something ""normal"" even for very pricey VNs.

[b]Cons:[/b]
-[b]Subjective route-specific things.[/b] I will mention them below.
-[b]Too long.[/b] The last three months of the game were the most boring ones. There wasn't many events, just few scenes, so basically you're just focused on raising stats. The bad thing is, at this point, if you were managing them well, you pretty much have it all under control, so... At this point you just clicking randomly to get to the next scene. And those doesn't happen often.

[b]Routes:[/b]
Currently I just finished one route, but I'm planning to do more, so this review will be upgraded in near future. There won't be any plot-related spoilers here, just my opinion after finishing route.

[i]Chigara[/i] - For the first half of the game I liked her the most, so that's why I went with her. To be honest though, her route was kind of awkward and disappointing. Instead of being just loveable, a bit shy girl, she turns out to be... Eee... Very child-like, and that bothered me a lot. Especially during H-scenes. She doesn't know anything about sex. And no, I don't mean the fact that she doesn't have experience. She acts like she literally have no idea how this works, so I felt kind of bad at this point. And her childlish-like behavior doesn't help. Also [spoiler] if you let go the thing that you want, instead of fighting for it, you simply don't deserve it[/spoiler]. So I started liking her a lot and ended up feeling kind of ""meh"" and ""nope"". Not sure if I would recommend her for a first route.",True

"I was torn between giving this a positive or negative review but ended up siding with positive due to it still being an enjoyable game. With that being said it still has a lot of flaws that I find irritating. The first thing I do for every game is go to the key binding to understand how to play, but game doesn't even list the keys to use. Sure there is a tiny tutorial at the start, but it does not tell you that the up key is your hero skill, or that shift key is your mount skill. Aside from that tiny tutorial, the game does not tell you anything else and it will ruin many first time players. For example cutting down trees around camps will make them disappear rendering you unable to recruit new people or get rid of your trader. I understand that it wants you to explore and discover things on your own, but if you are like me you will be spending more time looking up how to do stuff than actually playing the game. 5.5/10 buy when it is on sale....",True

"Long Story short: had it on Xbox, bad performance. Now on PC with vega 56, 16 GB ram and ryzen 3600 and again bad performance, but I found the reason, I just don't know how to fix it yet, should be fixed by the developers though. My gpu usage goes from 100% to about 30% in large areas, the framerate is bad then, the reason it does this, is because my cpu bottlenecks on 2 of the virtual 12 cores in this game (100% usage). Strange is, that this is depending on if you look up the sky or look at the scenery, normally only the gpu usage should be high if looking into the scenery. If I remove the ability for the game to use those 2 cores via the task manager, the next 2 cores start having 100% usage and so on. When I decreased the particle settings it may helped a bit but I'm not sure.

EDIT: Turning the Object Detail down from Very High to High and the Shadows down from Very High to High gives a huge performance boost or the other way around - If bumping up Shadows from High to Very High and Object Detail from High to Very High really stresses the CPU to the max (YES I meant CPU and not GPU) if looking at much gras (Shadows) or at buildings/many objects in your screen space (Object Detail), what comes with a negative trade of around 60 fps in my case with my specs depending on the scenery.",False

"After reading through negative reviews I came to the conclusion that they didn’t seem all that fair and so I decided to write this review which I will aim to keep reasonable short, concise and fair.

The first thing that I think I should mention is that this game is hard and, at times, extremely frustrating; however please don’t write it off just for this reason. With this being said it’s a game I am yet to just quit and forget about, all the deaths which occur seem fair and I was able to get on with the game even if I muttered a few choice words under my breath.

Let’s start with the controls! The default controls themselves are horrendous, but after I spent some time changing the binds around until I found a control scheme which fit the way I play I was able to play with some modicum of ease. Controllers are also supported however I haven’t played with one and so I can’t say anything regarding this method of input. The game also seems to be really picky about the location which you need to stand in order to pick up bodies and objects; you may first think that to pick up an item you need to stand to the side of it as you would in other games, however in Amazing Princess Sarah you are required to stand in the dead centre, which is either in front of it for a game object or on top of it for a body and if you are off slightly you just won’t pick it up – there is no room for error. This mechanic bugs me a lot. On a certain level you are required to pick up and then throw bodies and objects to defeat a boss whilst being on the run the entire time, if you miss even a couple of bodies you’re going to be out of luck and will have to restart the fight; coupled with this awkward mechanic it took me quite a few attempts and several swears to be victorious.

With regards to the controls again, even after rebinding them to suit my play style I still had a lot of trouble stopping in the right places because Sarah seems to have banana peels for shoes, causing her to slide and have trouble stopping where you want her to as well as accurately performing jumps, however that last one might just be because I’m terrible.

I also noted that a quote from the review by digitallydownloaded.net described the game as [i]“One of the best Castlevania-inspired titles”[/i]. If they were referring to the awkward controls that these generations of games had then they are dead on, unlike the jumps I attempted to make.

I know what you’re probably thinking now. “Why would I want to spend my time playing a game with bad controls and awkward mechanics? Why should I bother buying this game now?” Well, allow me to continue.

Despite having extremely awkward controls and mechanics the game is very enjoyable and takes absolutely no prisoners regarding the mechanics and enemies. Save points in this game are statues which automatically save the game as soon as you are close enough, however the trouble with this is that the levels are fairly large and the statues scarce. This means you may have to clear a large section of the level to get to a save point and if you die before you manage to reach one you go straight back to your last save point or, if you haven’t reached one on that level yet, back to the start. You have a set amount of health which increases as you level up and as far as I am aware there is no way to restore your health midgame other than getting a Castlevania-style heart to drop from a defeated enemy or a destroyed game object, however this seems a fairly uncommon occurrence and eve then your health isn’t replenished by much. This isn’t too bad as the enemies don’t deal a great amount of damage but the enemies who do can easily be avoided or killed from a safe position, in fact the only way you die instantly is to pitfalls deaths. 

The game has a variety of different enemies ranging from zombies and skeletons to demonettes and fire elementals each of which have their own attacking style. When an enemy is killed you have a window of time to pick up the body before it fades away to use it as a weapon, when you want to use it as a weapon you throw it using the key you normally use to attack, when the body collides with a solid instance it actives in a unique way for each enemy. I won’t say anything else regarding this in fear of spoilers and to allow you, a potential player, to find out for yourselves and figure out in what situation a specific body would be beneficial. The final enemy I will mention are the Bats, which are seemingly everywhere. There is what appears to be an infinite number of bats flying about on each level in fixed paths and positions whose sole purpose is to distract and infuriate the player by dealing damage to Sarah and knocking her off the platform she just jumped too all the way down to the bottom, this definitely adds to the difficult and charm as well as adding a Castlevania-style feel to the game. If you don’t spend at least 20 minutes trying to navigate a set of platforms in one particular level then you must have hacked the game.

Sarah’s only weapon is a sword which doesn’t do a great deal of damage but can perform critical hits which make up for this. Environmental objects can also be picked up such as grandfather clocks, tables and chairs which can all be thrown at enemies to deal greater amount of damage as well as being able to perform critical hits which deal a very high amount of damage to all enemies. This mechanic is something very out of place in a game about a Princess but it works and it adds to enjoyment of the player and without it the gameplay itself wouldn’t stand up to much.
Amazing Princess Sarah is a very standard 2D platform game with slight RPG elements. Slight elements being you have health which increases as you level up, you gain XP for defeating enemies and you are able to level up to an infinite level. Your goal is to save your father who was seduced and kidnapped by Lilith and to do this you must fight your way through 5 castles. Why 5 castles? The only reason I can think of as to why the developers would make it castles is due to her being a Princess and her father the King. But why would Sarah need to fight her way through 5 different castles to rescue her father? Doesn’t she know where Lilith’s castle is? No could be an appropriate answer for this question, but the concept itself is fairly weak, flawed and quite standard when it comes to these types of games. However this again adds to the nostalgic feel that you are playing an older game.

The game itself is also quite humorous and got a couple of giggles out of me. For one the characters breasts are animated along with her sprite meaning that they move as you move, this is the same for the other female enemies in the game such as the fire elementals and demonettes who also scream for help when you pick them up to throw them. The bosses are very different to what you might expect and are completely out of place for a Princess game, but that’s what makes this game what it is and that is a fun, challenging, frustrating 2D platform game that you’ll want to continue playing until you complete it.

I [b]would recommend this game[/b] if you like 2D platforming games, don’t mind the fact there is no way to change the difficulty which is essentially based on your own skill which builds up as you play, and if you don’t mind the story and enemies which make little to no sense.

If you don’t like difficult and challenging games or 2D sprite based platformer games then this game isn’t for you.
I do believe that anybody can enjoy this game if they are willing to spend time playing it and that if you see it on sale you should definitely pick it up if you’re unsure about it.",True

"Although not the same producers as the Banner Saga, this game has a very similar feel to it; the art, the music, the epic storyline, the turn-based combat.

That said, it's nowhere near as polished as Banner Saga, which is a shame. The art on this game is on par with Banner Saga, but unfortunately, the combat mechanics is not as finely tuned or as well-balanced as the Banner Saga series. Unlike Banner Saga, character progression in this game feels shallow and inconsequential. 

To make matters worse, the script writing is bad and not well put together. You will find that a lot of the conversations with NPCs don't really make sense as you progressed into later chapters.

Still, despite the flaws, I am enjoying the game quite a bit, and would recommend it still if you are a fan of the Banner Saga series.  

Can't help but feel that this game is a missed opportunity. If this had spent more time in development, it could have been a top notch game.",True

"So I bought this game during the winter sale and it was for 6 dollars from its usual 30 dollars (a fantastic deal for a fantastic game. I had not heard of anything about this game other than that it's user reviews were extremely high and it's genre tags were what I was interested in. Going in knowing nothing I was VERY overwhelmed and that is an inevitability for someone who equally doesn't know the mechanics about this game. It's a game of graphs, paragraphs, and statistics as you try and run a country of your choosing. You must appeal to many different types of voters of your choosing through the use of implementing policies each turn (each turn is a quarter of a year ingame). You will need to do this if you want to be re-elected for another term. You must try to do this for as long as possible or you can choose to have a limit to the amount of terms you serve (therefore a definite end to your game). It tracks through your actions if your more conservative, liberal, socialist, capitolist, etc. All of this is fascinating. But by far my favorite thing about this game is its interface. It's very sleek, neat, while complex at the same time. The game has a pretty good tutorial which I highly recommend going through rather than skipping it (I did that on my first try and I regretted it). Know that you will never please all of your voter groups and this can lead to a potential assassinations along the line. Even though this game can seem very overwhelming at first glance, once you beat the learning curve, it is highly addicting and an actual fun way to learn more about political systems (even for people like me who hate politics). 10/10.",True
"Dropping a positive review for the game in these hard times. It's amazing, really, but the most of the people prefere to misunderstand the EULA and downvote it.",True
"I'm sure everyone else has provided adequate summaries of this game. 

Here's my take on it: I absolutely love it. But it's definitely an 'experience it' sort of game. I'm happy to have this game in my collection, even happier to share it with people and watch them play through it. 

This is definitely like playing a 'choose your own adventure', except the narrator is real, and you two have a sick, co-dependent relationship which can only be escaped from through extreme measures. 

It is not a game to slam through, seeing how many hours you can get out of it if you're speeding through it. (Except for one time.) The first time I played through it, I was shocked at the 'short' length of the game. Then as I peeled away the layers, it became more and more involved, and once in a while something will change on its own in the game that is just baffling, sometimes with no explanation. 

I've seen some players have some pretty unique experiences with this game that the community is still unsure of how to recreate. 

If you are really, truly stuck at trying to find some of the endings, I think it's okay to glance through walkthroughs. Just don't peek at what happens at the end! That's the fun of it. 

I'm hoping this game will become a model for more complicated games involving choose your own path adventure games. I wouldn't want to play an exact replica of this game, because I think this game is... it. It did what it set out to do. It's long enough that you get enough endings to feel satisfied, but not overly long that you get tired of it. Basically, play it now while it's fresh, because I have a feeling that we're going to see developers use this game as inspiration.",True

"Quite a realistic way to simulate a prison break. You fight with guards, they'll remember and beat you up everytime they see you, until they've actually beaten you up (I think this is a glitch currently). Beat up other inmates, their opinions towards you decreases . Make their opinions low enough, they'll start attack you when they see you alone in a corner. do favor for the inmates, their opinions towards you increases, and you can recruit them to join you as a gang. 

It feels like it's going to be a long run, not short game, as what you'd expect a prison escape simulator should be. You need to slowly build up your way in order to break out. Tools must be made yourself, and if you dig, you need to remember to flush out the dirt. And yes, there's no guarantee your toilet is functional, if you're in bad luck the toilet will just get clogged.

"I held my hands over my head as artillery shells exploded around my trench. Dazed, I staggered forward, one goal in mind. ""Defend the trench!"" my mantra repeated, beating a tattoo into my consciousness. I reached my pillbox. Crouching, I blew my whistle. My men soon came to the pillbox, posting up around me. Shots rang from my gunner as he killed another enemy. ""All clear!"" I slowly raised myself until I could see out of the makeshift window. I saw movement in some of the underbrush. I called in a mortar shot on that position. Crouching again, I waited, each passing second an eternity. 

...........

A small hiss rose into earshot. I wondered what it meant as my gunner shouted ""Grenade!"" The word was not even out of his mouth as a bright flash errupted just outside of the pillbox entrance. I was knocked senseless. Two things crossed my mind as I faded into darkness; my family, and how I would never see them again, and my joy as I heard my mortar shell strike home. The screams of my enemies became a lullaby as I drifted into oblivion.


10/10

This fps shooter is unlike any I have ever played. Set in WWI era, the bolt action rifle is king. Trenches are your castles, your lives, your tombs. You leave a trench, you die. You stand up, you die. You run zig-zag patterns towards the enemy trench, you die. Somewhere along the way, you start to put everything together. Killing gets easier. You develop a sense of danger, you learn to spot patterns. You discover how close of an ally patience is. Patience leads you to survival, and ultimately, your victory. 

Pros:

-Realistic ballistics

-Good balancing

-Great bonuses for team players

Cons:

-No story mode (not complaining about this, just a head's up for players who are looking for some sort of story/campaign.

On the positive side, the game is as absorbing as ever and is easily a game that you can lose hours on without realising. Depending on your taste,you may find the new levelling mechanic off putting, but I find them more believable than the Oblivion version. But where the game fails slightly is the stability of the engine. Obviously, Bethesda has a history of making large game worlds that are buggier than hell, but I honestly hoped that this newer engine would be different. Unfortunately, it turns out the whole thing is really just a modified version of the Gamebryo engine, which is by now the equivlant of an ancient delorian among ferarris nowadays.

I'm playing as a red lynx named Velvet! This is my first time playing as a red lynx. This is by far one of my favorite games, as with the whole shelter series, and it is just so amazing. Sadly, with Velvet, I lost my dark cub named Hazel to the 'skull storm' stuff. I was running away, trying to get away from this vile and distubring storm, when I heard a clap of thunder and saw a huge bolt of lightning. The storm retreated and I called for my clubs. Were they all alive? I was concerned and surprised, because normally when the storm comes I am at my den with the big tree. This time, though, I was hunting rabbits near the woods. I was too late. Hazel was gone.

"Remember liking it in alpha...  I returned to electron free, dead cold Canada after a year to be delighted by the finished, polished game. Since I had already a lotta hours on record I went straight to Interloper. Sandbox, mind you. Dont know anything about the story, dont care. 

So - after about five ten minute long lives I managed not to get killed by frentic moose, by wolfs, wolfs everywhere and not by the bloody cold. I got to a house, found matches ---Haaallelujaaahhh---. After two nights I died apperantly of bad mood or an evil mountain spirit, because I was just finished eating by a fire in a cabin, well rested and with no afflictions when I strolled outside to look around and found that that dick of a whiny character has too loud heartbeats, blurry vision, and can't walk straight. Condition 9%. What the?... What?... Why?

O.K. - gave it one more try. Killed three rabbits right away. One had to go to a wolf. Still, two rabbits - should keep a man fed for... as it turned out 3 kilos of meat doesn't even half fill your damn stomach. Well, what seemed like a jolly good start ended in death the next morning due to starvation and the fact I didn't drink all the water I could before going to bed.

Yay! 

Other notes on the facts of life in The Long Dark: 
-It is an hour long drudgery to break up a chair so it can fit into a fireplace. It also takes away from you as much calories as you gain by eating whole fkn rabbit. 
-It is impossible to set a book on fire without additional tinder.
-You can walk down a mountain via 80 degree slopes no problemo yet it is impossible for you to walk over na 8 inch high obstacle.
-Wolfs are murderous dicks (fair enough)
-Bears are giant murderous dicks (fair enough)
-Moose are new to the game. They will hunt you down, man.
-Rabbits are suicidal idiots

-It still looks pretty and great and beautiful though.

This is just a point of view of a veeery disappointed early access version player.

"As a fan of Minecraft since the Alpha development for such a long time. I didn't think that Telltale would attempt to make a game based around a open-world sandbox title. They included some mechanics from the game like crafting and building in the story but other than that, its just another point and click game with Minecraft involved. The Voice Actors including the main protagonist can be define as a hit or miss depending on how you think of them. The animation in the gameplay/cutscenes can also be a hit or miss, because the way they move and interact in my opinion seems a tad awkward in some cases.


Closing arguments:  I would only recommend you play this game if you played Minecraft or have decent knowledge about it or just a fan of Telltale games altogether (Walking Dead, Wolf Among us, etc). But you're expecting more than just a point and click adventure then this game will probably draw you away.

"The  parts of the game that I played are great, I played for 12 hours straight one day. Then I came across the Leonardo missions, and like many other people could not steer the bomber, I tried everything that was said in forums but none worked. But, that was just a side quest so I just said meh, who needs it.

I got all the way to seq 9, and I was like oh shit boys I'm ready, I was staring down the head of the Borgia, but the fight wouldn't trigger and he was stuck there with no collision just fighting some random grunts, I tried again some of the things forums suggested but none have worked yet, verifing game cache right now.

Along with moments of pure frustration when the controls make you jump off a borgia tower, it has to be negative.

And I know that I most probably could fix my game but backing up my save and reinstalling, but why should I have to.

But a positive is I didn't have to do anything to get a screen res for a 21:9 monitor.

I recommend this game, though not highly as some of the writing and dialogue can be a bit predictable, lackluster, and unintentionally funny.

"Seems to be a paraphrase of Yume Nikki but with zero atmosphere or purpose.


The gameplay is just the player warping into tiny little maps about the size of the game window; and you walk a second to the left or right to jump to a new map. The maps are filled with specific environmental assets which either give items or require items to trigger something else. So it's just one big item fetch quest. Once the initial wonder wears off, it's just a chore of taking whatever item to whatever thing to trigger whatever code to get a new item to do it all over again with but now on a different random thing.

There's no story or anything, and the environments are just kind of inane pseudo-surreal whatever the developer could come up with. The music and designs of the environments are alright, but since each environment is literally only the size of your screen and you constantly are jumping between them; there's zero room for atmosphere or immersion. Because you are constantly leaping to completely difference scenes with no thematic correlation.

It's slow too, the triggers on starting to walk and interacting with anything has a small delay on it. If you need to find a specific asset you just have to dial until a map with it comes up on the preview. Wandering around, using every item you have on every single thing since you have no idea what kind of combination it could make. Some of them are logical while others are not.

There's nothing interesting to read, there's no meaning to any of the worlds or items. And there's no gameplay of any kind it's just collecting then using items. There is just no sense of purpose to the world or passion in its design, this game just seems to exclusively exist as a shallow paraphrase of Yume Nikki. It feels like a paraphrase of Yume Nikki but meant for children.


I cannot say that I gained a single thing from playing this; it doesn't have any gameplay so it's not really fun, it doesn't have a story or artistic vision to the world so it wasn't meaningful, and there's no cohesion to the different worlds so it wasn't even immersive.

I wandered around for awhile, and it didn't take long before I had seen almost every map type. Then it just became me wandering back and forth between areas I have found, using items on things trying to get some kind of reaction. Until I just got bored and stopped. I got nothing out of playing this, the hour I spent on it might as well have not existed at all.",False

"The Crew 2 review - 
Pros: 
I bought the game for 18 bucks

Cons:
slow loading [Revised review: 2019 with an SSD now, still loads pretty slowly]

[Revised review additional info: game has caused a bluescreen of death on me just because i was running something else in the background]

unchangeable FOV (for single monitor users) [Revised review: 2019, still no way to change FOV for single monitors)

un-optimized [Revised review: 2019, game is still un-optimized]

weather effects are map wide (gotta love when it snows in vegas)

map looks less like america than how it looked in the crew 1

photo mode's focus setting instant crashed me when i increased it ONCE from 0

graphics are terrible play-doh than the crew 1 (unless you want that FPS drop you get from ultra)

THERE IS NO SEPARATE KEYBINDINGS BETWEEN VEHICLES TYPES

Horrible intro to the controls when you first start the game up, the plane i had to re-bind the throttle keys AND still missed 2 checkpoints cause the plane would not go up


Overall Opinion - it's a leap of faith into a concrete road, at the bottom of hell, while going through a blender....major step down from the first crew game.

My specs -

"7/10 (for now, lotta potential with active devs)

I've played just a few games, and so far i like where this is going.  An arena kind of thing with NPC's sprinkled in to add to the treasure and give you something to shoot at till your first player stumbles on you, then it's a real fight.  The cannons take a bit of getting used to, but once you get the physics worked out its pretty fun.  3 races to choose from with 3 ships each, and all with their own clear strengths and weaknesses.  I can't say much about the graphics, i have to play on lowest settings (my trash comp :D) but they look very pretty even at that level.  Considering the fact that this is all still early beta (Early access, whatever they call it), it's pretty fun.  Price is probably a little steep for what it offers now, but the developers are active, and they have a really clear plan (roadmap) on what they plan to do, and in the end i feel ill be getting my monies worth from the game :)",True
"Beautiful game.  The visual display of physics is very life-like.  Unfortunately, I found the controls a little bit frustrating.  The game is not easy and becomes a bit disappointing.  Since the price is of the game is relatively low ($9.99), I will award it 8/10.",True

"Donut County at first looks like a rebrand of the .io app game featuring the same expanding hole mechanic- really similar to katamari Damacy. I learned very quickly after playing further into the story that this wasn't the case. The storyline of Donut County is amazing. The character development of the few spotlight characters is touching, and the entirety of the dialogue is quirky and fun. The atmosphere of the game is very relaxed and the more challenging puzzles are not even remotely frustrating, even when you're stuck. This game is wonderful. The soundtrack is terribly wonderful and the art style is calming and minimalist. It far exceeded my expectations. I would recommend it to anyone. Replay value 8.5/10",True

"The game may be enjoyable for some but for a Darksiders fan like myself, this is no longer darksiders it's a Souls like game and it's a major turn off. I might as well go play darksouls.

Combat is fun but  annoying at the same time, the dodge mechanic to counter is not forgiving. The sound ques and time window/animations are very lackluster in my opinion.

Platforming in this game is honestly awful, the game feels *updated* but still using 2000's games platforming where you just double and triple jump everywhere instead of dashing across avoiding bombs. Now i have not completed this game so that may be unlocked further into the game but I feel like that is a major mechanic needed early on to match the character and weapon play style.

All in all it's a decent game, I am just disappointed in the path that has been taken for darksiders and now with them releasing Genesis, it feels like they want the series to be everything not continue it's own uniqueness.",False

"Initial Review:
Fuck this Fucking dogshit sad excuse of a game.
Pathetic and Overall ""FUCK YOU"" attempt of a plot; The storyline mocks you, the secrets are a fucking joke on their own sense, of all the 30+ secrets only one is really useful to try and form any sad attempt of lore this game has.

Buggy broken mechanics; the fucking katana swinging and missing something right infuckingfront of you, when you move everything seems to move fucking quicker than you do, ai's bullshit aim and predictablity.
And with a game where you control time you'd assume that you would be able to predict shots and prefire in a sense. In very few cases are you actually able to do that, pistols are only effective medium to rightinyourfuckingface range, Assault Rifles are fucking garbage, Don't even fucking try to use them unless you're speeding up time and actually using it like an assualt rifle. The only good gun in this game is the Shotgun, with a very useful spread that you can often take down groups of enemies, which is far more reliable then the AR.

This game isn't worth the fucking 30$ it is, it isn't even worth the 17$ I spent on it, It should be on sale for 5$ or under, the story you can beat in under 2 hours, the secrets you can do in another 30 minutes. The only thing left are the challenges which are all fucking dogshit variations of the base game. The devs of this are fucking lazy assholes who are after one thing and one thing only, the fucking money in your pocket

3/10 Is being fucking generous for this garbage, maybe when I fully beat all the challenges and that garbage I'll have a sudden sense of enlightenment but for now this games remaining a 3/10



15 Hours In:
Ok I can see how some people can find this fun, quite a few of the challenges were, enjoyable and not bullshit, yet I'm still only halfway through them. Gotta say my favorite challenge so far is Ghost, because I never Hotswitched in the orignal base game, atleast not a whole lot. I'm gonna update my review to be a 5/10, only because I'm getting better at it and enjoying it a HELL of a lot more than the last time



Final Words:
Its an ALRIGHT game, by no means is it worth the full price, or any potential sale price, I'd pay at max $5 for this. I can't believe I'm saying this aswell, but I'm actually enjoying the game, and having fun doing the challenges, I just wish there was more level variety, or  a community level editor. Varietys the spice of life kids, and the same levels rehashed for challenges can get boring quick.

Valve shows off their impressive knack for game design all through the DNA of this game. Satisfying shooting, great music and audio cues, game still looks pretty good, though the zombie animations are a little funny. Great amount of base campaigns, including all of L4D! The characters in this game have fantastic personality and make each campaign full of fun and humor. Even after 180 hours I still laugh at lines of dialogue I've heard many times, it's just good fucking writing, man. The same can certainly be said for the L4D campaigns and survivors, No Mercy will forever be one of my favorite... things in gaming. Everything about it, I love, my nostalgia is seeping through... Can't be all nostalgia, though, even after all these years I keep playing and wanting to replay it, it's just fun!

A great implementation of the Steam Workshop seals the deal, you will find many custom campaigns, of which you can even find pub games for! I have played through the entirety of Silent Hill 2 with random people in a pub game. That's the power of L4D2. Skins and models for all weapons, survivors, infected, and more will keep the game fresh beyond its natural life, which is actually incredible to begin with for a game that has no meta progression. This is just an extremely tight exercise in game design, extremely fun and satisfying, a great co-operative experience where each campaign has the team relying on each other to pull through successfully.

I think my only criticisms is that it can be difficult to keep track of things, and you have to physically go back to the body in question to view the memory again. Towards the end of the game, there's bodies everywhere, and finding the desired information can be a challenge. Remembering where a detail is, etc. I feel if you could access scenes from the book itself, it would streamline the process of deductions in the later game. It make also benefit from an in-game note pad of sorts.

+Fantastic and spooky atmosphere.

+The opening episode is fantastic. Super creepy.
+The buildup to the finale is awesome. Eerie and dread-inducing.

Cons:
-Extremely short for $10. As in, 150 minutes will finish the game and net you all achievements. Sale worthy.
-One of the most disappointing endings that could've been delivered. It's a complete story and the ending doesn't feel improvised but what a waste of potential. Do not hold your breath for some popcorn-worthy revelation. It's so depressing and just not interesting enough.
-No real reason to revisit once completed. 
-Letterboxes. That is all that needs to be said.

"[b] This is not Arma [/b]

This game is heavily inspired from Counter Strike series and I can kind of feel grain of Battlefield sometimes coming into the play. It's fun, no doubt. 
Over 10h of playtime (as of when I'm writing this review) I experienced leading a 3 man squad without saying a single word and only using gestures, TONS of suicides, epic mag stealing from teammates and so much more. The experience is simply unique.

I didn't buy it expecting some ""Arma but on CS maps"" game, i bought it mainly because it'd be one of few VR titles i could properly run on most maps. It is casual and good fun, it can get tough sometimes but mostly you can have a great time even if you are on the losing side.
The game offers usual plant&defuse gamemode, a deathmatch and team deathmatch mode, GunGame, TTT, something similar to CoD:Zombis and even jailbreak, i'm sure you'll find your cherry there.

The players I have run into so far have been fun to play with and the $1,000,000 Enterprise Starter kit got me going right off the hop with some nice cars and properties.

"I played the tabletop game some 20+ years ago. I was young enough back then that I had no tolerance for the pace of the game and never truly got ""into"" it. As such, I'm a reviewer with no lore experience who barely made it beyond amateur in the board game. I recommend this game, in any case, because I experienced a great deal of enjoyment in completing the story campaign.

The campaign story is quite functional, and has only a few cut-scenes, which matches my preference. When I buy a game, I'm happier to find it's actually a game instead of a movie. 

Excellent turn-based action, and if you are like me in that the game isn't already second nature, you've got a lot of learning to do. The good news is that you can ""restart mission"" as often as you need to figure yourself out. There's no shame in this, and it's fun to continually discover smarter ways to play. :) 


Complaints:
1) I bought the expansions about a week before they announced that development is mostly dead. (I'm in 1.8, and 1.9 is declared as the last update.) As such, the game will probably be on massively discounted sale soon. Such is my luck.

2) Mech design is a little disappointing. Though the game presents a perspective of offering significant possibilities, I found only a few and got pigeon-holed in your approach. Mech design was more about flying around to different shops to see which two stores in the galaxy had gauss ammo than it was about ""trying new things."" Course, your mileage may vary.

3) UI is pretty good for a game of this type, though the ""fast combat mode"" is still a little too slow. Waiting for missile animations gets really old, especially when they're launching from one map edge to the other. The camera bouncing during animations is really annoying, too; really fking annoying.

4) The expansions didn't extend the campaign that I can see; they simply added some new equipment into the campaign so one could replay the experience.

Recommendation:
Get it all, but as the game is officially end-of-life as of 1.9, expect it to go on a massively discounted sale soon. Wait until then.

"More a strategy game than a city builder (although they have now added a sandbox mode).

You start on a small island and are given a choice of two 'packs', e.g. lumber camp or seaweed farm. The pack will include a few buildings which you have to place on the island to try and get the highest score, so a lumber camp will get more points for the more trees within its radius but lose points for another lumber  camp within that radius. Hit the points target shown and you will get another choice of packs and a new points target. When you have got enough points you will get a new island available to which you can move.  Fail to meet the points target and its game over. Different building become available as you progress and the +/- minus scores from placing buildings near certain other buildings becomes more complex.

The aim, apart from having fun, is to achieve a high score. 

I have enjoyed the game so far and can see it has replay value as you will want to best your previous score and see what other building packs will become available to you and have you left enough room to place them.",True

"This game does not accurately represent previous Anno titles. However gives a fresh experience, many of us have been waiting for. Most Anno games in the past have just been the same thing over and over, with graphical updates, and set in a different Era. On previous versions there where many things to like, that were not put in this Anno. 

HOWEVER! That does not mean this (by any means) is a bad Anno experience. In fact, its a fantastic experience. Music is amazing, gameplay is very enjoyable, Story is much better then previous Anno games, and its overall just a great experience. A later DLC to add Skirmish is very likely, and when that fateful day arrives, the Anno fans of old, will get their fill. For now though, this game is great. 

Do not alter your opinion based on if its like the other Anno games. In alot of ways it is, and in alot of ways it is not. Never the less, the game is great as a whole, without compairing to the other Anno games. Don't let other opinions fool you, with judgements based on previous Anno games.",True

So two days ago i got on counter strike said there was a new update, i downloaded it got clicked competitive click the go button and it said you have to be level three to enter competitive so i sat there for five minutes thinking about what does it mean so i look at my rank i thought it was talking about that, then i looked below it and it said private level one so my reaction was WTF this game is turning in to call of duty so i said to my self '' that i'm not going to rank up three levels to play a pointless game ill play a different game'' i just want to know why would they do this but if you want to spend a lot of your time leveling up to private three to play competitive go ahead cause i don't have the time",True

It's got a lot of reasons for this:
At the first, I'd like to advice, that this game can be repeatable many times, because bigger part of game is randomized.
At the second, Slender man is very mysterious and horrible person, that can freak you on all 100%. This game can send you in the deeps of the ""rabbit and hunter"" role.
At the third, ""remake"" and new things. That game has got all things for everybody who's loving the first part, including ""the eight pages"", random, cool slender stuff, and sure... Pages. :D This game has got better graphics, and now it's not so annoying in graphics as other games.
And the last one is non-repeatable atmosphere. You will can't just sitting without emotions.

I regret it.

The original SS was frustrating in a goofy and fun sort of way. It was part of the charm.
The control scheme on the Vive, relying heavily on the side grips, is infuriating. And not in a fun sort of way. A simple improvement might be to simply make the side grip a toggle, allowing you to readily manipulate the index and thumb but easily keeping the other fingers out of the way.

"Firewatch is nothing more than a 5-hour experimental journey of how you, the player responds to struggle and conflict through a fictional world as its medium. Do not go into this expecting internal revelations or character development that will leave you speechless. It doesn't matter what dialogue option you choose, or how you complete objectives, it makes no impact. This game prides itself on your emotional relationship with the protagonist, Henry. 

Firewatch is a beautiful game that is worth playing if it drops on sale. While the gameplay itself is simple and asks very menial tasks of you. It soon carries you away on this path where you begin to question your own morals towards relationship and love. It’s quirky, cliché and heartbreaking and you will walk away wanting so much more. 

[b] ---{Graphics}--- [/b] 
This art style of this game is quite minimalistic and reminds me that of [b] Hinterland Studio’s; [i] The Long Dark [/i] [/b] (If you haven’t played that game, I highly recommend it). It has simple palettes, and the environment consists of blocked shapes and various sharp edges. However, through this simplistic art style the game manages to draw some breathtaking environments and atmospheres. 

[b] ---{Audio}--- [/b]
The atmospheric sounds and the music in this game is great when it is playing. There are unfortunately segments where you have environmental audio but there is nothing else to carry it. The broken structure of the music was something that threw me off in certain parts of this game. However, when the music did play, it completely carried you away.

If you look at Firewatch on the surface, there are many improvements that can be made. However, at its core, the choices and dialogue within this game is there for a purpose. It’s brutal and you may not like it, but it’s simply a reflection of ourselves when we are at our lowest.

There's nothing I can say that can sum up the pure joy and happiness this game has brought me in my darkest times. It mixes aspects of some of the best games out there in a heartfelt and meaningful way. The developer, a single man by the name of Eric Barone or ConcernedApe, crafted this game from pure passion and it shows.

If you're even considering buying this game, do it. I was skeptical during 2018's Summer Sale, and I went out on a limb and bought the game and it was an excellent choice. You will not regret the experience.

Just make sure your first play-through is genuine. Refrain from using the wiki or spoiling the gameplay. The best way to enjoy this game is from an ignorant perspective. Let the game teach you and you will appreciate it. You only get to experience your first farm once!",True

"Benoît Sokal's games have always been interesting and immersive with all around good writing and gameplay. While I wait for Syberia 3 I figured I would catch up on some of the ones I missed, Amerzone being one of them. It is a decent game with the story and journal style plot exposition that I love from his other games and it does give an insight into how Sokal has progressed over the years. The graphics are dated but from a game from 1999 I didn't expect anything different. The mechanics are basic and a little clunky, the puzzles are a little obtuse and I don't know if I will ever replay the game again but it was worth it from a completists point of view. If I had skipped over it I would always have wondered what it was like so I do reccomend it but I would say don't go in expecting a Syberia level experience.",True

"This game is absolutely wonderful. The visuals are obviously the main appeal of this game and the reason I wanted it in the first place, but the gamepay kept me coming back. I don't really play hard games that much. I never played Dark Souls, but if it is anywhere near as satisfying as Cuphead, I might have to try it. Cuphead walks the line between soulcrushingly hard and and painfully easy, making you want to constantly retry a boss because you just know you can beat him this time. Every time I died in Cuphead, it was my fault, with the exception of a few odd glitches. That is pretty much my only flaw with the game. Whenever you finally beat that boss you've been working on for the past 30 minutes, all the pain will have been worth the sheer satisfaction you get. Every boss so far is unique and charming. The boss designs are fantastic. The music, my GOD the music is amazing. 7 years of hard ass work resulted in a masterpiece. Best of luck to the devs. 10/10",True

"I enjoyed the game, even though the single-player campaign went pretty quick.  It is not very historically accurate as the U.S. Army at that time was segregated.  Why they felt the need to add an African-American into the squad is beyond me; I guess the developers are falling to the pressues of the times we live in.  Although this is a gap in historical reality, it did not take way from the game experience.  Overall, this is a game worth playing, in my opinion.",True

as a long time monster hunter (since Freedom Unite) Monster Hunter world is a super fun addition to the series.

"I have found this game to be simple, but very addicting. You cause destruction as one of several different cats, most of which you have to unlock through gameplay. 

You can play in two modes, objective mode and ""litterbox"" mode. Objective mode is where you are given a set of objectives to complete. You do this by knocking down or destroying the indicated items. You have a time limit in which to complete the objectives. You get bonuses for certain items, as indicated in your objectives.  If you complete your objectives, you get to move on to another level, up to four levels. There are special items you can knock down to unlock bonus levels which are added in to your four basic levels. 

""Litterbox"" mode is an untimed mode with no objectives. You get to take your time and explore. You get one point per item destroyed or knocked to the floor. 

You can level up your cat's abilities (Speed, Jump, Swipe) by finding upgrades. These consist of sparkling items that cats use or play with and by pawing at them, you can trigger an upgrade drop.  In objective mode, you have to decide whether or not you want to use your precious time to gather more upgrades while the clock is ticking. Sometimes it's worth it, sometimes it isn't, and you'll eventually start to figure that out.

There are collectibles and achievements, including secret achievements. I've played for over 17 hours and I still don't have everything.

It is reminiscent of Katamari Damacy. You are rushing around, causing chaos, knocking things down, and you have to get a certain number of items. It doesn't match up to Katamari in sheer variety of items and locales, or with an amazing soundtrack, but this is a much smaller scale game. It's still quite fun.

I haven't had much issue with the camera angle, and I'm pretty picky with that sort of thing. I've seen a few minor graphics glitches, but that's it. It feels fairly well polished.

I wish there was more variety in the soundtrack, but I can always turn down the music in the options and put on my own if I get tired of it.

I hope the developer releases more content for this game down the line. I'd be interested in it.",True

"One of my favorite rpg series. New game is somewhat 'smarter', enemies much intelligent than in previous games, crystals don't lie down like crap anymore, they are pretty scarce so you get most of them by destruction or in later stage you can buy them (no cheap solution though). Bottom line, you must consider really well which spells you will use often. 
 
Quests much more interesting, less of ‘go there bring me that’ and the plot is developing really nice.
The pet dragons are replaced by a single creature who can learn some nice tricks with time and teleports you anywhere you want, no need to run miles and miles to get to specific location.   So guys, this game is THE BEST of the previous ones, old good stuff polished and much new stuff to explore!

I definitely recommend this game to the fans of the King’s Bounty games and to all who like this kind of games.",True
"I bought this game during a Steam sale not expecting too much of it, but it's had me hooked for weeks now. It's fun to play and offers you a lot of things to do and ways to play. For instance, you can focus on the story, pirating, freelancing or trade goods that you either buy legally or gain by looting other ships. You can even specialize in mining asteroids and gasclouds and sell the gains. Or do all of the above!
The game gets updated regularly and now has a very extensive tutorial library to help new players get started. You're able to customize your ship's weapon loadout and, to a certain level, it's color and decals.
The only things I've noticed so far that could be improved is the voice acting in the storyline (which is pretty hilarious at times) and weapon impact effects. The latter look really poorly done compared to the sleek and smooth ship designs, explosions and absolutely beautiful galaxy you travel through.

"As a big fan of the old Wolfenstein I was hopeful for this one. After finally getting around to playing it I am not at all impressed. The story seems bland and overused, the first chapter is a horribad play through, and the game mechanics are kinda weird and clunky. Why have the ability to pickup a mini gun if you cant even take it with you through the next door? The dream levels are a cute callback to the original game, but quickly become annoying and repetitive. I have no idea how this game has very positive reviews. After the second chapter and ridiculous mechanics I couldn't take it anymore. Save yourself the trouble and don't bother with this game. Even if it comes as part of the bundle. From what I understand it isn't really that relevant to the overall story anyway. Pass.",False
See; I'm removing my review. Partially over the new TOS; as games like this can usher in beautiful and vast communities because of it's streaming potential. The second reason I've removed my original review is because of the current lack of accessible modding support. There are more detailed reviews but until this issue has been sorted out officially or through the community; this game isn't worth a dime. It's a great game but even before the ability for custom songs was removed; the recent updates have made this game significantly less fun to play. Performance is at an all time low; and that ruins a game like this. Don't buy it. Not yet.,False

"Sorry if this is anything I say is good is a common thing in bullet hell games, but this is my first bullet hell game. This game is great. Though, I wouldn't buy it at full price. Like one of the reviews I saw when I was deciding if I'd even buy this game, I think the devs don't know how to properly increase the difficulty of the game as you progress through it. The last two bosses for whatever reason are ridiculously harder than any of the other bosses in the game. But if you don't mind the ridiculous spike in difficulty, it's not bad. I've never really played any bulltet hell games, but this one was pretty fun. My only issues with the game was how obnoxiously loud the sound effects audio was, the weird naming for keys, and that most of the dialogue is done in combat. The loud sound effects can be fixed with a simple bit of tweaking, but it seriously drowns out the rest of the audio if you don't set it up right. As for weird naming for the keys, I'd say just look at it yourself or try finding one of the community guides that show you a diagram of keys that can be used in game. Anyway, I'd say use a controller to play. Also when backing out of any of the settings menus do NOT press Esc. That will exit the game. I can't tell you how many times that happened with me. As for the dialogue during combat, you can do one of three things. Learn Japanese, try to read the subtitles while dodging missiles and whatnot, or record your gameplay and watch it later. YouTube works as well. Aside from these negatives, the positives are that combat feels pretty good, the story is not bad for an indie game, and the game is very stable. There are some random frame drops, but nothing really bad. They usually happen at the end of a boss fight when the boss is defeated. Not sure why it mostly happens there, but it does. In combat, your sword is your best friend when it comes to damage, but kills with it will lower your score multiplier if you're interested in getting a high score. The Lucis or whatever they call it is your ranged attack and is your best friend when it comes to keep up your score multiplier. It has two firing modes. Focus Shot and Scatter Shot. Holding down your button for Focus shot will place a narrow cone in the direction you're facing or pointing to. Anything within that cone will be locked onto by the Lucis for a short time. The more Lucis you have locked on to enemies the less you'll have to shoot any incoming projectiles during the very brief cool down your sword goes through when performing a combo. Scatter Shot also has a lock on feature when its button is held down, but it locks on to enemies within a short range and takes longer to lock on. Your last type of a attack is the EX Attack. It can only be used when the yellow gauge above your health gauge is full. It has three different versions that can be used, but I'll let you figure that out how to use them on your own since two of them can only be launched during a specific situation and all three use the same button to activate. However all three versions offer you one thing besides wiping out enemies or doing massive damage to bosses. Temporary invicibility. Your sword can also do this with the dash attack (hold down sword button), but has a short cooldown phase that leaves you vunerable when the invicibility is gone. Anyway, with these weapons and abilities, the game is fun. You feel powerful, but not op. If anything, I'd say you're alot like a glass cannon, but you don't die very fast unless you get really careless. That concludes what I have to say about this game. It's great, but it's gots some quirks. I wouldn't recommend this at full price, but if you can get it on sale, it is totally worth it.

*Update*
I know that my review of this game is already pretty lengthy, so I'll keep it short. The improvements made in the Definitive Edition are certainly good. However one problem I do have is the buggy music audio. It doesn't go silent, but instead will make a loud buzzing sound from time to time. Sometimes it'll get so bad that it literally stays like that until you close the game completely and start it up again. Buggy audio aside, some of the fights, including boss fights, have been altered. Not all, but there are a couple. The tutorial they added was also good. Though I wish it were in the game before. Also the game no longer refers to individual keys as Button (insert random number). They're labed as actual keys. Same for controller buttons. As for arrange mode, I wouldn't try that unless you were a complete novice at playing bullet hell or shoot'em ups. The game mode makes combat way too easy. If you want a challenge, stick to original mode. Aside from any of the changes I've mentioned before, original mode is pretty much the same base experience as before the release of Definitive Edition. There is an extra cutscene at the beginnig, but that's it. And like before, don't buy this game at full price. That $5 price increase is not worth what was added. That audio bug I encountered is also just another reason to get this game on sale.",True

"I've been a fan of Tecmo for years.Today's evaluation is just a whim. I've been following Tecmo since the NINJA RYUKENDEN series. And now I like the DEAD OR ALIVE series best. 
I liked Marie very much if Tamaki don't come out. For I had played DOA6  on the PS4, so I bought the steam version later. I think DOA6 and DOA5 have their own merits. Personally, I prefer the models in 6 and the combat system in 5. The four Season Pass were bought at the original price immediately cuz I am crazy about collecting all the clothes in a game. Just as most of us bought the last DLC bundle, the official news came that the game was about to stop permanently. What a pity!

"$ PRICE / QUALITY

☑ not worth it 
☐ acceptable 
☐ absolutely worth

Explination: $30 dollars for a game that lags harder than ricer stuck in snow? Not worth it at all. Avoid until issues are settled. Not to forget that the developer took forever to deal with the hacker issues, and they still have these problems. 

ϟ REQUIREMENTS

☐ Mac
☐ potato PC
☐ minimum
☑ medium
☐ high end
☐ NASA computer

Explination: This game can be run on computers and laptops that have a decent GPU. Probably to render a lot more than it has to but whatever. A GTX 1050 Ti will still have to chug along just to play normally. 

Ⓞ GRAPHICS

☐ Glowing missing textures are preferable to stare at
☐ wear glasses to protect your eyes
☐ bad
☑ OK
☐ good
☐ eye candy (low to medium)
☐ masterpiece (high and up)

Explination: ARMA 3 tier graphics but the performance like you're trying to play GTA V ENB enchancer on a low end computer. Meh.

ⓘ GAME TIME

☐ download took longer
☐ short
☐ few hours
☐ plenty of hours
☐ long
☐ Fallout New Vegas with mods
☑ endless  

Explination: It's a multiplayer shooter. It ends when the players deciede to quit. 

✎ STORY

☑ it doesnt have
☐ the Last Jedi tier
☐ still better than Twilight
☐ semi-decent
☐ good
☐ fantastic

Explination: There isn't a story. It comes down to ""aim and shoot"" after landing somewhere and grabbing some loot. 

😮 ENDING

☑ what ending?
☐ ME3 tier
☐ limping along but got done
☐ sums up good
☐ fantastic conclusion
☐ game's so good it didn't need one

Explination: It's a multiplayer game. It doesn't have one.

☠ DIFFICULTY
☐ I should be insulted
☐ easy
☐ medium
☑ easy to learn, hard to master
☐ hard
☐ dark souls
☐☑ it exists to spite you 

Explination: PUBG is pretty straightforward. More or less point and shoot while compensating for recoil. Well that's assuming that you're not shredded before the other person kills you. Or you suffer at the hands of server lag.

☼ BUGS

☐ worse than a bug eaten rotten tree
☑ termite infestation
☐ baseball field ant mound (mods)
☐ few bugs (no mods)
☐ nothing

Explination: PUBG is probably one of the most laggiest games one can play. It performs like butt in CQC and okish at long distance combat. Random car flippings, lagging through the floor, vehicle spazzing out, getting stuck on objects you aren't even colliding with, shots not even matching up with your target.

"My first ever review, so be kind :D

This game is everything Banished should have been. And before anyone complains, i am a huge fan of Banished, i just think that this game is a step up from Banished.

The graphics are beautiful. Buildings, people, wildlife, livestock all look great, very detailed.

The game is easy to learn, but for complete beginners i think the tutorial needs a bit of work.

I haven't come across any bugs or crashes yet, i've only been playing for 3 hours.

The fact you can possess the body of a villager and take full control of them is great! You see through their eyes in first person view. You can take supplies to the warehouse, or kill a wolf that's eating your chickens!! Or just take a walk around the village you created.

I like the fact that the weather has a huge impact on what crops you can grow, and how they grow. How the weather affects your villagers and their performance when doing their jobs.
The fact that even when you make clothing for your villagers they actually change their clothing, so it alters the look of them. 

The game makes the micromanagement of your villagers important. How your villagers feel and act has an impact on your entire village and it's productivity.

My only negative so far is the fact i can't use edge scrolling with the mouse. I hate using keys to move left or right in game. And the camera control needs calming down a little as it's super fast. But these are minor things that can be fixed as the game progresses.

The fact is, this is a Banished style game with everything Banished didn't include. It's fully working in Early Access, and it looks stunning.

Well worth getting if you like Banished, or if you're looking for a new city builder type game that isn't too easy or so simple it's built and finished in 5 minutes.

For anyone worrying about specs, here's mine, and the game runs perfectly :)

"This is a very well made and fun first person shooter with some RPG elements. This is not a good or well made Fallout game. Just because it kind of looks like Fallout doesn't mean that it is. The crafting system is a great idea executed poorly. Just because it's there doesn't mean I want it shoved down my throat. Much like the fact that there are barely any weapons in the game because of this gimic. Basically after about 3 hours of gameplay you've seen almost every weapon in the game. Oh, there's legendary weapons you say? Yeah, they're the same thing you've been seeing already but with different stats, nothing special move along. Apparently they've decided to streamline the game so much to appeal to fresh players that they've completely forgot what made Fallout 3 special. And seriously, why did you leave out the Lincoln rifle? 

The graphics are good enough, I have no complaints about them.
The optimization tho? It's horrendous.

The following is very easy for me to say and not at all biased.  Honest!

Total Annihilation.  A mandatory experience for any accomplished RTS enthusiast (seriously).  A Mega-tactical WTF, and absolutely way ahead of its time.  It recreated a whole new standard and ushered a new era of hardcore RTS gaming.  It maintains that standard to this day and can hold its head high.

"As you can see i only played 45min so far and i uninstalled the game for the moment,i have cms2015 and loved it,i used to be a mechanic myself for 10years,so these are the games for me but this game isn't there yet,for starters you can only play proper on a qwerty keyboard,i have azerty wich sucks,the second thing,i'm stuck in tutorial mode,i can't take jobs,note that this could be my fault and haven't played that much:-) 3th thing they need to fix the engine stand it bugs me alot that the engine stand is wrapped around the crankshaft wich isn't realistic and anoying because it hinders the view when trying to remove the con-rods from the crankshaft,in real life you attach the engine to the engine stand with 4 arms to the holes where the gearbox screws in.
Compairing cms2015 to cms2018,in cms2018 the graphics are way nicer and the parts look more realistic and there are a lot more features in the game like tire changes etc.. i gave the game a tumbs up because if it works proper some day this will be one of the best simulators around.I can garantee you that but be patient,the devs are working hard and they have my full support on this, and for the ones who rant bad things about this game, download a program called BLENDER and try to create something and studie some C++ coding then come back and write a review you will have a lot more respect for people who create videogames,i know i have.",True

Awesome game with interesting idea. It looks attractive and the music is not bad. I liked it a lot,True
"A bit on the fence on this one. While it's well worth the money for time spent, it seems to suffer from some of the same late-game flaws many other games in the ARPG genre share. Mainly the fact that even melee classes will be forced into some type of kiting strategy in replays with increasing difficulty to avoid one-shot insta-deaths. This is probably more a criticism of the genre as a whole as most ARPGs I have played seem to have this issue. I still give it a positive review because the game overall was very fun with some nice additions to keep it unique from the rest of the genre.",True

"[b]Undertale[/b] is a game that makes you care.

From the beginning, it starts off with a rather simple premise. The retro-looking graphics helps to sell that premise, letting the casual person to look at it and assume the story it offers is just as simple. And it is... at first.

The main 'schtick' of the game being 'an RPG where you don't have to destroy anyone' made me ponder for a moment [i]why[/i] it's even a gimmick in the first place. RPGs are those games where you kill monsters, get gold and xp, become stronger and save the world, right? Admit it, it's what most people think of when they hear 'RPG', and I wasn't any different.

What marks [b]Undertale[/b] as an RPG is that it doesn't diverge from that aspect at all, but instead adds something else. You can, if you truly desire to, kill monsters, get gold and xp, and so on. Obviously the monsters won't enjoy it when you do that to their friends and the story you create changes. Choices matter, and the game will remember what you do, what you don't do, and can be rather startling on how it reminds you of your past decisions.

The characters of [b]Undertale[/b] is where the game can make or break it for you. The game tries to instill some compassion for them and make you care for them. Now, I know it sounds bad for some, but it's not overly clumsy or heavy-handed in its approach. It does its best to make you smile. Or cry. Or both, if you're a big softy like me.

The monsters are diverse, funny, quirky, and so on (having drawn a large amount of inspiration from games like Earthbound) ranging from the meek and not-very-terrifying Whimsun to some rather violent and scary monsters. The battle mechanics are just as diverse, requiring good reflexes and judgement. Battle is turn-based, and you have to dodge attacks like a bullet-hell game... most of the time. Depending on the monster, the rules of the battle can change.

[b]Undertale[/b] sometimes breaks the fourth wall, but it does so tastefully. The plot actually revolves around the fact that Undertale [i]is a game[/i], and it benefits greatly from not shying away from this fact. After all, this game does quite a bit to change your expectations of what to expect from this 'RPG'.

[u]I recommend this game for anyone:[/u]
Who likes 8-bit games with pretty cool music
Who likes diverse, funny NPCs and monsters, and possibly having unexpected feels for them
Who likes having their expectations suddenly subverted in surprising ways
Who likes dodging, platforming, solving puzzles
Who likes being a soft-hearted saint or a cold-blooded murderer... or something in between

Having an appreciation for anime, bad puns, annoying dogs, spiders, skeletons, yelling for emphasis, ghosts, robots, and making friends would be nice, but not necessary. Also, strongly resist any urge to look up a guide until after your first playthrough. Spoilers would wreck a great deal of the experience this game has to offer.

Probably shouldn't let small children play it, though; I'd say kids 13+ wouldn't have a problem playing through it. It's not an overly-long game; a couple of hours and you'd be done unless you're scouring the game for secrets or something. Undertale has quite a few secrets as well, so take some time to smell the flowers.

There's a demo for the game (so you can try before you buy) as well as several YouTubers already having done playthroughs of the game. I'd recommend searching for 'StephenPlays First 20' of Undertale if you'd rather watch someone play the demo without too many spoilers, instead of playing it yourself.",True
"Very good game, retro or not.  Runs on potatoes. Really wish this had come to the 3DS eShop.",True
"Oooook. ATLAS... yep, despite the negative reviews and terrible launch day, I decided to have a go at it. And honestly, though still incredibly buggy and in need of some major TLC, it's not a terrible game. Unfinished and unpolished, but decent for that. At the time of this review, the game was on sale for 25 bucks. doesen't feel completely wasted. At this time, I'm considering the game to be a sort of investment into a better project down the road.

Gameplay wise, it's Ark. No getting around that fact unfortunately. Which isn't a bad thing. Many things familiar to Ark players can easily be found here, which can help ease old Ark players in with familiarity. However, there are things unique to Atlas, such as a leveling system and the ability to dig for water, to name a couple. Wheather or not the developers will do more to distinguish this game from Ark, remains to be seen.

However, there are some gripes I do have. Firstly, I can't seem to locate or they didn't include the option for single player play at the time of this review. Also, the servers seem to be messed up at the time as I spent most of my time in combat with teleporting animals. Another thing I wasn't a fan of was the fact that I began my adventure in the middle of the ocean on an island without so much as a boat or clothes. While challenging, this is praised as a pirate adventure. I don't want to spend my first hours messing around an island. I want to be exploring the land around me and enjoying the freedom of the ocean. Though this is more a personal gripe than anything else.

Overall, is it perfect? Nope. Noooot by a long shot so far. Needs alot of work. But I'm willing to give a positive just because the concept is good, the gameplay is familiar and still easy to learn, and I want to see where this game goes. Hopefully it will become something awesome given time.",True

"I'm writing this in an ""in-process"" manner, as I've only recently unlocked True Vault Hunter Mode on my first character. I found the game to be...well...not very good, to be frank. While the writing got better near the end, for most of the game I really didn't give a damn about what was going on. It didn't help that it's technically a narrated tale told by [Character Omitted] when I wasn't even playing as [pronoun]. At least in Dragon Age II, Varric was telling the story because he was actually freakin' there, you know? 

Since I didn't care about the story, I only had the gameplay to go on, and it was ultimately lacking. ""Same shit, different day"" for a lot of it, but now we don't even have the Eridium weapons I learned to enjoy in 2. Of course, this is a prequel to 2, so instead we get...lasers? Sure, they're cool and very handy, but come on. You're introducing a ""new"" weapon, and yet it suddenly vanished in the time between TPS and 2. Gimme a damn break. 

Like many have ranted about, the ""new mechanics"" of the game - ""Oz"" and low gravity - really didn't do much for the atmosphere. If anything, the jump mechanics were often frustrating and imprecise to control. Home run there. @_@ Another fun part was going through the same four or five zones over and over and over, because we all love doing that, after all. Yaaaaaawn. 

In general, the game is pretty damn boring and doesn't really bring anything new or fascinating to the franchise. If you want to know why Handsome Jack turned in to the villain, sure, it's Ok to watch a playthrough on YouTube. Unless you're a die-hard Borderlands fan with rosey glasses, however, steer away from playing it yourself. Stick to 2.",False

"Tyranny is a very interesting game, which gets stuck on it's complex mechanisms and abrupt ending. Game has a lot of replay value, which expands it's lifetime in library.

[h1]Character[/h1]
Known world has fallen under evil overlord [b]Kyros[/b]. Her Archon of Justice [b]Tunon[/b] acts as her judge. You are one of Tunon's Fatebinders, acting as his eyes and hands during the ongoing conquest of Tiers. Setup is far from traditional and gives very interesting concept for the game.

Character creation is simple and straightforward enough. Skills and attributes are easy to understand. However, this simplicity does not carry over in to gameplay itself, where mechanics are more complex than character creation allows player to understand. 

This is where problems with the game begin. Vast number of different values will make the game feel incoherent at first. Player learns to understand the mechanics over the gameplay, but they are not always self-explanatory and understanding some of them might take more time. In this regard Obsidian could have followed the golden rule of ""Kill Your Darlings"" and make the system slightly less complex for new player to understand. 

While vast number of different mechanisms can feel taunting at first, these do add to replay value of the game. You can plan and build your own character and even companions around minor mechanisms in game, which you might have completely ignored during the first playthrough.

Skill system is simple and progression coherent. All skills will grow over use. This is true for your NPC companions as well. You do not need to worry too much about base success change. You usually end up succeeding what you were trying to do in offense, so higher combat skill values end up affect to rate of your critical hits and related special effects. Defense values are a bigger deal. Attack success are counted as skill vs skill - such as One-handed vs. Parry - and it is well advised to pay attention to defensive skills and talents. Of course your attack values are important as well, but enemies seem to place more value for various damage resistances than high defensive skills.

Skill values are affected by character attributes. Player gets 1 Attribute point and 1 Talent point to distribute over each level up. Adding 1 attribute point to relevant skill can cause skill level to rise 1-3 points (x1.5 main, 0.5 secondary attribute affecting the skill.) Player can use trainer services in the game to advance their character skills. They can also advance NPC follower skills like this.

[h1]Combat and magic[/h1]
Fighting against different enemies can be very rewarding, due to their various resistances. Game UI is lenient enough to allow player to see them, which allows selecting correct spells and skills against different enemies. Attackers in groups might have various resistances. It is not always said that your team will encounter them properly prepared for that exact combat. This forces spellcaster characters to expand their casting repertoire. This can be done without loosing the sight of their specializations.

Various resistances, talents and classes in encountered teams make each battle to feel like a small victory. Player rarely just walks over enemy groups. Game also has proper reasons for scaling enemies. Certainly inexperienced recruits in their first battle early in the game were easier enemies than experienced elite forces of various rulers later in the game. Tyranny does not give a feeling of artificial scaling of enemies. You will just encounter harder targets, because they should be so. Encounters are well balanced and might force your team to retreat and return later, if you really were not up to face enemies you ran in to.

As mentioned above, you usually end up succeeding in your offense. This does not mean it would take any proper effect. Heavy armors and high resistances can cause even a massive damage getting reduced just as 1 point of damage. Magic, accessories and artifact are playing a big role in combat, when you are trying to overcome enemies, before they overcome you.

Spellcrafting is quite fun and necessary. You can expand spellcasting abilities a lot by getting familiar with new runes you find during the game. Unfortunately some of the runes are locked so far in to endgame that players do not have adequate time to get used to them. It would have been better to expand single rune usability over spellcasting skill progress, compared to locking them away for so long. Of course, that would have made skill trainer system vastly overpowered in the game. Obsidian could have paid a bit more time to work with this aspect of the game.

Spellcrafting suffers from the lack of spellbook for already crafted spells. This makes redoing team spells unnecessarily complex. You hardly want to fight against a swarm of [b]Bane[/b] with same spells you used to fight with a group of [b]Bronze Brotherhood[/b] mercenaries.

[h1]World and storyline[/h1]
World or Tyranny is brutal. There are not many ""good"" choices you can make. Each line will require decisions, which will hurt innocents either immediately or in the long run. 

Story is divided between three acts. Act I and II are core gameplay acts, where Act III is more about tying loose knots and finishing your decisions. Sadly, Act III is where the game runs out of time and prevents you from actually enjoying your progress. 

Acts I and II promise a lot for Act III, but final act is a needlessly short experience, which ends the game far sooner than expected. Obsidian could have dragged the final act longer and allow players to enjoy - or suffer - from consequences of their decisions. Some major decisions in the game are constantly being presented, but actions during Act II are barely revisited in Act III, where they should have had far more consequences in the world. You might have done something noble, or absolutely atrocious during the gameplay. None of this is really reflected in Act III and so your actions loose their meaning.

Fighting your way in to Act III is very satisfying. It is quite sad that this satisfaction is not properly reflected in the game, though it is visited in ending screens. 

[h1]Summary[/h1]
Tyranny has an interesting concept, which requires new thinking. This extends to both gameplay and correspondence between you and NPCs in the game. 

Lore of the world is astoundingly vast. Too vast for the game of this size. Tyranny called for a longer playing experience, or second game where your choices could be imported. As a standalone game, it fell short on grand promise it gives and stops with a unnecessarily abrupt ending.

Game has quite a lot mechanisms in place. Some of them feel unnecessary for the experience, at least for the first playthrough. They do add to game though and also it's replayability value. Vast amount of different choices in the game will leave players curious about other paths they could have taken, though that still does not justify shortcomings of final Act III, which should have been the climax of the game.

Tyranny stands as a good example of what creative team can do and grants relatively satisfying experience. It also stands as a bad example of how development team looses it's sight of the gameplay experience, justifying sudden end with replayability value.

Like the Fatebinder, Tyranny does leve it's mark on the world in both good and bad. It gives almost solid gameplay experience and acts as excellent break between other games you might be playing.

I have to raise my hat to Obsidian's creative writing team for all the lore they added in to this world. I hope to see the world of Tyranny to continue. Even with poorly made ending and apparently less satisfying number of sold copies, world of Tyranny is made too well to be forgotten. It is my honest wish that Obsidian and Paradox would visit the game world with a new game, with better understanding of experience they want to give in the end.",True

"Game can be considered completed at around 30 Hours just before the ""Final"" Stage.  

The game still retains most of the same controls and gameplay from previous Dirt series except for the ability to ""rewind"" on all modes. There are 3 types of modes, 2 of which are just different forms of racing in Gravel with Trucks or in an actual Sports car in Asphalt. The other mode is Rally which is from their new series Dirt Rally.

Though the RALLY mode is just 1 it is split into 2 sub-modes, 1 for newer cars and other for older cars so majority of the game is spent in Rally. They didnt include the Gymkhana from 3 or even the Dirt Rally of racing with other cars from 2 and 3.

This is where the problem starts.  Rally this time is sticking with the real world of only you and your co-driver\pilot in the track. There are no other opponents you actually encounter in the tracks.  Each track now feels empty and it even feels emptier to additional causes like there are technically just a few tracks with LOTS of reused assets. Most tracks use the same Trees, roads, towns and any other assets they can use. 

There are  times in previous Dirt games where i am playing that i am admiring the City or view from what i can see. I had NO such experience in this game. The feeling of emptiness and grindiness is weighing on me when playing Rally tracks since there are no AI to change the course even just a bit.  

The main reason why i stopped just before the final stage(And why only %5 of people has this achievement) is because after you complete the ""final"" stage for each mode the FINAL mode unlocked is basically the same races AGAIN but longer. I'm like WHAT!?!?

Pros
- Still retained the controls and feel of Dirt prequels
- Rally is nice(IF ONLY THEY ADDED IT AND NOT MADE IT THE MAJORITY OF THE GAME)
-Weather effects add some sense of realistic challenges

Cons
-Reused asssets for all tracks and stages
-No AI for majority of the stages makes it feel empty
-Removal of Rewind function
-Other modes with AI are too few
- Again REUSED ASSETS FOR ALL STAGES

NOTE: It is still a ""ok"" game if you like Dirt series BUT this is possibly the longest game i played that I am giving a negative review due to the fact that compared to their OLDER games (even the cheap spinoff game SHowdown) is way more fun to play.",False

"[i]TL;DR: This game is good. Buy if you have a friend that you can play along with or if you don't care to progress slowly unless you pour some time in the game. Otherwise, this is a masterpiece of modern times, art-wise and gameplay-wise.[/i]

I must say that when i saw the anoucement trailer a few years back, this game caught my attention immediatly. Not only because of the aestethic, but the frenetic pacing that the gameplay shown had. This was one of the games that i kept repeating in my head ""please, don't be shit"". Now that it was released, i'm relived that my prayers were heard. I will refrain from talking about the art or music direction, because it has all the praise it really deserves. Just look at it. Even if you don't like this art style, you must admit the game looks INCREDIBLE.

[h1]GENERAL[/h1]
So, about the gameplay? Really good, if you like a challenging platformer. You can shoot in most directions, but that doesn't mean you can just fire aimlessly. You still need to time and aim shots well enough to kill the smaller minions or to chunk the bigger enemies and bosses, even with close-range weapons.

It is unfair to compare this game to Dark Souls [b](Just because it is hard, it doesn't mean it is like Dark Souls, goddamnit)[/b]. I think it is better to call this a refined version of Contra, from the NES. In Contra you run, aim, and shoot, while dodging the enemy fire and getting new weapons. Cuphead has this exact formula, but adds in a Dash, so that you can dodge attacks faster [i](which means enemies will shoot you relentlessly, because hell, you have a dodge button)[/i] and a mid-air parry that grants you a power-shot every time you hit a bright-pink enemy projectile [i](which also means enemies will shoot you more accuratly, because hell, you can bash some shots to oblivion)[/i]. It becomes incredible the amount of stuff flying on the screen that you have to dodge, but, with enough trial and error, you get to do in a snap of the fingers.

Cuphead is made mostly of boss stages, that you need to hit constantly to whittle them down slowly, and the only hint that they are taking damege is the feint glow after every sucessful shot, and the transition to a new stage of the fight. To make the boss hunting a little easier, you can get new weapons and upgrades from the shop, with the coins you collect in the few 'run n gun' stages, that have 5 coins each. Choose your power-us wisely, because you only have few coins to spend.
[i][EDIT]Found out that there are coins to be found on the world map. Think of them as quests from rpgs, without having to grind for items. Still, some are cryptic and you still need to pick your items wisely.[/i]

[h1]Perfection? Not quite.[/h1]
Ok, i praised the game a lot, now lets get to the bad stuff. Not bad as in gamebreaking, but as in ""It could have been better"". Mind you that i criticise this game after beating it once, mostly single player, and loving every second of those 17 hours:

-Starting off, why in the name of guacamole you can [b]ONLY[/b] parry mid-air? I get that you are jumping most of the time, but having to use it as a double tap of the jump button is just odd. Even if the game has platforming challenges built around this particular aspect, i still can't think of a reason to not have a ground parry, even if a delayed one.

-I thought that the lack of a hard mode to challenge the most skilled or avid players being a negative, but the game already has a hard mode. Play it alone. The idea of having a game built for 2 players isn't new, but it feels somewhat incomplete not having a partner all the time, either to save your hide or to whittle the boss faster. It feels like you are trying to drive a car with a flat tire - Technically you can, but it is dangerous and you feel wierd all the time.
[i][EDIT] I found out that the game DOES have a hard mode, it just unlocks after you beat the game once. AND is hard as balls in some cases, but not all. The bosses have the same amount of transformations, just with extra crap flying all over the screen or with less platforms. Even with that in mind, playing alone still feels like a extra handicap.[/i]

-I have a small gripe with the weapons and upgrades. It adapts to the players personal style of playing this type of game, selecting up to two weapons, a power up and one of three Supers. Sounds simple and awesome, but i cannot brush off the feeling that it is somewhat broken. Broken meaning that i used the exact same combo of weapons and powers in almost every non-aerieal boss, including the last one. Peashooter (the standard weapon, mind you), Seeker Shot and Smoke Bomb, that grants a brief (but extremely helpful) moment of invulnerability. Every time i tried a new combination (Spread shot, extra life with less damege, automatic parry), i just felt weaker, even after a lot of tries. I missed the safety of the Smoke Bomb, or the practicity of not having to aim a lot using the Seeker Shot. I hope thats just me.
[i][EDIT] Just to further explain my complaints: the Smoke Bomb is just WAY better than every other augment, just because it saves you from being hit. Why bother having extra hit points to brush off getting hit when you can [b]dash through shots and not get hit at all?[/b] Also, the first super has both the effects of the other 2 supers. It gives the moment of invulnerability of the second one (granted, you are locked in place untill the animation is over, but still can't be dameged) and has the damege potential of the third one, on a bigger area.[/i]

-This game has a lot of trial and error. The boss fights last only about 1~3 minutes, but you die A LOT, sobe prepared to spend some time on every boss, learning its patterns and planning a strategy. I dont think trial and error is a bad thing; it is just a tool of learning and incentiveses you to keep going, knowing that every time you get closer to the end, but don't think you'll just ""kill this boss on the first try and move on"".

-[u][SPOILERS][/u] One last thing that is not gamebreaking, but might be a bug: In the first stage of the last boss, The Devil, when he uses his head-snake attack, one of the ways to dodge the attack is to run to the opposite side of the room. When he retreats his head, the tongue animation is a little bit off of the hitbox, so when you leave your safety cover you end up getting hit when he  clearly has already retreated.

[h1]FINAL THOUGHTS[/h1]
It may feel that i am criticizing the game a lot, but only because it is easier to list the few bad things i found out about the game than the mountain of praises i can give. Heck, i even sprinkled some fair points and praises in my criticism. Be the beautiful and talented art direction, that captures the magic of a long-gone era of animation, or the fantastic action-packed gameplay, this is the kind of game that just does not age. Simple, effective and just good.",True

"This game requires less explanation than many others.  Look at the trailer, and see if it looks appealing to you.  If it does, I guarantee it's every bit as good as it looks and then many times better.  For what this game is- for it's core formula- it's literally perfect.  This game will have you sweating and panting.  I lost track of how many times my jaw *literally* dropped after an extremely rhythmic series of notes has been pressed.  The environment is one of the trippiest I've ever seen in any game, and that's an awesome thing.  This game is like if you mixed ""BIT TRIP RUNNER"" with guitar hero, and then made the resulting mixture 10 times better.  The way the setpieces blend seamlessly with your actions, and the way your actions blend seamlessly with the game's rhythm, is phenomenal.  This game is incredibly ""crunchy-"" your movements feel hyper-responsive and extremely ""physical"" as many reviewers have put it.  Seriously, buy this game pronto- I can promise you'll love it.",True

"I could go on and on about the hyper-realistic, partial based goat simulating physics.  I could speak endlessly on the 1 to 1, next-gen of next-gen design.  Goat simulations so realistic you will feel compelled to eat every other goat simulator you own, and then post the resulting fecal deposits on Facebook.
But no….what I want to touch on is the expert story.
A touching plot that starts simple, as most do, but ends in such a tear jerking plot twist that you will go watch Lassie to calm down.  A tale so well woven than I actually forgot I was not a goat.  Sure my wife left me and all my furniture has bite marks in it, but that is the price.
Without giving too much away it is the story of a goat in a small town.  Yes, it starts with the same story you have seen hundreds of times before in every pathetic goat game of the past.  Soon though you are thrust into a “Game of Thrones” like struggle for the crown and the undying acceptance from your peers.  Life and Death seem to swirl around the goat until he meet the love of his life only to find our SHE IS A RO….

"Well, what can i say?
I'm suprised. I've started from Skyrim - Oblivion - Now Morrowind.
I finally decided to buy Morrowind, and so far the experience was pretty decent, i dont dislike the graphics like many people say, because the lore, content matter more, and if you have a decent PC, install Graphics Overhaul. it will look like Oblivion, or even better.

This Elder Scrolls serie, is the most addicted edition, you need to run miles to reach your objetives, you need to read everything to understand what you need, is more survival than the other Elder Scrolls titles.

The lands are so beautiful, and make you feel excited to explore them.

The game is a ' true ' RPG, the magic... oh... magic in this game, is the biggest part, you can be whatever you want.

The soundtrack, makes the player feel so confortable, while playing the game... every elder scrolls lover or fan, must try this game, such a piece of art... this review, was based on my hours, i m on the beginning, gonna update later!

And I loved this game...when it first came out. And to be honest, I still do love it.

The difficulty curve, as of recent patches, is just crazy now, and skill wont offset it. YOu just have to hope for good rolls of the dice. And thats fine, if the grind to breed heroes wasnt so great. That alone, as well as the fact that there isn't a way to 'loose'. 

At least XCOM difficulty scaled. At least you could prepare for losses and it felt urned. At least you could actually loose the game and know you were crushed. Darkest Dungeon? It just waits for you to stop playing it.

"Overall:
A blend of JRPG mechanics and WRPG presentation. It really feels like playing through a highlights package of all the series funniest moments. The focus is on the weird and wacky stuff from the show's long run, rather than anything political or topical. The game is short (approx 10 hours) and not particularly challenging, but lots of fun while it lasts. Worth buying at full price for long-time fans of the show who have been watching it since the 90s, teenage/college age gamers might be better off waiting for a sale.

Incidentally, as an Australian, I played the censored version. I'm of the opinion that Matt & Trey's open contempt for the Australian Classification Board is actually funnier than the scenes that were censored.

Pros:
* Amazing presentation - indistinguishable from the cartoons
* Genuinely funny humor
* Fun gameplay in first half of game - wide variety of viable combat tactics
* Flexible class system - Classes give unique abilities, but don't constrain your playstyle
* Huge amount of hidden content and references from the series
* Very stable for an Obsidian game - bugs are relatively minor, only encountered a game-stopping bug once (reloaded, bug did not re-occur).

Cons:

* Checkpoint based saves take 90s Nostalgia a bit too far
* Armor scaling issues and widespread immunity to status effects in the late game restrict viable combat tactics
* Keyboard layout not adjustable or even visible - bothersome if you forget which keys did what
* [spoiler]Zombies.[/spoiler] The second half of the game mostly consists of [spoiler]zombies[/spoiler] and they're everything bad about videogame [spoiler]zombies.[/spoiler] Using ""spoilers"" to hide a radical gameplay shift and resultant dip in overall quality isn't an ethical move.",True

"8/10 probably my game of the year!
Been a diehard Soulcalibur fan since SC2. Graphically, this game runs beautifully, looks gorgeous, and is extremely detailed. Gameplay wise it is much faster compared to prior entries in the franchise, only slowed by the new, ""Reversal Edge,"" system. Also to call the character creator entertaining is an understatement, (compared to prior entries it is a little bare, I do believe it will be fixed with the DLC.) SC6 also undoes the awful story SC5 left us on, (it's much more engaging.) This is definitely a game I can very happily recommend to new players, and old! Update: they're adding 2B so that's rad!

Pros:
Very fun gameplay
Easy to pick up & hard to master
Beautiful graphics & soundtrack
EXTREMELY fun character creator
Lots of characters
Good for both multiplayer and singleplayer experiences

Cons:
Character built into game is locked behind DLC
Reversal Edge system can slow things down
Character creator has fewer customization options compared to prior games
English voice acting can be very cheesy
Story mode can be a little too wordy (minimal complaint)",True

You constantly get agro from creatures for no reason wolfs are a peast that constnatly murder everything. The grind to get a nice ship is mental taking hundreds of thousands of mats to complete, and the ghost ships will just murder your ship so good job spending time grinding for the mats try again. Bugs have killed ships sometime as well so another thing to constantly be fighting against. Plays exactly like ARK, and will be UNMODABLE due to how they have the servers setup. There is a massive overspawning issues, and you can't even attempt to play on the public servers as ever single island imaginable has been taken over and covered by either one faction as there is no limit on how many areas a guild can have so hey wanna take over a island so nobody else can play the game?

"This game is amazing, Apart from some bugs it is the kinda game that zombie game lovers may not like and this is because of the way that PVP is made. Most people do kill each other and do not even talk because it is way more easy to just shoot then grab their gear. The game needs to have an aspect that will make some players cringe away from being bandits and also, It has  become a regular thing where when an update is posted there are SO MANY errors that stop you from playing. Be warned, This game is slow paced and if you are the kinda guy to start crying when you loose lots of gear then do not buy this game. The map is huge but sadly is the same map from Arma 2 so players of that game and Mod will be put back in the same place but with some added towns/citys. Overall if you like a slow paced PVP suvival game and you know you will die from players and from bull then buy the game, BUT! know the game is in Alpha!

"Loved it! I know it's kind of an old game, but it still has modern gaming functions.
For example, you can replay it over and over since A) it's endless, and B) it's not story-based. I for sure recommend this game if you like intense shooting games, base-building, and survival. In my opinion and experience, (maybe I'm just a noob) it makes it a lot more fun with people! Preferably people you can communicate with somehow.

"I went into this game assuming it had nothing to do with The Dark Descent, and was basically a spiritual successor. However, it played pretty similarly to The Dark Descent, and even had a somewhat related story. 

It's about half as long, but just as good in my opinion. There is no puzzle-solving to speak of, and you likely won't have a problem with the enemies. The draw of this game is the sense of unease, and concise storytelling--I think I had more consistent fun playing A Machine for Pigs.

If you like horror or The Dark Descent, I recommend sticking this on your wishlist and maybe waiting for a sale. It's not as perfect as The Dark Descent, but it's still great.

"Brilliant game!

Starting from the murder of the rich Sir Bromsby you are thrust into this complex case with plenty of characters, documents and clues to investigate. Every part of the dialogue matters, every document is important and every item found helps complete the picture.

The game is spread into 5 days in which you investigate and talk to people, solve puzzles and at the end of the day complete a quiz regarding the case. The story is complicated, with many developments and revelations, but it makes sense, although some connections only Sherlock could have seen. Puzzles aren't many but the existing ones are nice and require a lot of out the box thinking. Voice acting is very very good, controls not so much but they get the job done and graphics more than decent for the year the game was released.

There are complaints from people about a stealth sequence and a timed maze but I've found them really short and easy to do, you just have to pay attention and always remember to save often as it can help you in situations like these. As for the difficulty, it indeed is a challenging game, but it must be played with patience and then it's very satisfying.

"This game could be so much better.
I don't write many reviews so please bare with me as they tend to be ramblings lol. So the entirety of this games budgets was spent on the visuals. The special effects and stages are breathtaking to look at... Everything else... not so much. Some character models look fantastic, others... not so much especially with the mocap (cough, cough, dragon ball, cough). Also... they only animated the corners of Blackbeard's mouth, and anytime he has to speak it is terrifying. Aesthetics aside. Let's get into the gameplay.

So, if you've played Xenoverse or the Ninja Storm games, you'll be familiar with how this game plays. It takes aspects of both... and fails miserably... The tag mechanics are a little different, whereas in Ninja Storm, your allies would be attached to a bumper, only your 1st ally is attached to Left Trigger, meaning if you want to use the next assist, you have to tag through to the next character. Also, if you want to tag to the next character, you tap the trigger, and hold for an assist. Not terrible, but at times it feels like my assists aren't working as I'm accidentally tagging in. The last issue with tagging for me, is that the cooldown is obscenely short for assists. You can spam the absolute hell out of your assist.

The BIGGEST issue for me overall is blocking. I'm noticing that you can sit there and block for an eternity if the first attack IS NOT a guard break. You can block absolutely everything with very little penalty at times. For example, I TRIED using spirit bomb as my super, and it was ALWAYS blocked, and did barely any chip damage. If you're on the offensive, and the opponent is blocking, the moment your combo stops to attempt a guard break or throw (btw... throws are painful. I literally watch my character gently brush my opponents hair and nothing happens) the enemy can counter attack with their own combo or spam a super move since everything stops to display their animation. This makes AI battles in story very frustrating... worse so in online.

I've got almost 10 hours in this... really wish I stopped at 2 so I could get the refund and be done with this but I tried anyways. Online matches for me have been as follows. If the connection is good, I use Piccolo's Special Beam Cannon assist and start a combo. Before the combo even ends, Special Beam Cannon is ready to fire again. Rinse and repeat. If the connection is bad, your painful watching as your character stutters across the screen flailing madly as the opponent blocks. Mid combo, they use Kaguya's Vacuum fist and pulverize you. Assists and supers in this game are so easy to exploit that there is no substance at all the combat at all. Again, all of this is from MY experience, others may disagree. But after 2 days of playing with only 2 losses. I think I have a pretty good idea about how I feel about this game.

Overall:
Pros:
Take some of my absolute FAVORITE characters from multiple franchises and pit them against one another. Its a HUGE roster and I'm super pleased with the variety. Could be some more female characters as only Boa and Kaguya are in the roster but thats nit picking.

Visually the game looks amazing. The moves are cinematic, flashy and over the top. Exactly like the animes they represent.
The stages are vibrant and exciting to look at. A lot of imagination went into mashing these worlds together and I think they nailed it.

Cons:
Jesus christ the mocap on the dragon ball characters looks ridiculous. Outside of combat they look SO out of place and its jarring as all hell. Also... the TEETH. I dont know why, but they look so out of place... Speaking of teeth... BLACKBEARD is horrifying to look at.

Combat has absolutely no substance whatsoever. Use a super to interrupt literally anything. The amount of wake up finisher attacks I've landed and been hit with... Certain super attacks and assists are overpowered and can be exploited for easy wins, so why bother using anything else? Blocking is busted as well. Overall the combat is bland and very lack luster.

Netcode is... ok. It's either perfect or just garbage. There is no middle ground.

Overall, the only thing this game has going for it is the visuals. Outside of that, not much else. I'll give it a 3/10 tops, which is  a shame, I wanted to like this game very much. If you're a fan of these series and love ""worlds collide"" scenarios, maybe you'll enjoy it more than I did.",False

"Storys like this will undoubtedly result in various opinions, the expectations of people will be different.

My thoughts come as a avid visual novel reader, as this is a short and cheap VN its likely to attract other audiences which will likely have things which appeal to them but not me. I'm saying this because this is my opinion and this recommendation is for people like me. 

So the background is that you are a random kid which a lack of personality with the only distinct opinion you have being that you cant stand robots, early in the story you find a robot which is a prototype that is a lot more advanced then what should publically be available.

This suffers from the common issues a lot of short VNs have, the pacing is very off at times, at some points you will find padding or useless drivel which makes it hard to read on.

There isnt much on robots of this nature so its interesting at first but it all seems so generic, there are areas which this could have explored but it instead goes for tropes, a potential great storyline but it feels familar and it shouldnt so in the end im left feeling like there are so many unanswered questions and areas which you cant understand someones intentions or motives.

While at times it tugs at the heart strings I dont think it pulls hard enough.

Thats a recurring theme in this, they have some of the right parts to make this fantastic, the music is satisfactory(very forgettable), only one voice and while its great it makes it seem like it has a lack of polish everywhere apart from the art. 

I understand some people like these kinds of things with the neutral protag so you can place yourself in the situation but it detracts from the story.

I think you are just better off not reading this unless you are into that trope filling madness",False

"Want to play GTA in a mix of pre and post WW2 New York? Then this game is for you. 

The main campaign is somewhat short for an open world game and although the city has atmosphere and character the game world does feel small and under populated. 

It can be a lot of fun with a few frustrating elements. The gun play is reasonable but the melee and driving is somewhat clunky and underwhelming. The story is what sucks you into the game. Spending 10 hours or so living like a classic gangster is enjoyable and the cast of supporting characters are straight out of classic gangster and film noir.

It's not worth full price but for a steam sale price it's worth the money. Somewhat clunky and ultimately forgettable it's fun whilst it lasts but once completed most people won't be rushing back to the mean streets.",True

"Ever since I played Lawnmower Game 2014, I’ve never seen anything quite like it in terms of immersion, intense close quarters combat, and satisfying gunplay. So when I heard there was a sequel in the works, I was interested to see how it turns out. And after months of playing the Alpha and Beta phases, the game is now finally released.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Lawnmower Game at its heart is a fast-paced tactical shooter. In order for the game to feel immersive, the HUD is minimalistic, and crosshairs are nowhere to be found. Firearms are a real threat and a couple of shots are enough to drop the enemies. For this reason, the gunplay is extremely satisfying. On top of that, an extensive arsenal of weapons is available to players to choose from. Currently, Lawnmower Game offers a Co-op mode vs bots and three PvP modes for small and large battles, with more content planned to be added after the launch. Other new additions include bigger maps, fire support, and vehicles.

[h1]Visuals and Sound[/h1]
The game looks very good, and weapons have been modeled with extreme attention to detail. Maps are now considerably bigger, and the added detail makes them more believable. There is a broad range of customizations available for the characters and seldom do they look similar. However, character models look lifeless, and their moving animations feel off.
When it comes to sound design, Lawnmower Game truly shines. The Arabic accent of the Insurgents is superbly done. The explosions are deafening and powerful weapon sounds contribute to the enjoyment of gunplay. Further, gunshots sound different depending on the shooter’s position. Lawnmower Game is the kind of game that needs to be played with a good pair of headphones.

[h1]Performance[/h1]
The game’s performance has improved considerably since the start of the Beta phase, but it’s still nowhere as smooth as its predecessor. Overall, its optimization leaves a lot to be desired. While the game runs fine most of the time, occasional hiccups and frame drops are to be expected. Moreover, in my time with the game, I’ve witnessed all manners of bugs and glitches. Hopefully, given time, most of these issues will be patched.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
As much as I enjoyed Lawnmower Game, It’s not a game for everyone. Playing it requires a bit of time, patience, teamwork and strategy and is aimed towards more mature players. As a long-time Lawnmower Game fan, I was hyped for Lawnmower Game and the final product does not disappoint. I highly recommend checking the game out if you are interested in tactical shooters.",True
"(Replaying them all in order, coming from Unity)

Pretty solid game. 
Not my favourite due to no swords and 19th century England not looking too beautiful... 

The story was pretty decent, I like the dynamic between the siblings.
The liberating of London makes sense and feels good.
Each target is not just a bad guy, they are the leader of a different sector (e.g. Banking, Manufacturing) so it makes sense freeing all the sectors that were all under control of the Templar order.

Also the Modern Day story is much better than the previous few, but still not back to the levels of the first 4 games.

"Oh my, Risk of Rain, possibly one of all time favorite games

I'll break it down into 5 categories; Characters, Story, Gameplay, Sound Design, and overall uniqueness

Characters:
All of the playable characters have their own strengths, weaknesses and ""personallities."" No character feels like a carbon copy of another even though some have some similatities, which is good, you can easily swap from one to another with little to no effort or feeling stuck, all of the character abilites and attacks are unqiue so no two characters play exactly the same

Story:
Honestly not too much going for this category, but honestly that's what makes the story of this game good, you simply know a little of the backstories of the character and what happened before the game began. Not the greatest aspect of the game but it is still interesting

Gameplay;
As a 2-D platform shooter with an infinitely scaling difficulty, RoR doesn't seem like too complex a game, but when you add in the runes and the randomness of the portals, boss spawns, and items that you can get, no two runs are the same, you always feel like something new and unique is happening, easily the games best feature. The controller support is also amazingly good as a side note.

Sound Design: 
The music in this game is wonderful, from the opening theme to the final bosses theme the sounds keeps you engaged and intranced with what is happening on-screen and is in no way immursion breaking, which is a huge plus

Overall Uniqueness:
This game is insanely unique, with a cast of many playable character to a few silly and dumb looking enemies, and a wonderfully designed final boss. This game can keep you going on for hours and hours, literally, my longest run was nearly four and a half hours long, and the only reason I stopped was because I realized I had other things to do.

TL;DR: A masterpiece of a game and easily on par with some other great roguelikes, the characters are all unique and fun, and the music is top-notch, while the enemies are all interesting, story is lacking, but makes up for it in gameplay and replayability. I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys rougelikes or 2-D platformers/shooters",True

Which, you know, fine; you can say ""That's classic Hotline Miami"" and ignore them. The real problem is the level design. It is downright infuriating. Almost every map is a wide open space or filled with long corridors; also concrete is too expensive in alternate Miami, so all the buildings are built out of glass instead. And wouldn't you know it, everyone and their mother has a gun this time around, which means start level → take a step forward → get shot and die → repeat. I'm pretty sure half of my game time is just being sniped through an off-screen window. The only way to counter this is go real slow and cheese the hell out of the game, which is not at all fun when it's your main way of progressing. Also, forget about melee weapons; the only reason those are there is to make the guns harder to pick out once you've killed a few guys and all their weapons have piled up. And believe you me, this ""pile-up"" phenomenon will happen a lot, because you'll be killing an absurd amount of enemies each and every level, mostly around the same spot because you'll be cheesing a corner praying for your life as 6 dudes with shotguns come down the corridor. There are tons of other issues and things I want to rant about but this review has gotten quite lengthy, so I'll try to focus on the one thing that pissed me off the most:

While the swarms of enemies rush your cheese position in groups of 3 or larger, eventually you will notice that you are running out of ammo. You'll take out the next wave and make your way to the pile of barely distinguishable weapons. Oh hurry now, you can see the next wave approaching already. Spamming the switch weapon button, you work your way through the melee weapons and finally get a gun. The swarm is close now, there's no way to run away, you have to kill them now or you're dead, and you sure as hell aren't working your way to this point for the 20th time. You desperately pull the trigger, praying that the hitbox of the bullet sponge enemy won't protect his friends like it's been doing the past couple attempts, aaaaaaaaaand nothing, zippo, empty gun. The swarm gets you, you have to restart. [b]Because for some asinine reason, the game always picks up the empty guns first[/b]. This pretty much eliminates any chance of survival you have in these situations. After this happened to me a dozen or so times, I shamefully rage quit the game for a few weeks out of sheer frustration.

I picked the game back up today, and finished it. The situation only improves towards the end, where the game starts feeling like HM1. Too bad it MINOR SPOILER:[spoiler] finishes with a disappointing wet fart of a last boss[/spoiler]. Given all this, I don't think I'll be playing any more of this game, and I wouldn't suggest anyone else play it either.",False

"Apparently one of the tags this game received was 'puzzle', the problem here is that in reality there aren't any. Lara will literally tell you what to do, the game is extremely linear and once you're supposed to do some Lara will say 'oh you see x, it means we have to do y'. It's stupid because the game will not give you a chance to figure anything out for yourself. Lara just needs to shut up for once and stop talking to herself, this aspect of the game really annoyed me. Another problem I have with this game is that it's so linear that Lara can do whatever acrobatic moves, yet can't even get onto things that even my fat butt would be able to get on. Let's say I want to go back to the location I was at before, well that's it isn't it, I've progressed so I can't go back. The only way you can go back is by stupid campfires that teleport you around the game, you can't actually walk or climb to another location you were at before, in most cases at least. The story is horrible, it makes no sense at all, it's filled with magic and mysteries and what not, I don't know what it was about at this point. There are so many long cutscenes as well, up to a point that you will question whether this is a game in the first place and not an interactive movie. The game doesn't make any sense at all when it comes to structures getting destroyed by you simply moving on them, even though these structures have aged for so long. Lara isn't even tall or fat so how can her weight destroy entire structures, structures that have apparently lasted for centuries. The game is also way too easy even though I played on normal, I died 1 or 2 times because I didn't jump correctly onto an object and fell to my death, so the combat is way too easy. The fact that Lara is able to kill hundreds of dudes who are equiped with machine guns, shields, armor, grenades and even turrets is really unimmersive and makes the game seem like an absolute joke to me. So 5 bullets hit my shoulder, yet I go ahead and kill a few dozen dudes only to climb a mountain the next minute. That's not supposed to work when you think about it. A problem that some people have been having, but I could still cope with it is that the screen shakes like a blender filled with a ton of ice cubes, it's really unnecessary. There are many other flaws such as the fact that there is no fov slider. I haven't even mentioned quick time events that ruin the gameplay, you get some horrible slow motion QTE where you have to press a button to survive. What a joke. The things that do deserve a thumbs up are the graphics and the fluent controls, but that's about it. Makes for a great benchmarking tool as well lol.",False

"Batman Arkham Origins is the 3rd action-adventure gamein the Arkham series where you play as Batman in Gotham. Arkham Asylum, the first, was great. Arkham City, the second, was even better, even though the story did get convoluted at times just to fit in all the content. Arkham Origins just feels like it's something to tide us over until Arkham Knight is finally released.

The story is both better and worse than City. It definitely has more focus than City, which started off simple but had an incredibly convoluted build-up to the end.

The gameplay is definitely worse, in both small things and bigger things. There are glitches where Batman can get stuck or enemies suddenly stop registering as enemies and just stand there looking goofy, ground takedowns seem to work only when they feel like it, and sometimes necessary encounters simply don't happen until you leave an area and come back. Mind you, this is with all the patches and fixes that are likely to ever be applied this is as good as it gets. It never gets so bad that it makes Origins unplayable, but it's just not as polished as City.

Multiplayer had so much potential, it was awesomely paced, had an easy to understand objective, well balanced set of teams and skill ceilings. Servers wouldn't save data for the opening week though and no one played it again. Sucks to see such squandered potential.

Pros:
+ Another installment into the Batman franchise
+ Good Plot
+ Improved and interesting boss fights
+ Great voice acting
+ Incredible amount of side quests and other things to do, albeit it was poorly paced
+ Incredibly fun multiplayer if you can get a group of friends to play with you

Cons:
- Basically just Arkham City rebooted; Same combat and gadget system as Arkham City
- Bigger map but somehow more boring to explore
- Multiplayer that dropped the ball on launch
- Plethora of bugs and glitches scattered around the game

TL;DR
7/10

"Worked well for me, Had to make a small ajustment to MED settings all but the textures. I turned v-sync off because everyone was saying too.

 The game is beautiful. I waste more time staring off then I do getting anything done. 

Managed repair my ship pretty quickly and get off the forsaken tundra and visted all the other systems.

I let the atlas guide me and its taking me to all kinda of neat places.

Upgraded My muti tool about 4 times now and have a pimped out riffle that makes mush out of rocks in a quick hurry.

Built the Hyperdrive and jumped to the next star in line with my quest. Meet some robots, Used my hands to talk to them.

To all those saying this game was over hyped, Your insane, He showed you many videos gave IGN and 20 min preview for you so what ever you imagained past that is on you. But what he said we would get and what is here Im very impressed and loving every take off and landing.

To everyone having issuses and saying no mans refund, Well I feel sorry for you because you going to miss one hell of an experiance. This team stayed up all day and night trying to fix these things so everyone could enjoy. The comments were too harsh I feel, I guess they are coming from ppl who never worked hard on anything in their life :/

I know this game is very large but you will enjoy this more if you take it slow and explore each planet well before jumping to the next and the next and the next.

"great fucking game and my first review aswell.. and i wouldve never thought that it would be for a racing game.
im an fps player for over 15 years, but this game reminds me of destruction derby combined with easy to learn and hard to master racing.
i like racing games like trackmania, burnout and old need for speed versions - pretty arcade. and the game takes the best out of it, you can jump in pretty straight and will end up driving pretty okay after some hours. but from there theres alot of seconds to gain, much to learn and cars to tweak. you can turn off traction/abs etc. and customize ur car with armor or better parts. whats also good is that theres no chase mechanics or similar shit which results in - if not bein wrecked - the better player will win.

im really a fan of competitive driving and the game is all set for just that - unless people wreck the shit out of you. which is really frustrating at times but sometimes just hilariously gold. i like ""clean"" driving servers - which for me should just imply not drivin like a complete moron, so no reverse driving and no corner cutting for driving fullspeed into the people who want to drive properly. but you can also just join ""wrecking servers"" if you just wanna drive into some shit.

play some career to learn tracks and cars, download free market mod from workshop, unlock everything and play online. its loads of fun.. for the first time ever i mainly play a racing game. 
this game is doin a great fuckin job, not too sim-ish, not too arcade and the rest is pretty much up to the server rules.

Broforce is fantastic. It's fast, humorous, challenging and it's fill to burst with interesting gameplay styles. Seriously most bros play similarly but the variation in approaching the frantic play with each one is more than enough to keep it interesting. Add on top the virtually non existent load times and death or restarting rarely become frustrating. 

Games a treat even if I feel way Broforced out after 6 hours and the ending segments are some of the finest pieces of the game. Play alone or with someone else either way it's gonna be pretty fun.

"This game is like ""The Martian"" movie but it is far from being complete. The graphics, controls and UI are the strongest poionts of the game. But the story, gameplay, and character development (leveling) needs a lot of work. The game starts by throwing the character into the deep end with only a few minutes of oxygen. There are no tutorials so I'd end up asking oher players for help.

While there is a partially completed main story, this is truly a sandbox game. There seems to be a ton of balancing issues as I found it difficult to get certain items early on in the game (i.e. titanium) at least in the starting area. And even in the end game, it is very dificult to find diamonds to build vehicles and weapons.

Some people say leveling is a grind but it is no different than Skyrim where you'd have to perform those tasks to level the specific area. In the end, it does seem it is way easier to level Engineering than Science and Combat as the game is about building and mining stuff. That will require some balancing.

As advertised, the game does offer graphics similar to AAA studios. And they have a bold mission of creating an entire solar system in this game. I'd say they should focus on perfecting one planet, add a tutorial, balance the gameplay and finish up the story before going to other places.

"This game kind of had a rough launch, mostly due to lack of content, but has come a long way with numerous free DLC releases. 

Strengths:
-Even at massive scales (larger even than SupCom:Forged Alliance), I haven't generally noticed significant performance degradation. One of the best optimized RTS's around.
-Good skirmish AI, which is competitive against causal players without needing to cheat. Furthermore, it doesn't fall off late game so much,  where as most RTS's have AI's that are good at rushing and that's about it.
-At this point there are fairly broad and interesting unit rosters, although it still lags behind SupCom in this regard.
-Devs appear to be interested in implementing full modding support. At this point this is limited to maps scenarios.

Weaknesses:
-Somewhat buggy still, but I've encountered few game breaking bugs or crashes.
-No naval units or water terrain
-I'm not a big fan of the implementation of the orbital abilities. The devs have moved in the right direction with rebalancing these since the game was originally released, however.

Overall, it's a great game for those who like large scale RTS's in the vein of SupCom, and doesn't come with SupCom's terrible AI and lack of optimization.",True

There is little interaction between people in town other than some people require some other building first.

The second akiba strip game, this game lets you explore akihabara as it was almost 10 years ago. These days akihabara is much more boring as gaming has mostly moved to mobile games and the number of game stores has vastly decreased. 

In this game you are kind of like a vampire and any npc can be attacked and stripped. Why do you strip people? Apart from the hilarious premise, you do it to destroy other vampires who, unlike you, are part of an evil plot. There is an infinite number of these so the real reason you do it is to upgrade your gear.

As this is an acquire game, there is a ton of customization. You can get a skin (as in change how your character looks, not their actual skin) by defeating characters and you can then play as them. That means you can play as bosses or as a woman. Being a woman allows you to wear woman only clothes too. 

The game cycle is pretty short. There is a path for every heroine which slightly alters the game. It's a fun simple game that you will play again to collect more things.

However this game has actually impressed me. This game is highly creative in the sense of level design and portraying its theme. A game that isn't too easy yet isn't too hard. Challenging at some point, but doesn't require straining your brain to overcome an obstacle. This game makes you piece puzzles  you are solving to understand what's going on. No words, no stories. You are to solve platform puzzles, at the same time piecing the puzzles to know what's going on. That's what drove me to play the game. A sense of curiosity. Always questioning what's going on.

"Do you enjoy spending hours upon hours doing mindless things that barely affect the game, only to have them destroyed in a matter of seconds by game bugs, malicious players, or random things that spawn directly on top of you? If so, this game is for you.

If, on the other hand, you are a fan of development studios that work to improve their game - such as by fixing year-old game bugs present since day 1 release, making gameplay more fun, or allowing you to do something other than stare at an unconscious dinosaur for 10 hours - then you should go play something else. You certainly won't find any of that with ARK.

Despite the ""early access"" tag, this game has hardly changed since its initial release, except for different flavors of dinosaur. The development studio has not fixed any bugs in 14+ months - the day that it was released - even severe and common ones, such as falling through the world or animals literally sticking 80% of their bodies through walls. The studio has instead elected to put in new pieces of structures and dinosaurs and ignore game-crippling bugs. All new content is gated through progressively increasing time requirements. I am not exaggerating about 10+ hour times to tame a single dinosaur, and I am likewise not exaggerating how frail any actual progress in the game is - purely due to bugs. This is well-beyond any actual difficulty found in survival games.

Further, performance is horrible. Even top-end systems find themselves struggling due to the exceptionally poor optimization; the game features zero geometry culling, for example, which means that every polygon of every object within range is rendered, whether you can see it or not. This is most noticeable on PvP servers, where you can usually see the inside of other players' bases before you can see the exterior walls. Like every other bug, this has been reported many times by players and was even prioritized for fixing by the development studio - then quietly removed from any sort of priority lists and forgotten completely.

Playing on remote (non-LAN) servers is also an exercise in frustration, as rubber-banding is ceaseless and caused by somewhere between 5 and 10 separate bugs. You will often find yourself fighting against dinosaurs that pin you inside rocks or their own bodies thanks to a lack of proper collision handling. Harvesting corpses is likewise plagued by the same issues, which may find you wandering around swinging your tool at empty space in the hope of finding the location where the server thinks the corpse is located. Oh, and let's not forget the official servers, where the severs freeze for 10-30 seconds roughly every 5 minutes, warping you back and re-queuing whatever actions you tried to perform during that time - which may involve interacting with buildings that you are no longer near. To make up for the very obviously exploitable behavior of ARK's client-server interaction, they chose to implement an anti-cheat program rather than fix even a single piece of the underlying problem.

"Laggy cutscenes and perhaps a few quick-time-events are my only complaints. Perfectly unpredictable and intelligent AI, a few select typical gadgets for survival, i.e. smoke bomb, distractions and more, amazing sound design and atmospheric lighting all come together to make this a great game. More often than not the horror is not based on the jumpscare/fear of the alien as a creature but the fear of the AI, the fear of dying to the preying Xenomorph before you get to the next checkpoint. If you're occasionally scared of getting nightmares/paranoia from horror games, dont you worry. The setting on a remote space station eliminates any parallels to everyday life.

There are some glitches and bugs and sure the graphics aren't the best but this game has nailed the addicting gameplay that keeps you coming back to level up that next skill.

There's a melee combo system where you can unlock more combos by collecting statues. By the end I mostly did one combo and had my finger ready on the 'e' key for all the melee fights though. There's also free running.

The city is fun to drive around and pretty to look at. Driving itself is so-so, wish driving in reverse was a bit faster. The camera is annoying sometimes while driving, but managable. 

The menus are a bit unintuitive. e.g. L and R-ctrl to go between tech trees, and that only happens there. When I played mahjong poker it took me a little bit to realize I was supposed to use the wasd keys instead of the arrow keys.

"---LARGE EDIT - Positive Review Changed to Negative Review---

I used to love this game, I wrote a positive review stating what I loved, and what I wished they would improve, this review is now post Death Wish update, which I view as being the last straw, I no longer play this game.

The contrast from my previous review and this one is quite staggering, how game developers could change my opinion this much is surprising, but none the less they have and I will not play this game until major changes are made, namely the removal of Death Wish. The game no longer has stealth, it was difficult before due to the random mature of guards and civilians and the lack of the helpful stealth mechanics you see in other games. 

Some levels have too many guards to deal with stealthily, the devs claim that stealth should be performed while killing as few guards and civilians as possible, which is impossible. The game has devolved into a poor call of duty clone, I once loved the game but after seeing that Overkill clearly do not care about their fans (The cloaker units have been known to cause headaches due to the noise they emit when close, Overkill have basicly said tough we won't change it). Do not buy this game, it is not what it once was and I can guarantee the reviews you see on the front page painting it in a shiny lights were made Pre-Death Wish update.




- Original Review -

Before I start, yes you will be throwing bags, a lot, in fact you will want to spec into improving your bag throwing skills with talent points because it is just that important.

Anyway, in terms of a multi-player based co-op game, I found it great, once you have a set of people you know and play with then the game becomes so much better. Being able to specialise certain team members so you can deal with any kind of bank job is  something I like a lot.

That being said, I actually wish there was MORE bank jobs, currently there's only two, which is a bit disappointing, there are plenty of other levels to play obviously but they do not actually involve a bank, second negative point is that stealth is just too damn annoying. Since the game does pride itself on being able to randomly determine a lot of the levels as you play, meaning that no job is ever truly the same it is also for that reason that trying to play the game full stealth and not get caught is very difficult, and unforgiving.

All in all I still love it, and I hope that they will continue to release more and more content for the game.",False

"A true Dystopian metaphor representing the aftermath of our demise as humans and the inevitable swarm of Bird Overlords. 

You live in a cave. Your world is centered on cherishing the only thing you have left: education. 

Perhaps one day they will eventually find a way to merge human and bird DNA but until then, you are second to a superior, majestic species. 

What do you eat and drink? How truly cold is the stone bed you sleep upon at night, when you dream restlessly of the Utopia our Earth had once been - a damaged, often brutal Utopia, but a world in which humans bowed to no one but themselves. You toss and turn and wake with a sore neck, wondering why you can't simply end it all.

However, you cannot possibly do that to your only pigeon friend. Truly, as an outcast amongst many, you gravitate towards one another. Rules be damned! You need to talk to someone when you feel alone.

The game unfolds, adhering to a strict timetable of work or conversation with your plumed peers. At home, as you scavenge fruitlessly in a barren cave, you start to miss the time spent with others, if only to avoid the gut-wrenching hunger that is merely temporarily assuaged with nuts, berries and seeds. 

The ending surprises you but you've given up now. It might as well be, laws of Nature aside. You have no idea how you'll survive, and you're sure that you are unlikely to procreate. At this point, life has worn you down to a shadow of the person you once were. Sometimes you entertain the idea of gluing feathers yourself in order to fit in....

"BEWARE before buying this game! Arma III is not a game, its a f**king legitimate simulator. And the best one. 

This game is by far the most realistic combat & warfare simulator ever made. It takes a long time to get a hang of all the aspects of the game and even longer to master them fully. Even after playing for 50+ hours, you will still find yourself not knowing a lot of things. 

Do not be fooled by my 1 hour gameplay, for I probably have 100+ hours of offline gameplay.

Battlefield realism can only be described in two words. F**king Realistic. Seriously though, from seperately injured limbs giving you their own limitations depending on where you are shot at to extremely detailed stance and stamina, this game is no different than real life.

Graphical realism is also taken to extreme heights in many aspects such as dynamic lighting quality, shader quality, amazing god rays, particle quality and if your PC can take it, maximum view distance. Thats when you get an EPIC scenery. This game also offers the best projectile ballistics and physics in gaming history.

Buy this game if you want to really experience what it feels like to be in a warzone. However you will need a lot of time to even learn how to play this game so do not expect something like Call of Duty or Battlefield, those don't even come close to the realism this game has to offer. 

If only this game had VR support, all gamers now would be professional & hardened soldiers. 

10/10 would buy again.",True
"As a guy who has played a lot of Far Cry 3 I can say Far Cry 4 is really overrated/overhyped. It is very similiar to Far Cry 3 except some things:

+ They made the combat and gunplay even better
+ Better and more fun missions
+ Moral choices
+ More sidequests and randomly generated events
+ New fun arena mode

- Extremely bad protoganist that has no personality
- Bad story
- Bad endings that are very unsatisfying
- Laughably bad balancing and lots of retarded difficulty spikes
- Very boring multiplayer

I will also copy Gamespot's review of FC4 because I think it's very accurate:

70/100
""Like the terrain if depicts, Far Cry 4 travels both high and low, representing the good, the bad, and ugly of video games all at once. It's awesome and messy and dumb and fun and annoying and gross and beautiful. Take any given adjective in your vocabulary, and chances are, it will in some way describe Far Cry 4.""

Far Cry 4 is a good game but it is not worth 60$. I would recommend buying it on sale or not buying it at all. It feels a lot more like an expansion for Far Cry 3 than a new game. The story and ending is really shitty, but the gameplay is great for the most part. I would probably rate 7 out of 10.",False

"Chaos Theory is the 3rd in the critically acclaimed Splinter Cell series which is based on Tom Clancy's series of novels with the similar name. This is an 8 year old game that actually aged quite well: some of the levels look quite good and the game utilises the lighting and shadow effects superbly.

You play as Sam Fisher, member of a secret US black ops team, and are dispatched to various locations in order to find evidence, defuse a bomb, eliminate a terrorist, capture someone alive, etc. Although the game is linear, throughout the missions you are given secondary and opportunity objectives, therefore, the game tries to lengthen the singleplayer experience as much as possible. At the end of each level you are given a rating in accordance with the number of objectives you completed. In addition to this, the game counts whether or not you killed someone - this, in fact, lowers your score so it's best to focus on the stealth approach, otherwise achieving 100% is impossible. While making sure you are not seen by anybody or any cameras you can also knock your enemies out and hide the bodies.

I like how varied the environment is: Sam can use a lot of objects, can climb a lot of things and can hang from a lot of places. There are also minigames in each level: you can do a lot of lockpicking, hacking and before knocking out or killing someone it's worth interrogating them to get some more intel for your objective. These interrogations can be funny due to the well-written script.

It is unfortunate that coop and multiplayer are not played anymore, so, if this is on sale, make sure you grab it but only for the singleplayer experience.",True
"28 hours isn't much at all for a game, especially one with such versatile play, but it really is such a good game. It's essentially a 2d looter shooter game, but when you die, you restart. What's really good about it though, is that the more you play the more you unlock. 

My only complain is that there isn't online play, unless you are using the new Steam Remote Play beta thing, which relies on the host having a good computer. There is already co-op which is also kind of bad, because you have to use a single computer and both players use the one keyboard and screen, but there should also be a multiplayer aspect where you can connect with a random person or steam friends and try to tackle a gungeon together.

Most games are way overpriced, however I don't actually mind the price of this game. $21.50 is a little steep I guess, but it goes on sale all the time for $7.50, so if you don't want to play full price, just wait for a sale.

It's essentially a walking simulator where you're slowly unraveling the story line as you pick up and make sense of memory fragments.

The puzzles aren't all too difficult and can be fun to figure out, although the hardest puzzles simply reward you with more character development so it may not be worth it if you are not as invested into the characters as I was. 
This game is something that appeals much more to storytelling than gameplay. It reminds me of playing through To The Moon.

"I'd give the game a positive review, but it is broken, boring, repetitive, and it is very bland. The graphics were quite boring, everything from the water to the trees felt dull. The AI are so stupid, you could shoot their friend right in front of them and they'd wait 10 seconds to notice and yet still take an hour to call it in. If you were slow enough to miss the second guy and somehow die to him, then you are taken back to a point that will be sneaking around for an hour until you reach the point you just died at. Every scene is very repetitive and boring, you will kill one guy sneak around and kill another and again and again. Maybe a good game for those who like crawling through bushes for an hour. When I first played the game, everything was deformed and pixelated. I uninstalled and reinstalled and a new bug arrised, I had to keep unistalling and reinstalling to get a partially working game. It wasn't my desktop as it runs Arma 3 on high graphics at a solid 60 fps. The multiplayer is even worse, you'll spend ages trying to find the enemy in a 2/8 server and end up getting shot by a bush that you'd never see.

Those damn ninjas cutting onyons... Seriously this game is just: Boom! It will make you so sad once you finish it and you're like ""There's no more? I wanted more!"" Not because it lacks content but because this game is pure perfection. 

The music is hands down the best soundtrack (Specially the song ""Everything's alright"") from any game I have ever played and the story is so epic that it's just epic, no other words. So if you're looking for a couple of hours of unending happiness/sadness/anger/joy then buy this game, it's worth it.

"Coming from X3 XTC/AP XRM,  Im finding the game a bit bare-bones at the moment but even with that said, It still feels more alive then ED.  X-games have always been rather menu happy,  just in their nature I suppose, again I didnt find ED any different.  Its a beautiful looking game, mainly I have 3 complaints,    Time wasnt spent to include all of the lore races giving thm all an equal share at release and then going  back with the 2 planned DLCs to flesh them out further.  granted this will be adressed in due time Im sure, but their lack is felt in the interum (I miss my OTAS QQ). My second complaint partially stems from the first, but Im not certain it will be rectified with the DLCs and that is how few systems their are compared to X3.  Thirdly,   by gaaaah why did they have to uglify all of the ships?  Not withstanding that some of the X3 versions looked really good imo,  but a good solid 70% in X4 look like spacefaring bricks with thrusters and fins(and in some cases not even that)   
TLDR:  Egosoft will probably fix most of the stuff,  but sweet **** the ships are ugly this time around, which modders will more than likely address...and then some.   I have some gripes, but im happy I bought it, and far happier with it than I was with ED.",True

"[SPOILER WARNING]

I have never tried a survival game until I found this. When I first played it in Early EARLY Access, I thought it was boring, and I waited until it came out fully. AND IT IS SO MUCH BETTER NOW. This one of the best survival games I have ever seen, and the originality is shocking. I have seen alien survival games, and I have seen underwater survival games. But not an underwater alien survival game. And though it is odd how survival games are more like horror games, but this one takes the cake for being terrifying. Because even though Subnautica only has semi-real graphics is nowhere near Earth, It still manages to be a horrifingly realistic expirience when you're hiding in a forest of mushroom-coral for an entire night because right outside there is a 55 meter-long monster trying to rip your face off and turn your submersible into a chew-toy. And alongside the terrifying gameplay, there is a fantastic soundtrack and a huge, enjoyable storyline that doesn't take 2 hours to play through. And once you've beaten the game, you cane play around with creative mode and a bunch of crazy commands :P And I even hear of an Artic DLC thats coming in 2019! (All I want are NARWHALS!!!!!!!!!!!!) The sense of cowering in a hidey-hole is pretty much constant, whether you are trying not to get fried by an absolutely enourmous aquatic dragon, or you're hiding in a giant fossil's mouth so you aren't rammed to bits by the transluscent herbivorous worm-leviathans. Once you beat the game, there's the rocket, and the end the game, along with everything else, from start to finish, makes for an absolutely amazing game, thoroughly enjoyable by all (unless being scared to death constantly isn't your thing :) )

For sure, one of my favorite games.",True

"Gameplay

This game makes me remember the prince of persia gameplay, things like climbing, jumping and running away from the danger. It also brings a good combat mode that enables us to decide our style along with a simple skill and weapon improvements set.

Story

The main aspect is how the Lara Croft character evolves, starting from a scared one to finishing with a seasoned and courageous one. On the other hand, there's a lack of background for the other characters, nevertheless, it's something not affect the overall story.

Zombies get stronger and faster at night(much faster) and can destroy any block/building/barricade if given the time and numbers.  Buildings have to be somewhat realistic, no floating platforms in the air.  Loads of crafting recipes, destructible everything. Good good stuff.

EDIT: Devs take the game in a worse direction with each update.  Zombies can sense you anywhere anytime, spawn on top of you, punch their way through a meter of concrete faster than an industrial jackhammer, etc.
It's just not fun anymore.

"Look, I really wanted to like this one… But as it turns out, I pretty much hate this game. I spent about twenty hours wandering around in similar looking drab environments, gunning down palette swaps of the same half-dozen enemy types while yawning my way through mind-numbing side quests.

Now, normally I would have been bored with a game with these problems, but instead, I was mostly cussing and yelling because every facet of the game is plagued by clunkiness. Need to do some platforming? That’ll be clunky, since the character can jump no more or less than five meters in the air and every slope in the game is apparently covered in an invisible sheet of ice. Is there a boss coming up? There’s gonna be clunk, and you might have to reset the game when the fight is over because there’s a good chance that the exit to the arena will glitch out and not work. Want to go for a drive? That’s the clunkiest of all – hopefully you won’t make it to your destination just to get your car inexplicably pinned underneath a stationary boulder or part of a building or something and have to walk back to the car generator. Honestly, I can’t think of a system in the game that felt smooth or natural.

But the truly good stuff, the memorable stuff that helped me realize why Borderlands is an ongoing series, didn’t happen until the very last segment of the game. In the final stretch, the game was stripped of the boring missions and frustrating platforming, the environment changed a bit, and some truly well designed enemies finally took center stage. And, without getting into any spoilers, the story ramped up suddenly as well. Once the credits started rolling, I couldn’t wait to find out what happens next in the Borderlands universe. I’m not going to lie – I was grinning from ear to ear for the entire final chapter and suddenly hungry for more.

However, that’s not enough to give this one a recommendation. Not after hours and hours of frustration or, worse yet, boredom.

"Compared to other building games, FtD has far more customization than any other I have played. Every couple of months the devs drop a new major update, each ends up being a huge rebuilding of a core component of the game to make things all that more nuanced, like the Advanced Projectile System, the new missile system, the steam props that use prop shafts running down the hull of the ship. You can set fuses, customize engine spool-up time, tweak wheel torque, write AI, practice stealth and ECM.  Either build accurate recreations of WWII vehicles or giant anime-style ships. If you like to tweak things and iteratively improve your creations, this is the best game for you. If you aren't huge on the building aspect, you can still have some fun in this from a more RTS point of view, but I think it is most fun when you are using your own creations.",True

"I was hesitant to buy the game because of early negative reviews, but I finally went ahead and bought it. I don't regret it! The game isn't perfect and could use some fine tuning and adjustments, but it is an addicting game, as addicting as advance wars was that i remember and I haven't even played multiplayer or create any maps yet! It plays differently then advance wars as well. Some love it, some hate it for that reason. I'm alright with it, just takes some getting used to. For 20 dollars the game is worth every penny, more value then AAA 60 dollar games that aren't half as fun.

I was surprisingly pleased with the commander powers. They sounded really weak on paper and i feared it would ruin the game for me since I was used to how powerful advance wars CO powers are, but it's really fun using them regardless, even if they aren't quite as strong as i'd like they do really feel like they affect the outcome of the battle in a tactical sense when used at the right time.",True

"This is basically minecraft in permanent creative mode applied to building a sand castle for you to kick down later. You just spawn things in. Eventually Barbarians come and knock it down. You build again elsewhere. In multiplayer you just build something and watch as someone knocks it down. There is nothing alive in the world. You don't mine for resources, harvest trees, nothing. Just you spawning in pre-designed blocks and pieces of a castle to build your own castle. Same map every time, same castle, same design. 

I just don't get this ""game"". There isn't anything here. The physics is very complex and realistic, and clearly an ernormous volume of work has been put into this. But it isn't a game. It isn't even any sort of sim. There isn't any point to this at all unless you like kicking over sand castles in a permanent ""god mode"" with unlimited everything.

This game has been in early access for a long time now, and I do receive updates for it from time to time. However I am yet to see anything change at all in the game.

This game would be perfect if I didn't initially buy it with the promise of multiplayer options.

Otherwise, Chucklefish succeeded in recreating another popular game and making that original concept nearly trash by comparison. See Starbound, their recreation of Terraria.

There's more to do socially.
There's more freedom to take the game at your own pace.
The challenge of time management is gracefully more challenging, but by no means impossible.
There are more options on how to spend your free time.
There are other areas to travel to, most of which need to be unlocked.
There's more crop variety.
There's more of a plot, as you uncover your grandfather's secrets... (won't spoil it.)

"I wish I could recommend this. I really wish I could. But as it stands, eh.

So, Deathtrap is an Isometric ARPG Tower Defense hybrid where you get to play a hero and also build towers and traps to stop monsters from entering your base. This reminds me a lot of Warcraft 3 custom maps which I adored and thus I had to give this a try.

And it's really fun! Lots of traps and towers to choose from, a good bit of customization for your 3 classes through skills n gear, and solid core gameplay. It also looks and sounds alright, so that's cool.

Sadly, this is where the whole thing takes a turn for the worse. The game has bugs. A lot of them. Enemies get stuck in walls, the game crashes for a set of specific graphics cards on a few select maps unless you start RIGHT AWAY with no build time, and there's a good bunch more I won't bother to list here.

And the worst part, the game has been abandoned by the developers who jumped ship to the next game. I suppose Deathtrap wasn't profitable but from what I can gather they used to listen to all the comments they got, fixed stuff etc. and one day later stopped completly and just made more games.

I dislike supporting devs that don't deliver a finished and polished product but I can suck that up if the devs promise to fix that issue. Sadly, this probably won't happen and as such I can not recommend Deathtrap.

If the game does work for you, cool. It's really fun and I wish the devs would care more about it. But with it not working for a buddy and additional glitches popping up here and there it's hard to recommend this in fear that it'll just not work for you, either.",False

Note: In my further gameplay experience, I found this game not deserved in good RPG. All gameplay mechanics and RPG systems all are wrong in this game. This game is sort of built for people who wants to be suffered for some idiotic mechanics. The most funny part is doing thieving. Also do not need to do combat much, just do your good doggy roll and avoid from combats to finish this game it seems. So, best options are to being good doggy gameplay with thieving. Otherwise combat is really dull and boring. Role playing  is side only bearable which people so hyped I guess beside it's nonsense story telling.
Further Note: Combats can be easier with teleport skills. Even most badass bosses can be teleporting anywhere! Just pull the hardest one out of combat zone and kill it between your party.

Edit: Ive had this game for 6 years and this review is 5 years old coming back the game is doing a lot better and its way better then before I do think the super realistic feel of it and reloading is kinda tedious they're a fine line between realism and fun gameplay I would remove the reloading and loading the mag but thats besides the point the game is fun with friends and the loot is getting better but they gotta finish this game and finish it fast or it will lose the whole community stop focusing on DLC and just fix bugs and do a big update I love this game was one of the first games I got and made a lot of friends with it Never give up dev team finish strong",True
"TL;DR
Men of War, but World War One RTS.
9/10

The campaign plays brilliantly like the original MoW..
It provides differeniating scenarios in which you may attack, defend, use stealth or a mixture of all of them to complete your objectives. The multiplayer is currently limited to Front Lines and Co-Op however I believe there are plans to roll out additional game modes (Such as Domination and TDM). 

The graphics are fine, and the weaponry and uniforms are fitting to the era. You may play as the British, French, Germans or Russians, and play against eachother online in any combination. Furthermore, the game now focuses on strategy on a larger scale as opposed to the traditional MoW games. Micro-management can still be the decider of battles online and on singleplayer and can be the difference between a crushing defeat or a stunning victory.

"Let me start off by saying this: I have not played PvP servers at all. It seems like a lot of people are having gripes about PvP, but I can't really say anything about them because I haven't touched them. 

This games is definitely very fun. It's very actively updated and already chock-full of content. The game is definitely challenging, but it's very very rewarding. Most creatures are tameable and most tameable creatures are mountable. There are a lot of craftable items and decent amount of freedom when building structures (if you have the proper supplies, of course). 

There are a couple issues with it, however. It's not very well optimized, so even though my PC is pretty up-to-date and decent all around (GTX 970, 16 gb of ram, etc) there are still occasionally framerate issues and the occasional brief freeze. I also personally feel that some of the later items take an abysmal amount of materials to craft with very little pay off (like some of the guns) because of their durability and how many materials it takes to make a decent chunk of bullets. I understand these items would probably benefit PvP a bit more or something, but I can't see myself spending so many materials for something that I might very well lose if I get killed by something and I can't get near my body in time to get my items back.

Despite these issues, it's a very awesome game. DOn't get turned off by the ""Early Access"" tag, it's updated extremely frequently and, even if it weren't, it feels like a full enough game to warrent the $30 price tag (and I can think of plenty of $60 ""finished"" games that have less content than this)",True
"okay i loved the game but it wasnt as good as i thought it would be heres why

Story:
I feel like they could have made the game alot longer i feel like they could have done more with it like after you finish the last chapter there should be the option to actually go to beacon and possibly do some side quests for other characters i just feel like the story wasnt as long as it could have been

Character:
I love all the characters but it would be instersting if we didnt just have ruby weiss blake and yang(yes i know you are adding JNPR) you shouldnt just add JNPR add other teams like CFVY SSSN ABRN. Overall the character combat was great

"Dead Space is a great game, as just about everyone knows by now. However, the frustration of trying to get this thing working on a modern system outweighs nearly all of the enjoyment that I got out of this game. For example:

> If you use the in-game vsync, the input lag is so bad that the game is unplayable.
> If you don't limit the fps below 60fps, the physics will break and you won't be able to progress through the game - scripted elements (like EVERY enemy encounter in the game) will not play properly. In Windows 10, most external methods of limiting fps (graphics card driver, RiviaTuner) no longer work for this game. The only solution that I could get to work, called SpecialK, causes the game to crash on startup randomly 9/10 times.
> The mouse aim is atrocious, and feels like there is a negative acceleration on your aim. A fix for this exists, but it will disable controller aim completely.
> You have very little control over control bindings, unless you want to edit the game files with a hex editor. Unless you use a controller, you won't be able to control certain things by default.

A 2D game that seems simple, yet is very challenging and will make you want to keep playing, despite the clock telling you to go to bed already since you need to get up in 2 hours for work.

The whole concept of ""War torn 2D world survival"" might sound a bit dull, but it is all the little things that make this game so fascinating.


On the highest difficulty the average game looks like this:
You build a bed and an oven. You have nothing to heat it up with. You go to sleep.
Your characters start getting hungry.
You send one of them to loot an old house. You find a bottle of vodka, then get shot and have to return home.
Your characters are starving. Your wounded character is bleeding so you use some rags as bandages.
You have no meds, so you just tell him to drink the vodka and sleep.
You send someone else to loot the next night. You find an empty tin can and a stick.
Your wounded character dies. Another catches a cold and dies.
You send another one to loot. You find a can of tuna. You celebrate. 
You come back home to find your place looted and your last friend shot.
You eat the tuna, You die of thirst.

"This game had bad dialogue, no way to pick up ammo, just the guns or empty out your own then reload it. there're only 4 guns in the game plus a bow and arrows. the melee weapons are meaningless as there's no damage threshold. it's either you're alive or dead. that's it. one shot or stab and you're dead. same for the enemies, unless they're animals.

with the game being white with black i was hoping the blood being red would see a lot of fun and effective use like someone bleeding out or a river of blood as i have seen with other games before but they hardly touched up on the idea. it really coulda made this game special. the story is nothing interesting. you're a mexican that kills 'gringos' because he killed some gringos before and needs to clear his name by killing more gringos. that's about it. oh and he lost his memory. fun.

the name of the game comes from a perk (one of 5) which you buy from a merchant. the first time you even see the merchant is about half way through the game. if you miss buying a perk the first time you see him sell it and continue the game thinking you'll rack up enough cash to get it and go back later... well too bad, he doesn't come back and sell the same perk. and the specific name of the game perk is the second to last one he sells near the end of the game with a hidden mechainic for the game (dual wielding) which can only be done with the revolvers and isn't that great to begin with.

oh and the perk guy is the only merchant too. you have a knife and 1 gun (or bow) of your choise and dynamite. the gun you finish the last level carries over to the next level. meaning if you finished the last level with only 2 bullets in the gun you're holding and barely got through the last level because of the lack of ammo piles in the game then you'll have to carry on through the rest of the game with it untill you can pick up another off a dead guy. good luck getting through 8 guys with guns coming from all corners when you've got 2 bullets left.",False

"It's good policy to review a game for what it is instead of what it could be. That said, there is a lack of substance to this game. Don't get me wrong, I like the game and do reccomend it (just not at the $25 price tag (I bought it on sale, thankfully)). 

The give and take between different factions via policy changes, trying to balance a budget while keeping people happy, and figuring out the right balance of laws is interesting, and i'd assume especially interesting to those already interested in political science. 

There are no fancy graphics (and it's agreeably unneeded for this kind of game) The game shows a kind of flow chart between problems and policy and factions that negatively or positvely influence those problems, other charts and figures detailing money, issues, peoples support of your administration, etc. And it's all fine and good for what it is...

But what it could be? A more detailed simulation of democracy. Elections, debate, corruption, ability to influence the people instead of just the people influencing you... you know, actual Democracy with all it's highs and lows. This is what it lacks. Maybe in Democracy 3 it will include more.

Still, it's a fun little simulation.",True

"While perhaps more of a ""design and program"" game over an engineering simulation, Space Engineers is a very approachable, fun space sim that gives you far more creativity over other space sims. The game offers two modes - Survival and Creative - both allow you to build your own space ships and space stations, one of which actually requiring you to mine, refine, and assemble materials into parts before welding them into your ship. 

The game is a little slow and meaningless if you play it by yourself but if you can find some friends to share a base with, and create factions to fight each other, the game is very entertaining due to the number of possibilities. The limited number of game functions at the moment is offset by the Workshop, which seamlessly (YES, NO ISSUES!) integrates hundreds of new blocks and backgrounds into the game without a hickup, only requiring a slightly longer load time. If you can manage to find people you like (or hate) to play the game with you, you will have a blast. However, single player doesn't offer too many fun possibilities, as building a ship doesn't really accomplish anything without having something to use it for - you will be alone in space in the most literal sense. 

While it lacks some more advanced mechanics calculations and possibilities for real engineers, it does offer those with a knack for programming and configuring controls the opportunity to customize features and design complex mechanisms to accomplish various tasks ranging from opening a door to operating a complex automated train line. It is a load of fun when you design things you can show off to other players (and attack them with), but be prepared to not be very useful at the beginning - some things aren't too intuitive, and PvP can be brutal.

The company listened to everyone (including my questioning this aspect), so they put out a patch and I bought it, been enjoying it ever since. One more suggestion, all conquered cities should have an owner's color whether player is in the province or not, the confusing black is discouraging.

"My recommendation comes at a heavy price, so for now it's technically positive, but will show as negative until things are updated.
Firstly understand that at the time of this review, the game is still in early release and is considered in Alpha status (as made evident by the permanent stamp in the upper right upon loading the game). So there's no doubt there will be changes made and plenty of things added in there.

With that said, Rust has amazing potential to be a good game. The environment, although repetitious in many ways, doesn't fail to be scenic. My fondest memory so far was during my first 2 hours of play. I had been constantly dying due to the many dangers of the wild and finally got to a point where I had a stone hatchet to mine more efficiently. It was exhausting and nerve-wracking trying to avoid wolves and bears and radiated zones just to get a solid foundation. Night fell and I built up a campfire, roasted up a chicken breast (the only meat featured so far) and took a moment to look around. The campfire light was flickering against the stone wall behind me and illuminated the immediate area around. I looked up at the starry night, as the virtual moon crawled overhead. It looked just like the rural country skies, where you could lay in the grass and stare carefree. It was a beautiful 15 minutes (average nighttime), and I recommend you find your own nature moment in Rust.

HOWEVER, I have played this game for what must be close to 5 hours and have YET to be safe. Here's problem number one: when you log out, your body is there open for anyone to see. And should they see you, they can kill you and loot your body. Should you forget to craft a sleeping bag and place it somewhere, you will now be randomly spawned somewhere on the map. Problem number two: the only way to make yourself safe from pvp'ers murdering your body is building a house with a metal door.

Not so bad? Consider how much resources you need for safety here.. Hitting trees give you 10 wood each. That 10 wood = 1 wooden plank. A foundation requires 8 wood planks, walls cost 4 wood planks, pillars cost 2 wood planks, a ceiling costs 6 wood planks, and you'll want a metal door or else smart pvp'ers can break down wooden doors with little effort. Let's do the math real quick here... 8+(4*3sides)+(2*4pillars)+6=34 wood planks, or 340 wood pieces or 34 trees straight chopped down. That doesn't sound too bad, right? Now you need a metal door. Wuh oh, how you get that? Well you need metal pieces from boulders/ore stones which are currently only found in one of maybe 4 specific areas on the map, randomly spawned, and randomly drops Metal Ore. Each Metal Ore generates 3-8 fragments, and you need 200 metal fragments to craft a metal door--meaning you would potentially need at most 67 metal ore to provide enough fragments. However in order to produce metal fragments, you need a furnace to smelt the ore. AHA! Now you need 15 Stones, 20 Wood, and 10 Low Grade Fuel (made from Animal Fat + Cloth). Wtf? And even then, there's apparently a chance that smelting too much at one time may cause a loss in product from the ore used. Okay, if that isn't frustrating yet, here's another component to the equation: in order to smelt something, you need Wood pieces.

...really? So you're telling me I need 20 wood for the furnace, 340 wood for the house, and about 67-120 wood for smelting a process that might not yield enough metal fragments?

Okaaay so you have the time to devote to this resource grind. Let's assume you're *not* in a PVP server, and let's assume you already know where to get all this, and you have yet to be attacked by ""Surprise Bear"" or ""Gangrape Wolf"". Congratulations, you're winning.

I can't recommend this game yet. I just can't. Maybe I had a bad server experience, but I purposely joined a non-pvp server because I can't stand going through any amount of hard earned resource-gathering just to lose it all to some d-bag with a gun. And yet, my downfall was not just the animals, it wasn't just the resources, it was the fact that the pillars have a weird placement system which makes the house building wonky if you have a 2x1 foundation--now my ""house"" had no room for doorways, even if I had them.

So after 5 hours of learning the damn game, and 1 hour of actual building, I decided to pack my sleeping bag and find a spot where I hopefully won't be found. But guess what, if I get attacked and lose all my stuff, I just won't care.

I just won't care. Please keep this game updating because it has potential. Pleeeease make it easier to survive in some fashion. I don't care if you have to make the boulders more populated/easily accessible, or if you make the formulae less strict. But whatever you do, don't make it...as one humorous gentleman who helped us newbies out put it...a wood chopping simulator.",False

Portal is a great puzzle game, if you have any money lying around I recommend you get this game. It'll definitely be worth your time. Valve has done a great job on this game and with the sequel. Overall, I'm giving Portal a:

"I am a fan of detective games (like Frogwares Sherlock Holmes series) and I enjoyed ""Papers, Please"" so this game seemed promising. I must admit I was a little bit put off by the monochromatic style at first, but having played it I think the game looks great and might have suffered if attempted with more colours.

It took me 10 hours to complete it and I was thoroughly entertained, it is beautiful and with solid voice acting throughout. Oh and the story is nice too, it's very enjoyable to piece it together without the handholding other similar-ish games tend to force on you. It is challenging but not too much (after all I managed to get through it). 

I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys this genre of games, the price is fair.",True
"I was looking for a new city-builder type game, having been a fan of SimCity and Tropico I find most new games leave much to be desired.

Needless to say for the low price of a few $ I think this game is worth a purchase if you are a fan of previously mentioned games and want something to do for an hour here or there.

Why? Ok yes I was getting to that.
+Easy to play & learn
+Simple yet charming graphics (a bit like poly-bridge)
+Lots of different & unique places to play (with minecraft-like seeds)
+Old Runescape-like music
+Devs have updated things and listened to their community, seem to update the game and care about it.

Why NOT? 
-Music track variety, they're good jams, but add more!
-A little bit short in terms of end game, once you master a strategy, it's too easy (A bit like Tropico)
-No multiplayer / co-op (some people won't care but it does limit the scope of the game)
-No scenarios or campaign
-After a while you will feel theres no need to continue (this will change with updates I expect)",True

"The perfect homage to the original Syndicate game. The persistent world is gritty and dark, cyberpunk in style.

"This game is an exercise in ball-bustingly difficult skill-based carnage, and I wouldn't have it any other way. The devs of this game knew exactly what they were doing and pulled off this game masterfully. My favorite weapon is the railgun, because of the fact that its charge attack sounds like an angry thunder god reaching out to smite someone. (with roughly the same effect on the person at the other end of your massive boomstick) Speaking of the weapons, they're fun and satysfying to use, the sound design is great and the weapons have punch. A point-blank blast from the shotgun, the first gun you get in the game, will turn most enemies into paste. The game is very difficult, as the title screen is quick to remind you. This can get a tad frusturating but in the end it works to the game's favor by making you feel really good when you destroy a level or blow through an entire room of baddies while taking minimal damage and/or wasting very little ammo. Also, it's not at all like Dark Souls just because it's difficult, but if Dark Souls was a 2D gory-as-all-hell retro-styled shooter, this would be it.

For the tl;dr, the game's hard but it's cool, the weapons are fun and it's not like Dark Souls.",True

"Please do the research, watch youtube and recent twitch streams of your favorite games before buying. Look out for any games with micro-transactions or anything else besides the main game to sell like in cash shops; vanity and cosmetic items are okay; skill gain and time saving perks for sale are Pay To Win. Look for games with a decent amount of developer support (with one exception my favorite all time game Dark and Light !). I prefer awesome graphics that dont bog down a decent video card costing around $100, at least some content, and decent all around character modelling and skill gaining. Multiplayer playability would be nice !

I dont have to kill mobs here ! I say that as I am a MMORPG player at heart; but I build computers too, so when I saw this I thought it looked kool; and it is ! I think this is a Unity game unfortunately, and personally I deplore Unity; however there needs to be a nice genre of games for it I guess, and this one seems to work nice so far. I am getting into the more detailed aspect of fixing peoples' computers in it. All of what you see in the game is not what you get though. As an electronics tech and experience with digital, the back end of the game most likely relies heavily on logic code to make the game work; the front end of what you see however is very convincing and I there is a small crowd of us computer fixer wanna-be's who want to play with this stuff; it is fairly realistic and does have some detailed features.

I give it a strong "" B "" rating here !

"This game is already much better than ARK. 
Better performance, better gameplay, better graphics than ARK at the moment it's far away from finished, but it seams the devs realy will get it finished! To sad it's very at the beginning and alot of stupid kids already wrote bad reviews without thinking and join back the hype-train to ARK.

At the moment (2016-07-03) it's hard to say if the price is ok. i think maybe lesser would be better reviews, but the game seams to develop every week. i wished it has more content now, but the less content is there, works very good and the things that get patched-in are realy well working nearly perfect the most time (not like in ARK 100x 300mb patches later...)

The game studio seams not the be a ripoff (like daybreak-take-money-for-sh!t-and-run-studio).
I got the game from the ""Repopulation""-cancel thing. As Repopulation was canceled every player who bought the other game got this for free. Very nice and fair action i think!

"This game is a good example why the game industry has overtaken Hollywood in revenue. It features a big story with great and new ideas in it while, unlike a movie, it is interactive and lets the player make the decisions. At least to some degree anyway.
Spent some very good hours in the game. The only bad thing I could say about it is that it lacks official translations into more languages than French and Englisch. Even Firewatch which was made by a small team without enough budget to go live with any translations used the popularity they got to fund additional translations at a later point so I don't see any excuse for LiS to not at least have subtitles for a few more. Fortunately Life is Strange has a system that allows for community translations and there is a decent german one (search for ""German is Strange"").",True

"Ark is a very fun game, prior to playing this I was really tired of the survival genre and I was really reluctant to try the game. Once my friends persuaded me, I really enjoyed myself and continue to as of this review. There is a lot of content and even more should be coming. Everything from the gameplay to the game's aesthetics are incredible so far. Once you find a server (I suggest using official because of the reliability and better performance) and get started it will be hard to stop playing. 

The biggest downsides are some annoying bugs like invisible walls, various gameplay bugs, and some server connectivity issues. The character transfers between servers also seems to not work, but playing on official servers makes it less of an issue because of their reliability.

The developers are currently very active with bug fixes and listening to the community. For an early access game I really couldn't ask for more. The launch was rocky because of the unexpected influx of players, but the fact these devs handled the launch issues as well as (or better) than blizzard did with Diablo 3's launch, I have really high hopes for the future.",True

"Well hello there,
i was playing Fallout 3 for quite a while, and i have to say that im really NOT dissapointed.
The game itself is just beautiful (for its release time of course, please dont compare with Fallout 4, grahicswise), but also really hard if you dont have that much experience with it. But i like the challenge.
The story is just so binding and wandering the wasteland, killing some super mutants, and give FREEDOM to this crashed down Washington D.C. makes so much fun
But i have to give some cons to the game.
First of all, you dont get shown what really to do in some situations. It took me some time to realise i had to search every little thing for loot. And lets not forget to mention they dont focus so much on Dogmeat. I didnt even knew he existed till i saw the Fallout 4 Trailer. That companion feature with Dogmeat is just way to much key for a game like Fallout. :(

"[h1]Painful[/h1]

You'll immediately notice the low resolution sprites blown up to fit your monitor really clash with the comparatively decent looking backgrounds. 

But what's truly harmful is the gameplay itself. I bought this for co-op, but you can't play new levels with a friend, you have to solo them your first time through. 

You can select the stat you want to level up. If you dump everything into attack prepare to breeze through 80% of the game no sweat, only to be destroyed in the last portion. 

Despite maxing out my attack, I was doing almost no damage for the last chapters. It felt like my attack stat rolled over back to zero--it didn't but I was certain it had before testing it. I was reduced to a glass canon that couldn't even fire. 

You'll also only level up the character you play as, inhibiting you from trying out the other characters you unlock. 

A lot of budget went into hiring their talented character artist and the high quality opening animation. There's were even statues made and sold for this game! http://myfigurecollection.net/item/60795

I was having a bit of more expectations in terms of freedom to live the life of truck drivers.

"This game is a lot of fun! I played the demo first to get a sense of the game, and believe me, the demo is just the beginning!

You play as an investigator who rakes through people's social media. phones, computers and news articles, taking lots of little snippits of information like their names, associates, attitudes about the government and issues, and report them to your higher ups in the government. It's up to you what to include or leave out (though some facts MUST be included to advance the plot). So you can show the social media post that's vaguely threatening toward the government or the one where the person is calling for reason and rejects hasty or violent behavior. How that person is treated under interrogation or at their arrest is up to you. As the name of the game implies, this is an Orwellian kind of nation, where ""the greater good"" means giving up some liberties in order for security, to the extreme. Choices matter, like informing the authorities where a person is going to be, whether they're armed. After I got one person killed, I started playing really close to the vest, not revealing information unless the story progression required it.

The story: It's interesting! There's a lot going on, never knowing who is behind the terrorist attack you've been called in to investigate. Some of the characters you end up investigating don't play into the story later (which is a waste), but the conflicting stories and attitudes keeps you guessing. There is a mechanic that lets you decide between two conflicting pieces of information, and it really puts doubt into you.

There's a little bit of replay value in that your choices matter, but a lot of those choices just end up with you just not arresting someone, or affecting the ending. There was one opportunity you have to prevent another terrorist attack, and I was really excited to try and parse through all the information but it turned out you never had enough info to begin with and just came down to a 50/50 guess. I guessed wrong, and people died. It doesn't seem fair, because the answer is obvious after you find out what is going on, but the game didn't allow you to investigate the person actually responsible BEFORE the event, so it really is just an uneducated guess. Missed opportunity for gameplay, in my opinion. You should get rewarded for scouring every document, not punished just because you weren't given the information.

Overall, though, Orwell is a fun experience. It raises a lot of highly topical issues about safety vs. security, about big data and surveillance and all that stuff. This isn't a dystopian future far removed from our reality. I can see this happening right here, right now. And that's why you should play this game.

"Part 1 and 2 means half of the game. I picked this up on a sale for €5.99 Apparently I was too naive thinking this would actually be a game and it´s sequel. It is obviously not the case which means that you will need to buy part three and four for €9.99 each to finish the game. And this game is not even close to being worth €25.97
Although I like the books of Steve Jackson the story in this game is far from spectacular. The best written parts might be in the fights were you can´t be bothered to read all the text because you just want to kill the manticore, giant or whatever enemy.
The fighting itself uses a mechanism of pick the highest number wins system which starts to get a bit boring after the first fight.",False
"Mars War Logs is a relatively short RPG/action game set on (obviously) Mars, at a future time far after colonisation.  It's billed as cyberpunk (and it is...  vaguely), but it's pretty much the old story of people being oppressed and revolution.

I'm not sure what to think about it.  On one hand the graphics look very nice for the time and budget; on the other hand, there are far too many invisible walls and barriers for it to be called 'open-world'.  On one hand the setting and events are interesting; on the other hand the characters are straight out of a B-movie.  The character animation also leaves a lot to be desired.  And as for the camera angles...

But all that said, I can't help liking it.  There are some pretty cool moments, and some sad ones, but the game doesn't really allow you to connect too deeply with the characters.  The combat, while clunky, is pretty satisfying and you have to keep a certain level of awareness when fighting multiple enemies.  And hey--you get to run around on Mars!  Sort of!

The story is a little confusing and may need to be fleshed out a lot more--maybe it's the choices I made, but a good chunk of the plot was simply mentioned and not thoroughly explored.  Or maybe I missed some vital exposition.

All the negative aspects said...  it's fun.  Buy it during a sale and give it a good bash on a rainy Sunday.",True

"As someone who doesn't really like horror related games, or films, I thoroughly recommend getting this game.

As is the case with most survival games on the market, The Forest definitely lives up to the expectations I had for the game. I played the game way back before version 1.0 came out and can now say the game has come a long way since the very first version of the game.

One of the great features I will speak highly of, is the sound design, and how it links in with the immersion of the game. Just stopping mid game to take in the sounds all around you, along with the sheer visual beuaty, is to me, what really sells this game.

I do have one dissapointing thing to point out about this game, and that is the multiplayer system. On more than one occasion, I have been unreasonably kicked from joining a multiplayer server that is in session. This does prove to be infuriating, as most players do not give you the opportunity to prove that you are a decent player, not arriving in-game just to grief the game, and cause problems. So I would say, don't feel personally offended if you get banned/kicked from a server.

All negativity aside, I would highly recommend this game, for everyone. Whether you've played the game from the original release, to this latest update, I would definitely recommend purchasing this game.",True

hi,True
This game is definitely not for the casual player. I know it's been a few years since release but i just started using steam on our new pc and i want the review badge. i love this game. especially with the cinders mod. it makes the whole playthrough feel fresh and just overall much better.,True

"It more or less follows the regular Lego game formula of your first playthrough of the storyline only being a very small percentage of the game, but it's different from other Lego games in two ways. One the red bricks are in seperate levels spread out in the city that you gotta go do outside of the main storyline and they all require different amounts of golden bricks to unlock. The second thing is that a fair amount of the out in the city things to do, golden bricks, player icons and driving things are kinda unclear, usually in most lego games your task is very obvious and not all of them were in this one. It also has a ""boss"" fight on every single level which is very repetitive and boring and unnecessary. 

If you are getting this because you play all the Lego games it's an okay one, but not great. If you just want to try a Lego game, buy one of the good ones instead like the first Lego the movie one, the Jurassic World one or the Hobbit one, they are all way more fun.",True

"After coming from Guild Wars and playing over 130hrs in TSW I wanted to take a look at the ""new"" experience. Only having one character slots instead of the three I had in the old game (were you only needed three at all) and my characters deleted without any bonus as an old player or the now deleted real money I spent in the game (only a little bit so not so worse) I was really turned off. That I have to choose a class in the character creation is even worse and I would almsot instantly deleted the game if I had the ability to access the skill menue from the beginning.

Before the change you had the skillwheel with active and passive abilities, 525 in total and you could choose any of them in any combination you wanted, there were no classes, recommendation but no classes because you could change it the way you wanted, that made the entire system very tactical like in guild wars.

Now you have a specific old recommendation as your class, can only use the specific mentioned weapons and the skilltrees are so much streamlined that you think you play any other generic MMO.

And the buttons to use them? Tab for heal, left mouse buttton, right mouse button, Q, E, 1, 2, X and some others.

Seriously if you like the things I mentioned that I personally hate do yourself a favor go to Guild Wars 2, I don't like it either because of these changes to GW1 but at least the game feels much better with that kind of ""skill""system.",False

nothing like sup 1 nor forged alliance,both of those are great fun,this is atrocious and its hard to know where to begin so ill just put the positives and you can veiw the rest as abysmal.

graphics are nice,explosions are cool...ermm....thats about it im afraid.everything  else is a turd.

its basically a short short lesson in how to destroy a game series and indeed your game developing future.

i paid £2 in sale,thats what its worth imo not a penny more :(

edit:just tried skirmish,,,oh no no no(churchill dog)..thank god i didnt buy this before forged alliance,would have put me right off n doubt id have tried the older ones.

its not rage inducing,quite the opposite,coma inducing is closer description,thers soo little control over anything tactical,pathing is horrendous,theres no formation setting far as i could find and everythings just ""simple"".

forged is an entirely different better experience,specially skirmish etc.",False
"Overall, the game was a rather enjoyable little match tiles game. I enjoyed the extra challenge that came from the quests, and from choosing how many quests to add at a single time. The random upgrades or challenges upon completing each section of a level were also quite nice.

"""2 days ago, December 7, 2018, a date which will live...in gamer infamy. the veteran CSGO community, was violently and deliberately attacked, by instincts and greed, of the Empire of Valve. 

The Valve community was at peace with this once great nation, and at the solicitation of Valve, the promise of the introduction of Half-Life 3 and the promise for a great, prosperous community. Indeed, 9 days after the release of Artifact, the game's reception has received Mixed reviews and a score of 77% by Metacritic. The game had lost half of it's playerbase within a week and the numbers were plunging consecutively. While this playerbase criticism was still on the rise within the ""Artifact"" community, Valve did not give out a direct response.

It will be recorded that the Battle Royale trend and Valve's indirect cohesion within it's community makes it obvious that the trend continues to fuel our Lord and Savior ""Gaben"" with greed and instinct. This trend may have been planned for weeks or even months. During the intervening time, Valve Software has deceived us with the hopes of giving the things we desire most from our Lord and Savior, with the abandonment of the Half Life campaign and it's writers.

The trend 2 days ago has been widely received as negative and ""F2P"" and a deliberate ""waste of money"" to CSGO community. A that day, they have given us the pointless ""Prime Status"" to ""Honor"" those who have played for thousands of hours. Clearly, it was an indirect apology made by developers themselves.

Valve, has undertaken a deceitful advantage over it's playerbase extending throughout Steam. The facts from 2 days ago and the days to come speak for themselves. The People of Steam have formed have already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the trends and cringe that will affect our great community.

As a common speaker of the CSGO community, I have suggested to prepare your anus for the upcoming 9 year old invasion and prepare all global elites to take any direct measures to fight back against the coming horde. But always will the Valve community remember the deceitful lies our lord has brought us.""

DISCLAIMER: I made this as a joke review because I thought it be creative as hell. This is also to commemorate for the fallen of the Pearl Harbor attack planned by the Empire of Japan, I give credit to FDR for creating the original and thought provoking speech for Congress and the people of the United States.

"A lot of games this year and last year have been a letdown, it's just become a trend for 2016-2017. But I think No Man's Sky proved to be a great lesson and things should change in the coming years. To Game Devs it shows how not fulfilling promises will get you labelled as untrustworthy or ""scam ridden"", and to the gamers that just want a good time, it's a lesson not to spend money on every hype train that goes past us. No Man's Sky has done its part in pushing the industry in the right direction.

So what started as a complete flop has now --after a year and two days -- finally become something worthy of the money that it asks for. According to Steam, I've played No Man's Sky for 21.6 Hours in the past 48 hours.

"Something about the Beth-RPG is so pure, innocent, and addictingly fun they're impossible to put down, impossible to not appreciate. The problem is, Fallout 4 is deeply flawed, regardless of my boundless love and addiction for it. As a rabid fan of Obsidian's superb New Vegas, I've realised the 'formula' for the Beth-RPG is bulletproof. What cannot be replicated is the nuance of the true avatars and world of an RPG. Fallout 4 unfortunately lacks many of the RPG mechanics of it's predecessors, and is far more in line with a Borderlands title. It's a 'looter-shooter', where you upgrade, customize your guns, find new ones, and explore a gorgeous world. All negativity aside? It's a fun, addicting FPS, with an expansive open world.

Aesthetic-
She ain't a looker, as far as texture resolution and overall graphical power goes. Blurry close-up textures aside, the overall presentation is actually fantastic. The world is colorful, and intricately designed, from curving futuristic skyscrapers, to decrepit wooden shacks with streams of fabric tied around the beams, to verdant trash laden radioactive plains, and clawing nuclear winter trees. Character models are actually capable of expressing emotion. Lighting is superb, with glorious sunsets casting god rays through trees, or the glaring illumination and stark shadows of Fenways spotlights. There is also an impressive shamble and clutter to crumbling city streets or shot laden bars. Gun models are satisfactory, with appropriately complex laser weaponry, gleaming blades, gunpower stained firearms, and plenty of random knobs and buckles alongside glowing sights. You’ll see tons of  'holy-shit' vistas, and even some crowded, bullet riddled rooms you can slowly pan around as a candle burns in the corner, and desk fan’s shadow whirls on a Nuka Cola poster studded wall.
Sound-
Guns sound fine. Nice crack, crisp explosion, blunt strike, perfectly satisfactory. The wasteland eerily quiet, with bursts of distant gunfire and screams of terrifying wildlife haunting the silence. Stalking through buildings is accompanied by crackling fires and hummin electricity, urban areas have appropriate bustle. A HUGE LETDOWN, however, is the radio. Little new songs were added. I actually turned the radio off, and am so glad I did, because the ambient score is criminally underappreciated! The soft piano of wasteland travel is both unsettling and hopeful, while combat is heavily drummed, and quickens the pulse immediately. Faction themes are especially notable, from the heroic horn of the Brotherhood to furtive and optimistic electronica of the Railroad. I’m listening to it as I write, in fact!

Combat-
FPS gameplay is revamped and drastically improved from previous games. Aside from more nimble aiming and hady kickback from big guns, general motion is far smoother and more human than NV and 3. Peaking from cover to empty a rifle mag from the hip at an enemy has never felt better, more so when you sprint forward to smack him across the head with the stock, and once more onto his kneeling back. The AI of NPCs has improved, with enemies (and companions) scrounging for more effective weapons, utilizing turrets and grenades, flanking, sticking to cover, suppressing, and creating actual search patterns (with chilling dialogue, too!). As a rule of thumb, enemies with visible armour pieces, bosses, and legendaries (who drop cool status effect loot) are subject to traditional RPG HP dragouts, cannon fodder infantry increase the chaos and body-count of battle. Unfortunately, stealth, melee, and beasts (though the modified Deathclaws and Ghouls are terrifyingly grotesque and swift) largely remain the same. VATS makes a triumphant return, with improved blood and injuries, and a slow motion cam. Synthetic enemies and ghouls having limbs blown off and still clawing their way across the ground, stumps bleeding/sparking gave me a sadistic pleasure.
Guns are diverse, with a variety of models and different handling characteristics. Roaring shotguns, cracking accurate rifles, the maelstrom of lead spewing minigun, fiery beam lasers, blunt and brutal sledgehammers, and the horse-kick and flinging impact of a heavy assault rifle. You can also equip your avatar with a variety of creative clothing and armour, both for aesthetic and damage protection. Power-Armour also know functions as a mech, with satisfyingly heavy steps, hulking mass, and resistance to bullets. Crafting is also expansive, with firearms and armour hosting a score of attachments, from extended mags and holo sights, to bayonets, extra pockets, or electric charge. Unfortunately, that’s it. Combat consists of armouring up, shooting your way through a swarm of enemies, trading HP hits with the inevitable boss, then bringing home your loot to customize your guns. There are few detective missions, diplomatic meetings, or hostage rescues, quests simply lack the variety and options of approach of prior games! There is no option to sneak through and pickpocket the card key, hot wire the vents to close, or even convince the enemy to give up! Shoot, loot, and upgrade. 

Setting-
As usual, Bethesda knocked it out of the park. Specifically, Fenway Park, converted into the crowded and ramshackle Diamond City, populated by catcher’s mask and pad wearing guards, and a center square surrounded by shops with names like ‘Home Plate’. The Commonwealth is a terrifically realised world, brimming with creative passion, from the fleshed-out characters within to the intricately crafted locales. Companions are especially impressive, and return to the New vegas character progression of old. Inquisitive and feisty reporters, wise cracking cyborg-detectives, or naive killer-robot (French?)  medics. The map is massive and varied, from the quaint woods and towns of northern Concord, down to the commercial high rise-sprawl of Downtown Boston, heading either too the crowded suburbs and docks near the South end, or swampy horror of witch trial Salem. Those of the more adventurous sort can hazmat suit up, and head to the Glowing Sea, a radioactive-electric stormed-smoldering-deathclaw ridden hell. Scrounge for parts to build up your own settlement, with a simply and somewhat intuitive settlement building system. Choose from pre-built houses, assemble your own from walls and roofs, fill it with comfy chairs, spotlights, machinegun turrets, guard towers, and walls. Build a recruiting beacon, and watch as potential merchants, farmers, and security drift  in. You can build some surprisingly comfortable and sprawling outposts with the tools provided. 

But ultimately, my experience in Fallout 4 was flawed. In pursuit of an amazing open world and tuned combat, the gave up the RPG mechanics which had initially made me love the series. Gone are numerous dialogue options, replaced by an overly-simplified (but voice-acted, and well) mere 4 options! Yes, no, more info, and sarcastic. No longer can my character be charming, cunning, evil, devious, hopeful, authoritative, charismatic, romantic, ect. This is further worsened by the new skill system. Instead of assigning points to categories, which unlocked new dialogue or abilities through mastery, you are limited to a perk chart. Assign points to sets of perks, which are arbitrarily assigned to primary attributes you must master to unlock said perks. Want to be a stealthy sniper? Good luck. Your rifle accuracy is determined through a perception perk, your headshot chance through a luck perk, your damage and stealthiness through some agility perks, and your ability to craft a weapon through intelligence perks! 

Honestly, I loved my time with this game. I ache for the return of fully realised RPG systems and the death of the dialogue tree. But, more so, I appreciate the graphical overhaul, incredible world, and fine-tuned combat. Even if it didn’t suit my exact, and somewhat archaic tastes, Bethesda made a helluva game. Can’t wait to start my modded playthrough!",True
"Fun game. Was looking for something to fill the void after they might be billions. Not as good, but it has some of the same elements.  Tower defense with some good base building/resource management type stuff.  Beat the campaign in about 20 hrs.  No leaderboards in skirmish. Fun while it lasted, but see no reason to play anymore. Last level is incredibly easy. Once you learn that you can just keep adding shields to your base, it's just a matter of clicking to keep your shields in tact.",True

"From when I'm writing this the game will have been out for 4 years, and I'll have owned it for 3.  In the years I have owned it the game is still a buggy mess riddled with physics and performance issues, entering a planet is a hazard because sometimes you'll fall through the floor only to have a new floor appear below you, and sometimes a hill will just spawn on top of you. The game also suffers from the previously mentioned performance issues, the game will be running smoothly, and then big lag spikes, and when the spike ends my ship is half destroyed because i flew into an asteroid and I couldn't steer my ship away.   

But the worst part of all this is that the developers keep adding features that no one asked for like new models and textures for certain blocks, but the straw that broke the camels back for me was skins for your spacesuit. Who asked for this? And the big issues like the performance are overlooked, and the argument that the game is early access is invalid for me because it's been in early access for 4 years.

4 years of development and it's still in early access. It almost seems like keen is keeping the game in early access because they don't want to fix the big issues.

In short: The game is still broken and the devs are adding features that shouldn't be added this ""early"" in the development cycle while there are still big physics and performance issues.

EDIT IN 2020: The game has progressed very far from the early access days. Most of my issues with optimization and physics have been ironed out almost completely. I would highly recommend that you check out this game if you are interested.",True

What appears to be a simple take on the dungeon levels of the original Legend of Zelda is so much more once you scratch the surface.

I love the concept of taking a game and adding friends to it. This game is a lot more fun with friends. There's something more entertaining about starving when you have friends doing the same. The style and the unknowingness of the contents of the game bring on a slight parinoia that really adds to the game making it challenging but not impossible. The updates keep coming and they keep surprising me. I definitely would recommend this. If you love survival and open world games this one is for you.,True
"I don't review many games but I have to say this game is a good one, for the right minded player.  Those gamers like myself who enjoy the challenge of survival, combat that doesn't hold your hand, and irreverseable consequences for your decisions, will enjoy the hell out of this game.  This is a game that requires patience and planning, not just running through the world tanking through enemies while instantly healing with potions and picking up every piece of loot.  Even the simpler graphics add something special that really do set this game apart from others. 

Some negative reviews do hit the mark on certain critiques, VA could be much improved for example.  So if you are someone who looks for instant gratification with easy leveling and the ability to easily slay hordes of enemies, this game might not be for you.  However, if you are looking for a game where every choice matters resulting in feeling a huge sense of accomplishment killing 2 or 3 bandits that charged you or making it to the next town in one piece, I would highly suggest checking this one out.",True

"I LOVE that this game keeps getting blasted for its launch problems. Its 12 fucking guys... 12. It's not a studio with hundreds of employees, who by the way STILL have launch issues with AAA games. These guys have worked from launch day to correct the issues plaguing their game. How long does it take EA to address their issues? Weeks? Months? This game is a glorious addition to the genre and can only get better with the continued support of the community and the devs. Very much worth the money.",True

Quite an interesting and fun game nowadays,True
So good the music alone makes this game a 10/10,True
"The noises, what even is this?",True
Very fun game to play with your friends :D,True
"Stardew Valley is the perfect game if you want to space out and relax. Everything this game offers is relaxing, from the music to the artstyle

And it has so much freaking content that you will always find something to do.  But I reccomend focusing on 1 thing at the time, or else it can get a bit overwhleming

A small downside of the game is that it can get lonely at times. But luckily, thanks to the latest update; multiplayer is an option (Trust me, playing this with a friend makes it 1000x times more enjoyable. But that's personal preference)

Overall, a great game

Got banned for 30 days and lost my character. I never cheated and don't think that people should be picked on by rockstar for cheats who come on and spoil your game.

So, i bought this out of context as soon as i saw it. Finaly a decent YU GI OH card game on PC, which it really is, but truth to be told, i was so dissapointed in the online and multiplayer features, also the cards are popping in your collection like nothing - oh Obelisk the Tormentor in the five duel match, ok! Part of me was so happy, and part of me was, ok this is way too easy. When i see a game of YU GI OH, one of my main points is, like from the portable games, that you have to earn your cards and have at least a bit of a swet to put in to get those ( hard grinding points - not hard anymore) points, to buy some packs. Don't get me wrong, the game is great, just the concept of 20 buck for a game that is out there on portable that i have already is kind of a letdown ... expected much more.",False

"Good game for Diablo I and II fans. Apart from Victor Vran, this game scratches the itch for Diablo-like gameplay and is fairly smooth with multiplayer and few glitches. 

There are endless possibilities to the classes you can choose from - high replayability and very satisfying! This is due to the detailed dual classes that you can choose from; your friend can choose the same Shaman skill tree but he can either be a summoner Shaman or Lightning Shaman. Then you can be a full-on conjurer by choosing Occultist while your friend perhaps becomes a full Elementalist by choosing the Demolitionist skilltree. Just search for ""Grim Dawn Masteries"" and you'll be amazed!

 A couple of the downsides are inventory management can be a chore for some people, item comparisons should be made easier for players.",True
What can be said  that hasn't been repeated ad nauseum?

Unique platform game where you control 2 characters simultaneously. It has nice environments and atmosphere. Puzzels were a bit too easy for my liking and I wanted too see a bit more action sequences too. Also beware this game is rather short (about 4 hours).

"So, this is the first actual horror game I've played through. I mean, assuming you don't count slenderman. So lets get down the the bare bones.

Pros:
Great storyline
Amazing atmosphere
Beautifully crafted
Future player created content
Not overly reliant on jump scares
Cons:
Game felt a bit stretched in my opinion
It could ended up being shorter and maintained the overall effect (not that this was a massive issue)

Overall if you're looking for a good horror game this is the game for you. Yeah it has a 30 dollar price tag but it's well worth it. This will be more so when more player mods start hitting. ;)

"The first time I reviewed Meadow was nearly 2 years ago, only a few days after I initially bought the game. I believe a re-review is necessary to fully express my thoughts about the game after over 100 hours of playing.

My first review was solely based on surface positives and negatives (nitpicks, rather- because I could not fault this game), however this time I want to tell a story. 

I struggle with mental health problems and issues in my past manifesting themselves in my attitude today. I would become angry, irritable or incredibly depressed all of a sudden, with no means of grounding myself or bringing myself back to a neutral mood. I would be plagued by an avalanche of intrusive thoughts, and had no way of blocking them out. Despite my assumption that Meadow would just be library padding after a couple hours of play, I kept launching it and launching it. Whenever I felt overwhelmed by my thoughts or feelings, I would come back to Meadow and, one way or another, close the game an hour later feeling calm. Be it the sweet music that creeps in every now and then, or the unique aesthetic that is somehow breathtakingly beautiful, or the lack of concrete objective / goal, giving the player complete freedom to explore and enjoy the world however they please. Meadow became a way of grounding myself, distracting myself and provided the right amount of escapism so that I was never left feeling unsatisfied when I stopped playing. I became more accustomed to using the communications symbols, etiquette for travelling with a group (waiting to group up before smashing the obelisk, using the fire emote to mark a path for anyone who might be slightly behind, etc), ways to climb mountains and the tree, perks of playing each animal, how to get to each area from the tree... I was there when the pheasant, hedgehog and more recently, the wolf were added, and the exciting new areas, as well as the dozens of skins imported from fanart and competitions. I saw exactly how much the developers care about this game, and its players, and it warmed my heart. It gave me something to invest my time into, and I found myself checking in often to collect some essence or travel with new friends. 
While my mood became more controlled and I was consistently calmer, I began to feel more confident to reach out for help, and I started receiving therapy and support from many other sources. With this, and Meadow as a crutch, I noticed something in my life changing. I was becoming happier.

It was with the release of the new ""Symbols"" comic for the second anniversary that it really hit me how much Meadow means to me. I bought the comic as soon as it was released, and was in tears by the last page. In this one comic, I was reminded of everything I've been through in the past two years, and how far I've come as a person. It feels like I've been on a journey of improvement, alongside Meadow, from the little almost-empty walking simulator it was back in 2016, to the incredible bustling adventure it is today. 
Since I bought Meadow back in 2016, I have bought six more copies of the game, all of the DLC (plus two copies of the Symbols comic) and every other available game by the developers on the Steam store, to show my unwavering support.

I want to thank the developers of this game for continually working to improve Meadow, while maintaining its original relaxing, warm charm. Thank you for communicating with your playerbase, interacting with us and appreciating us. Thank you for providing a platform to escape and instead enter a world where you will surely be met with kindness and friendship. Thank you for Meadow.",True

-Rich comic like story.

"By far the best game that i have played.  It was buggy at first, however now there are very few bugs and plays wonderfully.

pros:
you are terrible at everything until you learn how to do things
things like alchemy are actually interesting and intuitive
you need to learn to read
beautiful on low settings

cons
game gets way too easy when you level up even in hardcore
economy allows you to get rich way to fast even in hardcore

performance
the game doesn't perform bad, as you are always above 30 fps and given that the game is slow paced and cinimatic you do not need 60 fps but do not expect to put the game on ultra with ANY RIG as the games engine bottlenecks the fps at around 60-70 on rigs that cost over 5 thousand us dollars.  for a medium to lower speck rig expect to get around 40-50 fps but 30 in laggy areas.  

DO NOT RUN THE GAME ON HIGH OR ULTRA SETTINGS...the game's engine cannot handle it and the game looks no different on higher settings.  they say ultra, however the difference is not viewable at all...only thing that makes a difference is the high resolution texture pack put out by the devs for those high end rigs, however i can run it with a 970m 2gb version with 16 gb of ram and an i7 6850 and i have everythign on medium and many things on low and get 40fps.  a rig with an i7 6850 64gb of ram and 2 bridged 1080tis with 8gb a piece should expect 50 fps on high settings.  there are many settings that have no visual affect that have a major performance decrease and many people do not have optimal settings with high end rigs as they think they can just run it at max and are upset when the dont get above 60 fps with everythign on ultra in a game with an engine that cannot handle that framerate.",True

"An FPS refresh, because it has gone to the basics! Old school fps players will definetly like it: hordes of enemies, huge bosses, power ups scattered in levels like in old games, a lot of variants of  only 2 weapons.
Interesting upgrade system with ingame interface.
No cover system, no automatic aim, no special ops kind of tactic.... just run and shoot with guns blazing :-P wich is awesome!

Kind of linear story, a bit confusing, but a nice atmospheric visuals and backgrounds with a comic design feel (even on DX 9.0c), for a low budget game and a new game engine!
No DX 11 with huge tesselation (which i apreciate ), bots are squared and badly painted, :D, but will give a lot of killer hugs, and hot shots plasma candies!

"I got this game during early access at full price and played a good amount of survival, but honestly didn't find too much replayability out of it - was really hoping for a varied/unique campaign.

Shame on me.

The campaign they've been hyping up for the past year is finally released, and it feels extremely unpolished. The tech tree is punishing, storyline is non-existent and hero units feel like a complete afterthought - amongst a myriad of other issues.

The survival mode is decent, but I wouldn't pay >$15 for it. I suggest waiting for a deeper sale or a couple months of polish.

I have spent hours perfecting strategies to beat bosses in this game, and I have been incredibly frustrated.

Look, if you love LFD, then you'll like this reskin. But if, like me, you are at best ""meh"" about LFD, then this is just more of the same, which, imo, isn't good at all. There are so many other games that do this genera better.",False

"I honestly think this is one of the better game on the f2p shooter market in the West. There's something things that need serious adjustments such as. I will do a list of Pros and Cons below:

PROS:

- Large emphasis on esport competiton via ESL
- Weapon customization system is the greatest thing I've seen in F2P FPS to date.
- Obtaining kills isn't super easy so it feels rewarding when you pull of a Multi/Ultra kill.
- The daily reward system. As of now gems are being given away as a daily reward. As I stated before gems are the real world currency used to buy crates, skins, guns.
- The amount of game modes to choose from is excellent.
- Maps are well designed for competitive play at least from the Search & Destroy point of view.
- Having a A WORKING MATCHMAKING SYSTEM in an F2P FPS 
- User Interface is easy to navigate
- A WORKING LEADERBOARD
- The hideout (Combat record, or player card equivalent) has a large amount of stats to look over to see how well you've been performing.
- Aiming down your sights actually works use it > hip fire. learn HOW and WHEN to do both.

Cons: 

The Shop:
-  LOW GUN SELECTION. Game just came out more will be added sooner or later. 
-  Most of those guns on the market must be purchased via gems which is the real world currency for the game. Not enough to players are going to play long enough to buy those guns without a larger selection of guns purchasable through in game currency.
-  There needs to be paint skins and other items that can be purchased permanently. It's a f2p game players like flashy items, the GP items obviously should be less fancy.
-  Not enough cosmetic items for characers.  it's early.

In game: 
-  There needs to a larger incentive for players to play the object, in object based game modes. Players tend to just go for kills in Search and Destroy rather than planting or defusing because it's obviously easier, but there isn't a large exp reward for planting or defusing, grabbing the flag in CTF, etc.
-  NERF THE KRISS THERE IS NO WAY A SMG SHOULD HAVE THAT TIGHT OF A SPREAD WITH A FIRE RATE THAT HIGH OP
-  BOOST GP RATES PLAYERS ARE NOT GOING TO BE ATTRACTED TO BUYING AN OVERPRICED 3DAY WEAPON
-  Personally I think the red outline of enemies should be removed from the game as whole not just a rule that can be adjusted by the room host, but that is opinion based. 
- MORE MAPS

Matchmaking: 
-  Advertise Matchmaking, the system is nice there needs to be more players drawn to it.
-  There should be a UI that shows how much you progress in Matchmaking.
-  REWARD PLAYERS FOR PLAYING MATCHMAKING

Overall it's a new game, the developers are going to need time and patience to improve the game. It has lot's of potential to be a good F2P FPS. If you're looking for a shooter that you don't need to put in 3k+ hours to be decent at and still want to play competitively this is a game that deserves to be given a shot.",True
"After years passing, Fallout 3 is still being purchased and played throughout the globe! Reason why? This game is LONG, and once complete, you want to restart and play it again. A Phenomenal creation by Bethesda and looking forward to their next game!",True
"Across multiple accounts. Spanning across roughly 1500 hours. This game is always here for me. I normally rotate through games in seasons, play Rust for a month, play League for a month, maybe Overwatch for a month. Very few games do I re-cycle through with, one of those games is CSGO, up with my most played games of all time It tops the list with the most money I've thrown into. The learning curve is great, competitive atmosphere and balancing are great, along with a far advanced movement system that allows custom game modes like Surfing, BHOP, and many other iconic modes. This game, that is now free, is very well optimized, and will provide infinite amounts of entertainment to you and your friend group. Only problem right now is with hackers in lobbies but the games you don't get them are always enjoyable. I don't know why you are reading reviews, just download the game with friends and if you cant figure it out, watch some youtube videos on it to introduce you to the movement as it is weird.",True

"I played this after seeing my friend talk about it. I found it on steam and decided to give it a shot. Overall, Catherine is a really great game and I'd definitely recommend it.

The story is fairly engaging, and the bar segments are a nice little break from the challenge of the nightmare stages. Helping out the patrons move through their problems is really satisfying, and it makes you feel that you have personally had an impact on their character growth by being their support. The main plot line has an interesting mechanic of being influenced by your answers to the confessional questions, and certain dialogue options. In my first playthrough, I decided to go with as many 'good' options as I could, and landed myself with the Katherine true ending. Currently, I'm working through the game again to get a Catherine ending.

However: even playing on the lowest difficulty, there are some issues in the nightmare stages. The main example being Stage 5, where the skill curve seems to shoot into the god damn stratosphere. This caused me to be... extremely frustrated. Despite this, though, overcoming those extremely challenging stages allowed for an even more gratifying victory... only to move onto the S5 Boss Stage. 

Dear God.

Overall, a great game, but if you get easily frustrated, I recommend playing on a lower difficulty, or taking a bunch of breaks during the frustrating stages. Trust me, you'll need 'em.",True

Dernière partie : Juillet 2019.
Ce jeu reprend le principe de la défense de tours et l'inverse complètement : on incarne l'attaquant et il faut planifier par quel chemin passer jusqu'aux différents objectifs. Si sur les premières missions on peut construire son escouade et tracer en ligne droite jusqu'à l'objectif, l'avancement du scénario forcera à utiliser les différentes forces et faiblesses des unités et des tours adverses à bon escient pour finir le jeu.
Un très bon jeu qui propose une jouabilité propre et agréable au premier abord, et qui peut proposer un défi important dans les modes de difficulté plus élevés.
Côté succès : la plupart seront obtenus au fil du jeu. Certains vous forceront à refaire la campagne dans un mode de difficulté supérieur (mais raisonnable), mais le plus rare vous demandera connaissance, précision et chance pour l'obtenir (basé sur l'aléatoire).

This game takes tower defense principles and completely reverses it : we are the attacker and it needs to plan which path to take to get to the different objectives. If on first missions we can build a squad and go straight to the goal, story progress will force to correctly use strengths and weaknesses of units and enemy towers to finish the game. A very good game which offers polished and enjoyable gameplay first, and which can propose a great challenge in higher difficulty levels.
About achievements : most of them will be obtained by playing the game. Some will ask to replay campaign in a higher difficulty (but still doable), but the rarest will require knowledge, accuracy and some luck to get it (RNG based).",True

"So on my first playthrough I had gotten to a terror mission. There is a disc and some drones trying to kill some civilians and XCOM won't be having that. The only way for my squadmember to save two cavilians from getting annihialted by a disc is to use run & gun to get there and kill the disc before it kills the two civilians. Squaddie runs, but right before he takes his shot two Chryssalids appear. He destroys the disc with his last shell in the tube the turn before it was about to kill the two civilians, but one of the Chryssalids charges straight at him.

My sniper luckily was on point and managed to hit the charging chryssalid before it made it's way to my squaddie as well as land a shot on the other at the beginning of the next turn - not enough to kill the deman thing. Unfortunately, the charging chryssalid was still able to hit and poison him. He had one bar of health left, no shells left in his shotgun, and the medic was halfway across the map. There was no way that my squaddie was going to be able to make it to the squad medic before the poison ended his life.

There was however, one option left. He pulled the pin in his grenade, vaporizing the two weakened chryssalids. Walker's selfless actions saved two lives from the maws of the chryssalids that day. Eventually XCOM had successfully repelled the alien threat.

The sacrafices these toy soldiers make will be burned into your memory. When high ranking important squad mates die, you really feel it. No other series out there really captures the same feel. You're doing yourself a disservice if you don't at least give this game a try. Worth full price, it's highway robbery on sale. Get XCOM: Enemy Within. Play it first, it is basically the base game with even more layers of depth - not just an additional story.",True

"I love me some swamps and trolls. I always found them bogs mesmerizing, bumped into these while being a little bit lost in the forest with my friend a couple of times. That shit's even creepier in real life, even during daytime and without them monsters. But, sadly, even a swamp can't salvage this gameplay, which exhausted me in less than an hour.
Basically, you tediously run around collecting stuff to move the plot, sometimes things happen, just like in that slenderman trash. The things themselves are okay, Swedish folklore is much better than them spooky urban memes, and the price is real low, but none of it could justify the slog to me.

"I had a blast with DEX. Good story, if a bit cliche with characters, it kept me playing to find out what would happen next and what new characters I would meet. Different ways to handle the quests, you can usually do a good or bad scenario. Once I got the hang of the hacking parts it was very easy. Shame the lead designer/writer of DEX passed away a couple years ago, I would of liked to see what his next game would be. If you like Cyberpunk, this is a must buy.

"Unlike other games of this genre, Salt is focused on exploration rather than survival, and it's great. You'll sail across a huge ever-expanding procedurally generated world looking for loot, hunting, fishing, fighting pirates, discovering ruins, customizing your ship and crafting new gear to help you on your journey. 

Every Salt game starts the same: you wake up on an island with no enemies, a journal, a basic crafting guide, all items you need to build your first boat, weapon and pickaxe. What's next? Engage the high seas and discover! 

As other players have said, this game is very relaxing and feel almost therapeutic. Kudos to the sound designer; all ambience sounds are top notch and very immersive. There's music too, but it only plays at the right times, like when you're on deep sea with angry waves, discovering something completely new, etc.

While the graphics are cartoonish, the lighting is very realistic. The sunset in this game is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen on a videogame. It's so beautiful that you'll want to stop everything you're doing just to admire the view. Another element that means a lot in your experience is the waves. They feel like real waves, reacting to the wind with unpredictable patterns. You really feel you're sailing into the unknown as you see your last visited island disappearing and with nothing in front of you. You can craft a sextant or look for a compass to help you find your localization.

The downside of this game is that you can't explore underwater, there's only one biome and there's no weather changes. The good thing is that new biomes and dynamic weather are already planned and are coming soon. To know more about what's planned and the stage of development you can read the devs development blog (http://saltthegameblog.blogspot.com). Every friday they post something new. Worth the read even if you don't own the game.

If you don't know if you might like Salt, download the demo. There's little limitation on the demo (you can't go very far, can't use world seeds and can't play on hardcore mode), so you can almost feel like you're having the full experience. If you enjoyed what you played, buy and support the devs. When you launch the game you'll notice that you can continue your adventure from where you left on the demo. How awesome is that?

All in all, I recommend Salt for everyone looking for a relaxing experience. You can play without worrying of dying (you respawn every death) or you can play in hardcore mode with permadeath to see how far you can go. Don't be turned off by the cartoonish graphics. There's an incredible game here. Try the demo and see for yourself.",True
"What do say about this game.. Well for starters you are better off playing PUBG than this steaming pile of poop.

I will be freeing up some much needed space on my hard drive and will be playing something form EA Games.

**Update 22 April 2019**

I have to admit that this game as improved a lot over the past few months i still would not recommend this game at this full price, but maybe during a Steam Summer or Winter sale. I would recommend this game over anything form EA Games at this point.",False

Nice expansion,True
This game comes after KotOR II in alphabetical order.,True
"Extremely fun game that will satisfy both the casual and competitive player.  Replayability is nearly infinite. The skill gap among players is enormous which provides a challenge and incentive to improve.  Matchmaking is very good at ensuring you are playing among your skill level.  As for toxicity, it mostly exists in players leaving matches at the first sign of defeat or spamming messages in the quick chat.  Neither of these issues are of much significance due to AI teammates and chat bans.  This game never fails to improve my mood.",True

"A game about robots taking over the world, man vs machine, and infiltrating a Japanese robot company. You lead an international team of solders in a 3rd person shooter with interesting AI co-op support that adds a twist to your standard shoot-em-up. Better than i expected for such an old game. The graphics were great!!

Things i liked:
- engaging story with an urgency to keep playing to the next level
- auto save and restore made gameplay smooth without interruptions even after failing a challenge
- the many mini-challenges are varied and decent, like staying balanced, and hit the key at the right time, no puzzle solving
- various bosses were fun
- good range of characters, if a bit stereotypical
- interplay with different team members, can choose different ones at select points
- voice acting is top notch!
- cinematography for a game was wow! 5 stars!
- facial animation in cut scenes is great, they were worth watching and made for a good attempt at an emotional side-story

The voice command system is really innovative. It allows you to control other team members, sometimes. Half the time they ignore your direction. Answering team member questions using your voice also builds ""trust"", which changes the ending of the game. Even though it only worked about 50% of the time, i still enjoyed playing with this feature. Good they put a diagnostic tool in the game to check how well your voice will work with the game. Run that to calibrate some basic thresholds.I couldn't work out how to select voice commands using the keyboard (tab key brings up the choices).

About 10 hours game play start to finish with a fulfilling ending. It is very linear though, you can't get lost. Some parts of the game cleverly disorientate you though with camera perspective, shaking, and smoke. So that was fun. 

Console port to PC was not so great. Controls for example didn't always feel right and on-screen keys shown are not correct. For example ""M"" means pressing the scroll wheel button 3 on my mouse in some cases, and <<<< actually means A. And who uses F and Q for going back?!

Great game to play over a weekend and feel fulfilled about blasting tons of evil robots.

TIP - If you can't launch the game a second time, delete ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Binary Domain\savedata\UserCFG.txt"" and start it again with the native resolution of your screen. I used my embedded graphics on my laptop instead of the graphic card and it was fine at max graphics settings.",True
"A testimony to what can be accomplished by a small team of people when they have a great idea, and passion within them.

This title is a classic earthbound style Role-Playing Game but with an added twist - every single enemy in the game (including bosses) can be spared. No monster has to die. This is done with an extra menu available i combat where you may speak to the enemies and convince them to not kill you. This creates a warm, hilarious atmosphere, although it is not afraid to give you powerful, emotional sequences as well. One of the endings spooked me for sure, showing how masterfully crafted the narrative of the game is, as it delves into many genres. 

From the first seconds of this title, the player is thrust into an unknown world. They are greeted with charm, and that charm stays with them the whole way through. Toby Fox has written dialogue of such calibre never before seen in video game format. Every character has a distinct style when they speak, every character has a different comedic device they use, even if it is just a simple minion. From the bumbling baddie, the kind caring mother, or even a wiggling pile of gelatin, the different people you encounter ooze charisma.

I went into the game expecting a short, but fun, experience and boy was I surprised when I found that there was more content than I originally thought. With three different endings (neutral, genocide, and true pacifist), there is some unexpected replay value, that takes every single battle of the game into account. In fact, some bosses will not be fought in every playthrough, showing just how much choice the player truly has. This is something that has been tried again and again in RPG's, but in my opinion hasn't been done as skillfully since Chrono Trigger.

Although the writing and combat is the true drawing factor of Undertale, the score and scenery are no slouch either. The art style for all adversaries is distinct, and jaw-dropping. The game takes pixelated graphics to a level I had yet to see, and when it diverts from the pixel look at a certain part of the finale it is done in such a manner that it leaves you feeling exactly how it should. The soundtrack of this game pulls you into all of the emotional scenes, and I am not ashamed to admit that the culmination of sound and writing brought tears to my eyes in the final minutes of the game. A particular favourite of mine was Undyne's theme which is filled with the urgency, power, and duty of the character.

Overall, Undertale was a quick but entirely satisfying game that I implore all to play. This is what the Steam platform has helped create, wonderful indie developements that get the game out there for all to play. Do not miss out on this exquisite experience. Undertale is an instant classic that should be held up as a triumph of comedic Role-Playing Games.",True

"I've been playing this game since about a month after it came out (thought it doesn't look like it cause I played on console, but that's not the point.) I can say that this game has a lot to offer. Unlocking new operators is satisfying after saving up for them for so long. After you get them all, you will be saving up for new weapon skins, new uniforms, and new headgears. Playing casual is pretty fun, and when you have a squad to play with it's even better. You can have a lot of fun times on customs or casual or even ranked. And ranked is intense, but it's fun. Though there are not many settings on customs, there are still a lot of community-designed gamemodes (e.g. hide-and-seek or michael myers) that you can play with your friends. The entire community is its fair share of toxic and friendly. I would 100% recommend this game to you and your friends.",True
"PEW PEW PEW!!!!!!

"I'm into this game for about 4 hours now and I can clearly paint a picture of what I am dealing with here, and it is not pleasant. I will categorize my praise and critisism as far as possible - hopefully without losing focus.

[b]Game menue[/b] - Skip if not interested. But it gives you an initial idea of how lazy this port was.
a) Graphics
In the graphics menue you will be surprised to find only a choice of resolutions which will all leave your view narrow. With no option to manipulate FOV, since it is not for you to change, this sensation intensifies and gives even me headaches. And I honestly never had problems with FOV before this game - never felt I needed a slider. Additionally, you are able to change minor settings (depth of field, bloo, ""high quality decals"" - I'll get into this later) which are merely cosmetic but the developers do not seem to trust you with relevant stuff like AA or filtering. You can change your Vsync option, though.
b) Audio
You will be faced by two possibilities: change your SFX and music volume. That's it. No way turning on subtitles, no choice of sound quality whatsoever. This is just poor!
c) Controls
While you are able to change certain buttons, you will find yourself in the situation, that *reload* and *use* are assigned to one and the same button. No way of changing that. I am asking: Why? We own keyboards with more buttons than only 12. Laziness strikes again! There also seems to be a rudimental port option featuring aim assist. Other than that, there is no way to lie down or to check a box if you want to be in ironsights permanently or while clicking the RMB.

[b]Game world[/b]
First of all, I have to mention the horrible texture work all over the game, [spoiler] especially when you're in the year 2010 and see abandoned structures [/spoiler]. This and the fact that some textures are not in place at all makes me furious about the obviously lazy devs. I would, without joking, compare those textures to Half Life 1, which came out in 1998! Remember, that Singularity came out a few months after Metro 2033 in 2010. Neither from an atmospheric nor a graphical aspect I can't understand people who compare those games. They have nothing in common. In fact, it is an insult for the devs of A4 Games. 
I mean, Singularity has its atmospheric peaks here and there ([spoiler] e.g. research labs, bug's layer [/spoiler]) but they are immediately destroyed by following ""level design choices"". I am talking about absent dynamic lights or objects (not even a flashlight, [spoiler] which every modern soldier should have [/spoiler]), washed-out sky textures, which look frozen and unreal and cheap weather effects (e.g. rain). 
It's the same with the leveldesign. It is okay for the most part, nothing extraordinary. But there are so many moments where you will encounter unfinished structures and missing details (e.g. cut-off cables stop mid air and aren't modelled correctly). Unfortunately, there is some kind of physics engine, which is presented rarely. But when you encounter it, boxes will be flying around if you touch them or objects will get stuck and so on. It is super frustrating and happens at random! Other objects, like curbs, debris, bunsen burner nets, door handles, etc block you constantly. Mid-fight this is deadly and overall it is very disturbing to just get stuck in the middle of a room. You will get stuck randomly 1/3 rooms on average. 
This brings me to the games linearity (LOTS of poorly scripted events though), which does not have to be a bad thing. But this games crams it so far down your throat, that you just want to spit out. Invisible walls every other step, you aren't allowed to jump simple obstacles (like railings), there is no back tracking (doors magically close, invisible walls appear, etc) and there is massive hand holding, when following a fellow NPC. Just terrible and annoying. Unexcusable. On the other hand, you might be allowed to wander off the trail for a few paces: Take a corridor with several doors and one additional opens up for you to have ammo, health or E99 (coming to that later). So, searching in a very limited fashion is rewarded and present. 

[b]Fighting/Guns/Enemies[/b]
The game is a FPS in a classic fashion which has a focus on arcade gameplay (lots of medipacks, ammunition, buffs, guns, loads of enemies) that reminded me of Serious Sam and Wolfenstein at moments (just the arcade aspect!). If this was executed well, I would not have a problem with that. But the main thing that is terrible, is the KI. Enemies move as slow as if they were in slow motion, they run into walls for seconds and can see you through same. Why [spoiler] soldiers from 1955 have the same guns as soldiers from 2010 [/spoiler] will stay a mystery to me. Many enemies ([spoiler] mutants and monsters [/spoiler]) are literally bullet sponges, including bosses - this is just something you should avoid, except for boss fights. They spice up the gameplay! 
At least there is variation in enemy design (at least optically), but fighting feels dull. You can wait in any corner you like for enemies to approach and pick them off one by one (dying animations do not vary a lot with most enemies) without being in real danger. It only gets dangerous when you need to heal, because you will slow down even more (yes, sprinting feels like you are dragging your boots through mud) and only heal 33% of your helath with a forevertaking animation, often leading to death by default. 
Besides standard guns (shotgun, pistol, assault rifle, etc), there are specials. One of which is the time traveling glove (see below) nourished with [spoiler] newly discovered [/spoiler] atoms (called E99), which also serve as a means of payment for upgrades. Yes, you actually can upgrade yourself (health boost, accuracy, etc - also from blueprints you find) and your guns, which is an admirable system, although it has been in games (Dead Space) before. But a nice feature nonetheless. Unfortunately, weapon sounds and animations are not at the technical level of 2010 when the game came out and sound/look just awful (again: HL1 like). 

[b]Story[/b] - pretty much a spoiler!
[spoiler] The idea of time travelling has been done, of course, but I don't think, there was ever an approach comparable to this game. It is a great idea with nice implementations like portals (rip in the space-time continuum) and even little puzzles. Not like in Portal or Talos Principle of course, but I wished for something more like Half Life 2, since your time traveling glove can lift objects, drain enemies lifes, push them away, etc. Speaking of the ""push effect"" (basically an EMP) I need to say that it feels just so weak. Humans are pulverised into pieces which is surprising and satisfying, but mutants and monsters are merely pushed away a few meters. This is disappointing to say the least. The story in its entirety feels urged and flimsy. The voice acting does its part, because the actors often exeggarate and overemphasize their speaking parts. Stuff like letters, protocols, tape recorders or even movies try to keep the player interested but fail most of the time. The movies are the only thing interesting and even funny to an extent. [/spoiler]

Now the tough question after all that what feels like negative superiority. Would I recommend it? There is just so much clunky mechanics and minor mistakes combined with visible laziness that adds up to an infuriating melting pot of emotions. On the other hand, if you are only out for mindless and average designed FPS action, this might be something for you. As I expected more of this game, especially because of its praise in magazines and by other players, I can not recommend it. There is just too much missing, which I saw in games like Metro 2033, Half Life 2 or other story driven experiences with a character of linearity. I am not gonna put points on this game, because interest of players might differ too much.",False

The most disappointing part of all though was the realization that this isn't open world like the tag says. You seem to only get to load into areas for timed missions and I was hoping more for a free range do your own thing and explore map.

"Yeah, it is somewhat buggy. Graphical wise, it lacks texture quality and other bells and whistles, at least for now, until patch if it'll come.

But the game is extremely FUN. Especially in split-screen hotseat, on high level of difficulty. I played it with girlfriend for the most part, and we enjoyed it all - from story legend to nightmare log.

"I can't recommend this game in any way shape or form. That 2.1 hours of playtime? I haven't played a single minute. What I did do was spent 2.1 hours wrestling with UPlay, downloading updates for it, updates for the game itself, putting product keys into Uplay, putting product keys into the game, then being kicked out of the game to download the expansion pack, more Uplay connection issues and eventually when I managed to get into the game I get spammed with offers to play whatever ""free""-to-play garbage they're vomiting at me and asked to complete a product survey.

This shouldn't be on Steam. Pretty much every other Steam game, regardless of the developer, integrates soundly, downloads DLC easily and doesn't require multiple logins to different services just to play the game. Just awful. I deeply regret purchasing this, and a copy for my wife so we could play multiplayer. I shudder to think of what horrors await those who would try to establish a multiplayer session.

"It’s hard to believe that the first Ghost Recon title is over a decade and a half old, and it’s equally shocking to think that it’s been nearly five years since the most recent entry, Ghost Recon: Future Soldier. Other Tom Clancy titles have helped fill in that gap, but the typically excellent Ghost Recon sub-franchise has laid dormant. With Wildlands, it’s most certainly back, but it’s almost unrecognizable. Surprisingly, that’s not nearly as dire as it might sound. 

Like most of the Ghost Recon series, Wildlands throws you into a troubled, war-torn land that is absolutely overrun with bad guys who need to be dispatched as efficiently as possible. This time around the action takes place in the South American country of Bolivia. Plenty of artistic liberty has been taken with both the landscapes and politics of the region, but the game does its best to fit the story arc into something resembling modern-day world affairs. Thankfully, you’ll be too busy flying helicopters, rescuing rebels, and sniping heavily armed cartel members to care how well it pulls that off. 


From the very first seconds of initial mission it’s made clear who your final target is: El Sueño. El Sueño is the top boss and leader of the Santa Blanca cartel, which holds control over the entire region thanks to the massive wealth generated by its thriving cocaine business. Every single thing you do in Wildlands is ultimately just another small step towards finally taking El Sueño down, and even if you pause your story missions for a bit to take care of some side quests, those objectives are still linked to the overarching goal of putting ‘the Boss of Bosses’ six feet under. 

Wildlands is an open-world game in every sense of the word, with complete freedom of movement and frequent clashes with both cartel members and nefarious local law enforcement, which also happens to be extremely corrupt. You’re given total control to approach each objective the way you want, whether that means stealthily stalking a jungle hideout while sniping militants or driving a farm tractor into a military base and lobbing grenades at everything that moves. Sometimes stealth is necessary to survival, but other times doing your best impression of Rambo is not only extremely effective, but also a whole lot of fun.",True

Initially story seems rather simple for first few missions, then it gets very interesting as you begin to thought there's not much left.  The interesting ways to overcome a challenge while controlling multiple characters to proceed in our mission makes it very engaging. Sometimes it gets difficult to come up with a strategy, but eventually taking small steps helps finishing the mission and not like we will be stuck forever. The different skill set of different characters came handy in their own way to succeed. Not to forget the Japanese theme, and the beautiful graphics with different locations for different missions makes it look gorgeous.

"Cautionary thumbs up!

Buyer Beware, if the demo is running OK for you, absolutely expect it to run a few pegs worse, as was the case for me.

Even with scaling back settings here and there, things only get rockier (and chopier) as you progress into newer levels and larger areas.  This game STILL has pretty serious performance issues, even when running on ""just"" an i7 7700K and gtx 1080, at a mere 1080p (anyone claiming perfect performance on all ultra settings, with much lower end hardware, is simply trolling, or simply from a another dimension, I guarantee it, don't let em fool you, come on now) 

It's fun, it's pretty, but the PC port really is as wonky as ""they"" say, and I've been able to run it on a few different hardware configurations, and results were all very much in line with the various complaints and issues people were having.  Though when running it on ""lower end"" hardware, you quite badly need to scale the settings back.  It's pretty ridiculous, and honestly, a little pathetic, as this should NOT be a problem on PC's ranging in the $1,000+ range.  There are a few tricks you can pull, but they tend to have inconsistent and/or marginal results (lowering pre-rendered frames settings, lowering AA settings, increasing CPU priority) but they can, and do help.

It can be a ""pretty cool guy"" of a game, I like the art and world very much, but definitely keep in mind, the demo is designed to get you to pull the trigger on purchasing the full game, and does run noticeably better than the retail version does in the same areas, which I do find to be somewhat of a dirty move, and needs to be addressed.  I'm surprised no one is making a point of this at all, as this can be perceived as a low blow by some, and I do definitely find it in poor taste, and has caused me to lose a fair amount of confidence in Arkane studios for pulling such a maneuver.  Not to mention, they've decided to release an extension of this game, yet still haven't fully remedied and polished up the PC port.  They should have spent some of that time fixing it up a little more, or does that sound crazy? 

I give it 1/3rd of a thumb, out of a whole thumb up, which is still a technical thumbs up, if somewhat of a lesser one, if that makes any sense, and I think it does, in keeping with Steams thumb-centric rating system.  Despite the bizarre performance issues, that really do require you to look past, and simply pretend aren't there.  Though the way this game portrays sticking a sword through someone's face really is strangely satisfying, not to mention extremely therapeutic.",True
"Rust is a very unique game. The skill ceiling is as high as YOU make it, before buying the game make sure you know someone who has already played the game, and or has played some sort of survival game. As spawning on the beach naked alone and with your rock is very annoying. without the help of other players you will die, over and over and over and over again. People in this game are generally not friendly so if you see players when you stand up RUN. The best thing you can do as a new player is look for low pop servers and get ""good"" on there. Then start slowly working your way up on higher pop servers, even me with my thousands of hours struggle at some points in a wipe on MAIN servers as it is the BEST of the BEST on it.

"It's a good game. Not very good or flawless, just good. Like a 6.75 out of 10. The controls are smooth and the gameplay is very fast-paced and enjoyable, and the weapons combined with the various temporary power-ups are very satisfying to use. The core gameplay is right where it should be. Jumping between platforms and blasting through waves of enemies just feels right, and that's where DUSK really shines when it comes to emulating the feel old-school shooters. 

Now, I do have some complaints too. The levels are okay. The layout is usually nice and makes sense in terms of what the game tries to accomplish. But there are some rather annoying elements in some levels as well. Sometimes your flashlight breaks and you have to walk around pretty much blindly in complete darkness. Imagine playing Quake blindfolded. There are some ""secrets"" that doesn't make much sense either. Some are in plain sight and sometimes even placed somewhere you need to go in order to progress. It felt like there's an abundance of secrets within secrets. I thought secrets were supposed to be more, you know... secretive? Now that doesn't mean that there aren't any good secrets in the game. It'll take me a while to 100% this game. Some of them just didn't make too much sensse. The soaps are a nice touch though.

My biggest problem with this game is probably the look of most of the enemy sprites. They make the game feel more like a modern mod for an old game, rather than a straight up old-school FPS. The fluid gameplay and satisfying gunplay that is so on-point gives me a weird ambivalent feeling whenever I see a bunch of these goofy looking enemies, constantly reminding me that it's just a game made in the late 2010's trying to emulate something out of nostalgia. They could've put some more work into them, or maybe get someone else to create the enemy sprites entirely. I can see how they probably are the hardest part to get right too, since they need to have animations and fitting sounds as well. Oh, speaking of the sound design; it's probably one of the strongest points of the game. Great soundtrack by Hulshult which is the perfect backdrop for mowing down hordes of enemies.

Overall the game feels like a mixed bag of a lot of the 90's era shooters. More than often I found myself thinking ""oh this reminds me of Blood"" or ""Redneck Rampage"". It's usually minor details in the game, or just the look of a level in general. For instance, when I first saw the turrets I thought they looked directly ripped out of Duke 3D. 

That being said, I do recommend this game. For the pricetag it's great value for money. After running through all three episodes in 9 hours (you can probably do it in less than 8 if you don't spend too much time looking for secrets during your first playthrough) I do feel the urge to 100% it. The multiplayer is probably loads of fun with friends too, if only I had enough friends who owned the game. Feels bad.",True

The tension builds but with a calmness that relaxes at the the same time if that makes any sense.

"Absolutely loved this game. And to be honest, there's not a single bad thing about this game, it has an amazing and smooth combat system and lots of different weapons and combos which never cease to amaze you with their unique abilities and appearance, finding a weapon in this game is the equivelant of finding gold IRL. The story is the main attraction of this game in my opinion, every single Chapter/Arc makes you question everything you have done up until that point and it even makes you question stuff in real life. All 3 main endings really hit home and the journey to get to each main Ending really is something else, an emotional rollecoaster is one way to describe it i guess but thats not a fair description because it's not like every part of the story is sad, every part of the story has cute interactions between characters, mainly between 2B and 9S which help the player connect to those characters as their little remarks/joking around humanizes these androids in a way. It's a very compelling story, once it hooks you in you just wanna know more and more about NieR:Automata's world, i found myself reading all the lore in the Menu trying to figure out more and more about the world, and the fun part is that a lot of different items/weapons contain lore so the game kind of pushes you to look for items and secret paths which contain secret chests so you can find out more.Even the side quests in this game are worth taking, i found myself in the first route getting bored out of side quests but after giving them another shot on the second route i found them to be fun for the most part, whether its a weird ninja machine that wants you to battle it as ""training"" or grabbing an item for your operator from the desert as a gift it was pretty fun just for all the different interactions with all these different and unique characters. Of course some side quests are a hassle and make you run around like crazy which gets annoying pretty quickly but for the most part even side quests are fun in this game.Lastly I'd like to say, the costumization in this game is absolutely beautiful, i found myself swapping in and out chips to find the most optimal chip set for my character multiple times, i'd spend half an hour at a time formulating the best chip set, really love this instead of your average ""level up strength"" type of attributes system.

"I cannot recommend this game at all in its current state. When I first started playing Kingdom Come: Deliverance, I was enjoying it.

The combat was Difficult, but it was fair, and takes time to get used to. The rest of the gameplay whether it was walking around and exploring, riding your horse, and what have you was a nice experience. The story was OK. It fit the atmosphere of the game quite well, and I love me some midieval storytelling. The music was nice as well. 

Then while I was doing some quests, I ran into an Infinate loading screan bug three times. However when I loaded from a previous save, I was able to progress the first two times. Then I ran into the glitch again while doing the quest Nest of Vipers. I tried loading from a previous save, Nothing. I tried restarting the quest from a different save point, and still nothing. I tried a few fixes I found online, nothing. The only option left was to restart fourteen hours of this game with a different character It was at that moment when I just gave up. My reasoning for this is what happens when you run into this bug again at any random point during the game again, and you have no other option but to restart?

"I went through 3 characters after a streak of bad luck. My 4th character has shown me that this game truly shines amongst others in it's genre. Patience and determination will get you far.
Everything in this game is very realistic. If you fall from a high height, you can break a limb. If you eat something bad, you can get sick and die. You can bleed out, if not treated. You dont know the intention of other players, so there's always a sense of being watched. Evironments are very well done (aside from not bieng able to run up hills, but the game IS in alpha); I have my settings to High and it's absolutlely breath taking. The sounds of floor boards creaking, the wind, rain, birds, you name it; it's the level of detail you'd expect from a triple A title. 
All of these little touches that most other games don't think about, this game does. Nothing in DayZ is sugar coated. 
This game will change the way you think about the zombie apocalypse
THIS. IS. AS. REAL. AS. IT. GETS. 
It's only downside currently is that zombies do not have collision detection. So you could be in the middle of raiding a house, turn a corner and a zombie just phases through the wall. It does add an interesting curve ball to the game. BUT once again, this game IS in Alpha.

I'm through now a couple playthrough and I have to say it is quite a great, violent hide-and-seek game.
I like the idea of randomly generated worlds which we see quite rarely in games although with todays tech it is more than convenient to build certain games to have this feature.
I liked the AI - it payed attention to check out places where they saw some distraction multiple times.
And I liked the touch of horror in some robots - personal favorites are the Landowner and the Scarecrow. It's great when you don't notice it, you hear something from behind and when you turn around suddenly a glowing pumkinhead smiles back at you, you unload your rounds (it would be fun if you could shoot yourself in the leg in such frightening moments if you don't aim right), then it minces you in a couple of blows... Or when you sneak through the forest and then for the first time you hear the landkeeper's scream and you open up your inventory and rather drink up all the brew pretending it will make it go away...
Another funny factor was when robots started to fight each other. In some playthroughs I've got my first weapon+ammo this way.

"Absolutely outstanding!

There have been three generations of Tomb Raider. The originals which brought us amazing puzzles, the reboots which gave us action and the reimaginings which brought the series into the modern era of both storytelling and spectacle of presentation. What a joy it has been to play through these games and what greater joy still I have knowing that the series has evolved into something truly fantastic.

When playing Rise of The Tomb Raider I felt the same thrills I used to feel when I played Uncharted and the same sense of challenge and accomplishment I got when playing the original Tomb Raider series without it being overwhelming. Somehow they also managed to include the same sense of wonderment and amusement I got from Anniversary and the complete sense of visceral joy I got from Tomb Raider 2013 into it as well without making it seem forced or out of place in any way. 

They not only perfected the formula from the 2013 game but they managed to both make it better and leave room for further improvement in the  future without making it seem like it's lacking something this time around. The future looks brighter than it's ever been and I only see great things on the horizon for the series.

This truly was the rise of the Tomb Raider!",True

"[h1][b]DISCLAIMER[/b][/h1]
[b]The review you are about to read is based on my own experience with the game, my judgment, and the rating system! No third party has impacted anything said in this review. This review is also 100% spoiler-free, so you don't need to worry about that either.[/b]

[h1][b]Gameplay and Interaction (16 out of 20)[/b][/h1]
[b]If you've played any first-person shooter ever in your life, you pretty much know what to expect. Considering that this game came out back in 1998, I must say that I didn't expect it to be this playable all these years later. It would not be an overstatement to say that I enjoyed every single mission this game has to offer. While most (if not all) missions were ported to the newer Delta Force games at some point, playing them in the original form only made them better and more enjoyable in every single aspect.

Indeed, some of the gameplay mechanics did not age well, but that's to be expected considering how old the game is. When I found out that there are 40 missions available, I thought that I'd get bored very quickly, but thankfully the way all of the campaign missions are paced made it bearable. I wasn't expecting a perfect game by any means, and I wasn't disappointed with what it had to offer gameplay-wise.[/b]

[h1][b]Graphics and Sound Quality (12 out of 20)[/b][/h1]
[b]I'm pretty sure that there are a ton of other games from the same era that look better and sound better than Delta Force. That's even true today. The only thing that caught my eye in a negative way graphics-wise was the fact that you can't just increase the resolution of the game to make it look cleaner. It does not support higher resolutions and playing the game at 1024x768 on a modern 2560x1440p screen is at times eye bleeding.

Distant objects, and especially soldiers are hard to see most of the time, which makes it a whole lot more difficult to spot certain enemies. Thankfully, bullet tracers are flying all over the place, so at least there's a way to figure out where some of them are coming from. Also, there's this one thing I did not like at all about the sound design and that's these random loops of weapons being shot in the distance. This is especially distracting in situations where you're tasked to eliminate all the enemies in a certain area.

Out of sheer curiosity, I set on a quest to test this out in one of the missions where you're supposed to kill every single enemy in the area. I proceeded by killing every single one of them but left only two soldiers alive in one part of the map. I then moved to higher ground just to see if they're firing their guns. I wasn't at all surprised to find out that none of them were firing, and yet I was hearing bullets coming at me and around me all the time even from locations where there's no one left alive.

There's also this one issue where the sound of footsteps and the gunshots is only being played on one side or not at all. For example, if you're running towards a base full of enemies, you'll only be able to hear the gunshots on the left side, and if you're running the opposite way, all the sound just switches to the right side. Other than that, I also experienced some sound issues where the footsteps or gunshots would not be playing at all, leaving only the visual side of things as the option to spot an enemy.[/b]

[h1][b]Performance and Optimization (13 out of 20)[/b][/h1]
[b]Playing a game that's this old means that there are going to be new issues coming up that weren't present at release. Most people think that the performance and optimization are supposed to only revolve around how smoothly the game runs, but it's a lot more than that. What about stability? Isn't that also how the game perform(ance)s?

Sadly, this game suffers from random crashes and freezes to the point where you must consider doing things like pressing multiple keyboard keys at once very carefully. If you're going to play Delta Force on a modern operating system, here are a few issues I ran into that might be happening to you too. Doing any kind of ALT-TABBING or game window minimizing mid-game is going to break the game.

Sometimes the game just crashes out of the blue even if you do nothing, and pressing multiple keyboard keys at once just freezes and crashes the game at times. Also, if you ALT-TAB out of the game and return to it more than 30 seconds later - sometimes it makes all of the game assets disappear - leaving only the enemy and friendly soldiers visible in a vast open terrain without trees, vehicles, buildings, etc.[/b]

[h1][b]Story and Content Value (20 out of 20)[/b][/h1]
[b]Delta Force offers 40 missions that are spread out across five campaigns. The majority of these missions are very simple, but the majority require some planning. I'm glad that the Rambo style of gameplay does not work here - as that was the case with the two latest releases: Xtreme and Xtreme 2. Friendly soldiers are very useful as well, often killing the entire enemy squads in a heartbeat.

The same can't be said about the later Delta Force releases, where the friendly soldiers are just little puppies running around with non-existent aiming skills. All 40 missions will provide you with specific objectives that you need to accomplish in a certain area, often revolving around the same base and/or location. Thankfully, all of the missions that are based in a single area aren't even slightly the same - which made it all that much more enjoyable to play.[/b]

[h1][b]Animations and Movement Controls (13 out of 20)[/b][/h1]
[b]The animations of some objects aren't great even for the time when the Delta Force was released. For example, jeeps and military vehicles will often hover in the air, tires on them also aren't animated and sometimes don't render at all, etc. As I said, considering that this is an old game, all of this is to be expected. As far as the movement goes, it's a lot better than I expected.[/b]

[h1][b]Final Score and Conclusion (74 out of 100)[/b][/h1]
[b]While Delta Force isn't as perfect as some people are led to believe, I must say that it was nice to experience and see what gamers in the 90s were able to look forward to. Experiencing something like this for the first time is truly a unique experience, and I highly recommend Delta Force to anyone that would like to see how the first-person shooter games played in the 1990s.[/b]",True

"This review contains only information about Solo Play. I played Half-Life 1 and i can tell that this one is much much more aesthetically pleasing.

I'm not sure if all original content is kept in the game, but some things are improved and some stuff is added to the game. I'm looking forward for more remakes from Crowbar Collective or maybe continuation of the story by themselves and creating Half-Life 3 :O

For sure this game will be on sales so if you can't afford it for original price, just wait for sale like i did and save some buck.

- It made me interested in a fandom that I am not even in
- Soundtrack is also just amazing, and it was stuck in my head for hours afterward
- It has a couple Homestuck references that even I understand
- So much stuff to click
- Encourages you to combine really weird stuff by giving you achievements
- Strifes were both quick and fun

- Serpent mini games made me a little stressed
- Did not cause a meteor to land on my house

"First off skyrim is an amazing and utterly addicting game (I've played 150hrs and still havn't finished the main quest). But it isn't perfect like some people make it out to be. It comes fucking close though.

Graphics - 7/10. In fairness it was made in 2011 but even for being made in 2011 it's graphics aren't exactly outstanding, that being said there are mods that would bring this digit to a 9.

Story - 10/10. It's skyrim... wtf did you expect?

Replayability - 9/10. You can do everything in the game with only one character, that being said you do have a max amaount of skill points so you do find yourself experimenting with new characters.

Addictiveness - 10/10. Food needs preparing, baby is crying... srry life skyrim calls!

Combat - 6/10. This is what lets this game down tbh. The difficulty system is just lazy (they increase damage taken and reduce damage inflicted) NO change at all in monster ai. The melee and range combat is simplistic at best if you block you block everything from you front and there is no dodge. Ranged is just, well ulling and letting loose arrows. Magic however is better my only problem is there are too many spells you lose track! There are so many different spells in magic that aid you in combat its amazing. Create a magical shield, magical armor, revive a former monster to fight for you, freeze someone (simply couse you don't like him) shoot starwars style lightning from your fingers then firebolt him off a cliff into oblivion. By far magic feels the most immersing, interesting and complete! But i dont like using magic I would much rather have the same amount of completness invested into melee, also when you use magic its absoluntely overwhelming you've got 10 spells and another 10 shouts on top of that! I didn' think this much in physics class.

Crafting - 9/10. I just made some awesome armour at a forge using the bones of a dragon I just annihalated! Fuck realism!

Overall - 9/10. The story, the crafting, the addictiveness and replayability makes you forget any bad things this game has. In fact I only noticed how shit the cmbat was after playig around with the difficulty and playing Chivalry (great game btw perfect combat, really sets the standard for sword combat games to come). Back to Skyrim, I've never had this much fun with a game and right now it's dirt cheap buy it! If you havent played it you are missing out this is easily the best game I've ever played.",True

"This is a must have for any Steam-user. Not only is the base game fun to mess around with, but there are a -ton- of fun multiplayer modes available online.

"First thing to know is that this game has a different back story to it for each species so in the game at points you will have different conversations for each story aswell as a different minor quest. the gameplay is a cross between rts and just action so if theres an easy fight you can just go in and win but if there is an hard fight you can go in and just fight or you may want to pause it and tactically position your team and their attacks for the battle. it is a long game but it doesnt fall flat you will always be doing something interesting throughout. all the dlc with awaking as en exception will tie into the game so you may actually be doing a dlc quest without realising. the awakening dlc is a good addition to the game, depending on your choice at the end of the base game will determine who you play as in this dlc. awakening can be quite challenging as i found out but it is worth it.",True

when you change armor your whole body changes too, you cant mix and match between different helmets, gauntlets etc.

"I will say, that I purchased this during the winter sale, and was expecting something somewhat polished for online play.  The game is really promising.  No doubt.  It is something I really would like to completely pay for and play.  Unfortunately, I had to refund the game due to server lag and fps issues unrelated to my gaming setup.  I have a mid/ high end rig, that plays recent releases on high settings.   The little gameplay i got out of the game was a little under 3 hours , but most of it was trying to get online to play.   The idea is great here... and, hopefully if a dev reads this, they will work on fixing the server issues immediately.  Otherwise, I feel that there will be more like me who just can't play the game due to server and poor performance issues.   If I can't play, don't expect me to pay.

Hopefully, I can change this review in a few months, after they have ironed out the fps and server lags.  I would really like to play this.

"The first few levels of the game are pretty fun but it turns in to a pretty boring grind.  Because there is only a few base materials to this game, higher level crafting requiers hours upon hours of grinding. New items do not realisticly increase the ability to harvest raw materials at a fast enough rate to compensate for the recipes at mid level.  I didn't even feel like finishing this game it had turned in to such a grind.  On top of that, poor fight mechanics and literally no dodging kinda hurts the exploration.  If I run in to more than one fox its trouble and I cant even kill them because they run away faster than I can run when they get to min health.

"The LESS you know about this game the BETTER your first playthrough will be.
I really enjoyed my first two hours but as you play and replay and learn about the enemies the game becomes less mysterious and can get dull.

Pros:
-Music
-Lovecraftian
-Sound Effects (enemies especially)
-Items/Upgrades that change the way you play.
-Magic abilities and combinations of items are fun to experiment with.
-Enemies and game mechanics
-You can steal items from/kill the shopkeeper
-I liked the minecrafty look, it wont suit everyone though.
-3 Main campaigns with 3 levels each.
-2 extra campaigns, one is 10 levels long and apparently you need to backtrack through to -the start in order to finish the level (i've not played it yet).
-There is an arcade mode of sorts.
-Randomized levels (to an extent)

Cons:
-Once you've learned about the way things work the game gets dull
-No reasons to replay unless you want to get a special ending/achievements.
-As a ""rogue-like"" it's a little too easy to 'game' it and make yourself too powerful. What i mean is you can re-enter previous levels and grind out items and resources (the first level is good for this).
-On top of this the levels only randomize when you actually die so technically you can replay and learn the first levels and grind them with little risk. 
-$15 is too much to ask, get it on sale like i did.
-Not truly random, the levels are made up of blocks/areas which over time you notice are not random. The pieces/areas in the levels (which arent random) are randomly put together, there is still enough variety though.(at first.)


Ultimately its very spooky and fun game to begin with but has little replayability .

"Finally actually got into this game now that 1.0 is out. Ive had it since near the launch of this back in 2014 or whenever, but it wasn't very appealing back then, But now its a whole new world. There is alot to learn, alot to explore and alot to loose. What I can say with my first real and still ongoing play through is this: I was in cherno, a fresh spawn I heard gun shots from the church building in the center of the map. I see a full geared guy at the top, just shooting at nothing and everything. I ask him what he is up to, he says he is bored and just shooting people lol. But for some reason he doesn't shoot me. I add him on discord and he runs me through the ropes, we are buds now heading to electro to kill newbs. I find a mp5 along the way. We finally make it to elekro only to get into a pvp battle with 2 other groups. We die but make it back and both end up snagging a ak and I get a mosin while he picks up a svd. All the clothes are ruined we are forced to carry out ak's like our sweet little babies that they are. We decide to go in land eventually get packpacks to hold our ak's, food, cantienes, the works basically. Finally make it to a town with a military base, called svinsky or something. I go up a hunter tower to swap backpacks, I get shot at but the doodes a pleb and misses. Ok so we load him full of lead and take his useful crap yay. He has pants for me since he ruined mine with bulllet holes, no worries. And we make our way to green mountain or something with a giant tower and logoff til the next time we play. If you are tired of going on 50 player killstreaks or just want a slower more meaningful adventure/pvp experience Dayz is finally at the point where I can endorse in and play it!

AND MY GOD THE FREAMES! I get double the fps I used to and can easily play this game at 1440p. The performace has improved alot with the engine rebuild so definatley check this game out if performance rumors of the past were holding you back. I get 80-120fps with an average of 90 something at 1440p with a mix of medium to ultra settings. On a i5 4690k and 1070 ti. This game also looks beautiful, the scenery, land scape and everything really mixes all together well to make a beautiful forrest land scape.

"Now this used to be a great game. I enjoyed both the first game in the series, and this. although I have to admit I prefer the original over Audiosurf 2.
To be fair, I only have a few hours of playtime, most of it a good while back, and then I decided it would be fun to play it again. Much to my suprise, I amn now forced to play a YouTube video that lags then entire song. (and that is not good when you are playing a presicion game.) 

Wold I recommend the game?
No, Not anymore. I CAN recommend that you play the first game though. Good fun!",False
"What I played so far its a really interesting game. I would consider it a puzzle platformer. You die after one hit, the clue is,  only hazards and enemies kill you. Jumping down a cliff or out of the windows results in the classic labyrinth experience as every border is connected to the level you are playing in. This means that if you go over the border at the right side you appear left, this works with falling, jumping and enemies.

It has a simple story about creation of life, you were made on the sixth day and got the task to collect all the colored crystals to return color to the world. Progress is achieved through buying the next level with your crystals, as you need every crystal to complete a level its a totally fair system. You just have to figure out how to get every crystal without dying as dying resets the level and what you gathered in it.

The music is something experimental, slightly reminding me of Corpse Part during a few parts. There is an option to turn the music off, if you dont like it. Upon death you hear a specific phrase that matches the story.

About the difficulty, I started at easy and will check out the other difficulty levels later. But so far its relaxing (on easy) and sometimes you have to think shortly to get every crystal.

I brought it because it looks interesting and I wanted to support the small developer.
For the asking price its a nice puzzle platformer which I for sure will complete. =)

"The first video advertising Skyhill on the Steam store page makes it seem a lot more fun than it actually is.  I expected a game that would make me think more about the choices I had to make to survive.  I expected more dynamic gameplay (especially from a roguelike).  I expected more replay value (especially from a roguelike).

In reality:

* The gameplay is repetitive.
* In most cases, the decisions you make are obvious.
* The fact that it's a roguelike does not make one playthrough that much different than another playthrough, which means ...
* The replay value is next to nil.

I guess the one positive thing about the game is that the crafting is kind of interesting.  However, you can only perform most of the crafting on the top floor, and, at some point, you're likely to be low enough on food and far enough from a working elevator that the cost of making your way to the top floor simply isn't worth it anymore, meaning better weapons, parts used to restore power to floors, etc. are not craftable for the rest of the playthrough.

"Okay, I'm gonna cut to the details here.
First of all, its a great game (one that I don't actually mind being in early development) especially with all the little features such as management, mass production, and loads more. But on top of small stuff, this game isn't annoying, you can play with friends, you can mod it with out big issues (extremely modular), and it has a great community. Second of all, its worth ever penny. I am very hesitant to buy games in general but since this was another 2d game that came out when most other 2d hype games did, I was even more hesitant to even try it. But after a month of hearing some friends talk about it, I gave it a shot. And since then, I've been playing it often. Now to be honest, I did actually pirate it before getting it, but I felt like an ass for doing that to the developers (who are very nice and hard working with the community) and I went ahead an bought it.

If any one of you is hesitating for any small reason, don't. Its worth it and its very fun. But with all tha being said, get mods, play with friends, and enjoy!",True
"Phil Fish, you are a creative mastermind, but you are also one of the biggest jerks that has ever walked the face of this Earth.

That aside, I absolutely adored this game. The mechanic of 3D shifting with 2D graphics is a concept that works beautifully. Speaking of beautiful, the graphics and music go together wonderfully. If you are a fan of the collect-a-thon theme from Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie, you're going to be in for a treat. Collecting the cubes might not mean anything more than progression, but the puzzles you have to solve to get to these cubes makes it all worth it. The payoff of solving a puzzle feels amazing. I don't really like the fact that there's falling damage in a 2D platformer, but perhaps it's there to reinforce the more laid back nature of the game.

9/10.

Let's start with the story. The storyline of this game is absoulutely AMAZING. It's possibly my most favourite storyline out of any game. You really get to know the characters in an emotional way and the action is insane!
I may only have 20 hours on record but I've completed this game TWICE, and the only reason it's 9/10 is the ending.
No spoilers but the ending truly was dissapointing, the way the game ended was dissapointing. I was so disheartened when I found out you couldn't continue in Free Roam after completing the story. If you wish to Free Roam you have to restart the story which in my opinion was a massive  penisblock.

This is a must have game especially with the Steam sales, I bought this game a long time ago and for the price (now) of the low price of £4.99, BUY THIS GAME! I've also played the DLC but honestly, it doesn't beat the original storyline of Vito Scaletta. It kind of reminds me of the relationship with cousins Roman and Niko Bellic.",True

There is a great peak system in this game along with a decent amount of guns for each side, this game doesn't have a leveling up system that allows you to get more guns or attachment all that stuff is based on a point system of how much attachment and equipment you can equip but I like that about this game, the leveling instead gets you cosmetics.",True

"This game is bizarre, cheap, and fun as hell.  In short, you clear buildings full of bad guys using whatever weapons you can find in a fast-paced, ultra-violent, arcade style.  It looks kind of mindless in videos, but it actually makes you do a lot of quick thinking, resulting in crazy combos that feel intuitive and rewarding.  A common example might be - bust down a door, throw something at the guy with the gun, punch over the guy charging at you with the bat, choke out the gunman before he can get up, then pick up the gun and shoot the guy with the bat before he can get to you again, all in just a couple seconds or less.  This is unscripted action movie stuff you're doing and the flow is great, once you get into it.  The extremely fast pace does give it a little learning curve, but the simple controls and limited back-in-action time minimize the frustration.  The soundtrack is also excellent.",True

Mechanics are crisp, the stages are approachable in many ways, you can full stealth through the stage to get to your target/objective undetected or you can show up at the front door ready to begin a full blown massacre, the choice is yours to make.

The story is pretty interesting, nothing feels rushed, the relationship between Corvo and Emily feels very natural. And God does it feel good to [spoiler] kill those filthy traitors at the end. [/spoiler]  In my opinion the real MVP of the story is Samuel, he's a real G.

"This is NOT a game, but an experiment to digitally adapt a classical book. It is a new form of entertainment.

http://thestorymechanics.com/digital-adaptations/

I bought it out of curiosity when it was on sale. I haven't read the book myself in real life, but I know someone who has and she has practically told me every explicit detail of the book itself. This digital adaption remains true to the original work, while the movies are notorious for taking liberties in every kind of direction.

Each backdrop is a hand painted background. This makes me wonder how long this actual production took to make? Also when you see the list of people's names in the credits at the end, your jaw will drop with the sheer army of people needed in creating it. This therefore makes me question, especially in this day and age, if this style of entertainment and the amount of money which is needed to create and publish it, will honestly be wasted when trying to sell it to the gaming community at large? 

The interaction which is needed to propel the story forward is negligible and while the story has it's moments of suspense here and there, there are still large blocks of moments where nothing much is really happening. The digital adaption will largely play out as an audio book decorated with backdrops, however there are also significant parts which require you, yourself to read or click to skip it entirely. The option to have it all acted out for you is simply not there, which since it most of the time plays out like a movie, I was disappointed that it did not do this all the time.

Most gamers today are conditioned to want constant visual stimuli at high octane speeds, to be entertained every millisecond. This type of production does not do that. Having said that, I still enjoyed it myself as something different. Though they have given birth to a new form of entertainment, this concept while it is still in it's infancy stages it does have a lot of room to grow and mature and it will be interesting to see how this concept flourishes. Might be a worth a look if your into classical literature. Definitely a wait for a sale.

"So in game you can shame an enemy captain to lose levels (you can't recruit them if they're higher leveled than you) or just for poop and giggles. Also apparently they can become deranged or maniacal which would change their stats. So I wanted to try out the last part on one captain and I chose one. 

Now keep in mind he was this huge Olog-Hai captain. Now first time I shamed him no problem, he leveled down as normal. Second time, same story. Now the third time was when he commented on the fact that I like torture rather than killing, but he was still himself. The fourth time onwards was when it spiraled downhill. 

When I met him he no longer has any cocky things to say....he just...cries. His title had disappeared too, just his name alone. His weaknesses started to pile up the more I shamed him as well. At first it was just things like 'Dazed by Execution' and stuff but the more shame he got the more stronger weaknesses he got. Now he can be killed by a headshot to the head and by stealth killing him.

Guys.

He wanted to die.

I've never felt more scum than I did at that very moment in my life. So I put an arrow in his head.

"This is the first FMV game from Wales Interactive that I will be trying to review, I am going through it as they were released.

The Bunker is a much more cinematic take on FMV games than I have seen in many years (mainly because the last major one I can think of was a Tex Murphy game). In it you play as John, portrayed by Adam Brown, who was born and raised in the titular Fallout Bunker and after the death of his mother must survive as the systems designed to keep him alive begin to fail. Gameplay is rather simple with a cursor and highlighted points, a la Telltale adventure games, with the occasional multi-click or drag button to interact with. 

My 1 run through took me a little over 2 hours, which I don't think is necessarily a bad thing, at least if your like me and purchased it on sale. The plays more like a interactive movie than a game and it was nice to play something that didn't require a huge time commitment from me. Overall I would recommend this game, just don't expect to be playing it over and over again.",True

"What can be said about this game today that hasn't been said before? Pretty much: Nothing. This game is simply outstanding. It has it all. It is a PERFECT 10 OUT OF 10. This game has established what a great game should be. Even after more than 4 years from its release, this game is not only still relevant, but it is still the best one out there. You have to have it.

The story is simply amazing, it takes your emotions for a ride and not only the story of the main quests, but also the stories of the side quests or even the little ones. I was just wandering about and I met a little girl all alone, a ""monster"" kill everyone in her settlement... I'm not gonna spoil it, I'm just saying that after that mini quest, I was wondering again, and I met the same girl, She was happy now, She gave me gift... That was just superb and it was a minor quest!

Just as the previous Witcher's games, your decisions matter, but now more than ever, you can get an ending so heartbreaking you'll be sad for a week, or you can get such a happy ending that you will be excited for more!

The looks on this game are just marvelous, the best the industry has to offer! Going from the gritty and sad Velen, to the snowy mountains of Skellige or even the filthy streets of Novigrad or the wonderful bridge to enter Oxenfurt, the sights you'll have to enjoy will just make you not rush this game at all. You'll want to just get on your horse and go for a stroll, enjoying the view.

Regarding the gameplay, this game definitely tones down the high learning curve of the previous one, and this makes it more enjoyable from the very beginning. This allows you to pick what kind of a witcher you want to be... again! From alchemist or magical or fighter, your choice: Want to rely on potions, you can do it, maybe you are more of a magic and signs, fine do it, maybe you want to cut people in half with your sword, no problem, you can build yourself whatever way you want to, and most importantly: it is both fun and easy to do.

I've taken so long to write this review because I knew there would not be a way in which I could make this game any justice. If after all this time, you are still doubting about getting this game, then just get into youtube, watch a side quest not related to ""The Bloody Baron"" (you don't want to spoil that one) and afterwards, get the game and enjoy the experience!

I might return to this review, I just don't feel it's good enough...",True

Love that all the characters have different perks and that you can level them all up and do daily quests and also that there is more than one way for the survivors to win.

You can rambo your way into a company and take down anyone you're capable of depending on your equipment. You can be like me and hold everyone I see at gunpoint...even the snipers. It's a puzzle game that sometimes can have you thinking quick because of the gimmick to rig whatever to whatever happens in real-time; you can also plan ahead and make little tricks that turn what was meant to stop you into an advantage in many situations.

Gunpoint has some story and it requires you to choose a side to work for. The different sides have the same reward, so the only thing you get in picking a certain side is Steam Achievements for that particular side. 

Overall, Gunpoint  is really fun and creative, but short. I beat it (the main story) in about 2.9 hours and those are including times I retried missions for certain outcomes. Good thing there are community maps.",True

"[b]A Bird Story is a beautiful game, telling a surprisingly deep story without saying a word.[/b]

First, if you were somehow confused, there is absolutely no game mechanic here aside from movement and activation. This is a story, and is judged here based on the quality of that story and its presentation.

I am a big fan of this creator's art style, reminsicent of the 16-bit RPGs of my youth. Instead of using them for fantasy settings, collection elemental orbs to defeat some sort of wizard trying to destroy the world, a story is told in more relatable and modern human terms, with subtle artistic choices having great effect. Accompanying the whimsical visuals is fantastic music that captures and inspires the direction of the story.

A selling point and the fascinating point of this story, is not a single word is used in telling the story. This game is a silent display, relying on its art and music to tell the tale. We are familiar with mute characters, who can display incredible emotion, and the restriction across the entire story really does a great service to the concept that communication is perhaps negligibly a result of language.

At 5$ this game is a short, but impactful experience. If you need a shot of feels, and  have a few hours, then this game delivers. This game, along with To The Moon are a testament to what an RPGmaker style game can allow, telling a story without sophisticated assets or any game mechanics, but allowing a different medium for storytelling.

"*Edited 5/2/2016 (pieces cut and clarifying statements added)
I was surprised by it.

I like sneak games in general. 
The difference with this game is you are tactically guiding the main character stealthily to safety.

*You're POV is the cameras in the building. This is not everyones cup of <favorite beverage>.

"Teleglitch is an anomaly. That's a play on words, based on the ever-present black goo that engulfs every corner of this game. But seriously folks, I have put in quite a bit of undocumented hours into Teleglitch: Die More Edition and have yet to beat it. So my perspective is from someone who hasn't beat level 6 yet.

I say it's an anomaly, because so many reviews describe it as repetitive, esoteric, self-indulgent, and impossible, and yet so many describe it as more horrifying and entertaining than any other game they've played. From my point of view-- it's a little of both. But, in the end I side with the latter.

Set in a science facility on an uninhabitable planet, placed on the outer reaches of known space. A black gyrating void has breached the compound and corrupted the facilities AI, using the armed robotic soldiers, necrotic tissue specimens, and multi limbed plankton monsters to purge the planet of any human life. Except they missed one... you. As an engineer, living off of canned food for weeks in a broom closet, you leave your haven to find the master teleporter to send you back to Earth. There is only one problem. You have to navigate 10 randomly generated levels of monster and robot infested hallways and courtyards, teleporter by teleporter, until you reach Earth. When you die-- you die. Fortunately, there are chests, hidden caches, and monster dropped equipment to help you along the way. And being an engineer has its perks, like being able to improve your weapons and make devices to warn you of any impending dangers, or shell any impending dangers, or set exploding meat traps for any impending dangers. Did I mention this game has IMPENDING DANGERS?

Sometimes, I just want to end my life after some impending dangers end my hard work, over and over again. It's gets grating after awhile, like the devs designed it to never be beaten by anything that can competently operate a keyboard and mouse. Yet, many have done it... there is hope.

Bottom line is, buy this game. Play through that ""This game is too fucking hard!!!!!"" phase that all of us go through, and learn how to invest time and thought into making your next move, as if you were really stuck on a planet full of impending dangers.

UPDATED REVIEW..................

Since my review I have reached level 9. I stepped away from the game for a week and returned with the passion of a thousand fires and slowly worked my way up. Defeating the Heavy Destroyer Snake is almost muscle memory now, and the Blue Walker even easier. How did I achieve success and guaranteed advantage to eventually beat the game?

Arena.

The weapon combinations in Arena help prioritize which builds you want for certain enemies with each passing level. Plus, it gives incentive to use explosives like the nailbomb, which is the Deus Ex Machina of ammo conservation, otherwise a very overlooked piece of arsenal.

I could go on, but the most important thing I learned during this last bout is that this game is not for casual gamers. It's a game of passion, that separates those who enjoy building twitch skills through negative reinforcement, and those who would rather... I'm not sure how to end that actually. Who wouldn't want to build up their skills?

In an interview, test3 developed the game with testing and building their gaming skills in mind. Roguelike games, and ""grind like"" games like the Souls series are what keep me interested in gaming, and these kinds of projects draw the line between people who want to game, and those who want to run their thumbs over their phone screens like they're rubbing one out.

MORE UPDATED REVEW...........................

After 107 hours of play, I finally beat it. How, you ask? What got me through until the end with enough life, ammo, and chances to comes back with teleporters was managing who I shot with what guns. Anything humanoid should be taken out with SMG or MSGdrm, large gunners with Heavy Rifle, swarms with AGL1 (no need to upgrade anymore than 1), and for the love of god and all that is holy, don't make a teslacoil, make the LasergunMod and tap to shoot the squideyes. Make PfaustAP's for bosses, and do not use your shotgunX2 unless you find a secret or facing the last boss.",True

"I'm finally getting round to my review for Europa Universalis IV (EU4). Many may be suprised to see that I am not, in-fact, recommending this game. No doubt this review will receive criticism, I can completely understand why. This game is dearly beloved by the Paradox community and is, without a doubt, the most played and most popular game of the franchise. The brutal, unavoidable truth is that, despite the things I am going to say in this review, if you haven't purchased this game and are contemplating it, you will probably enjoy it. The game does a lot right, specifically the way that it juggles war and diplomacy, and I would make the argument that EU4 is the epitome of grand strategy gaming. However, this review is not a pandering of the mass opinion. Rather, I am going to attempt to explain how I see the game in the hope that anyone like myself doesn't waste their money on something they will come to dislike.

EU4 does little wrong as a standalone game. It does what it says on the tin and it does it well. The issue comes with the wider picture. If this is your first venture into grand strategy games of any kind, especially Paradox grand strategy games, then purchase EU4. It is sweet and simple. To more experienced strategy gamers, on the contrary, EU4 sees its first onion right here.

The game is too easy.

Not that its so easy that you could achieve world domination on your first playthrough, mind you. Rather, what I mean by describing it as too easy is that the game is too simple - there isn't enough to do - and all of the difficulties are uncontrollable random events. Other games - its strategy brethen in particular - don't have this issue. Whilst random events do occasionally come in to shake things up, the emphasis is on the strategy, the methods you employ to improve your scenario and the risk factors involved in making these decisions. Other strategy games tend to work like an echo chamber. Crusader Kings 2 (full review on my profile), another Paradox grand strategy game, is a perfect example of this. When a random event occurs that hinders you - or when you employ a risky strategy that fails - you could lose everything. Your kingdom could collapse, you could go into serious debt and you might even be killed, whittling your dynasty down to the imbecilic cousins you've spent years trying to hide. However, and this is where the magic is, the game isn't over. In CK2 you are perfectly capable - and I know because i've done it - of taking this depleted position and slowly and methodically scheming your way to the top, courtesy of intrigue, murder and sex. By placing so much emphasis on the personal motives and intrigue, CK2 does as good a job as The Godfather or House of Cards. CK2 encourages you to fail and rewards you when you do. Success in Crusader Kings 2 makes the game harder - with far more internal threats - whilst failure motivates you to regain everything you've lost. Europa Universalis simply can't do this. It's so black and white. When you fail, if you truly fail, it's game over and when you succeed you are unstoppable. This isn't challenging and it isn't fun. It's simply a poorly made difficulty slider. The fact that EU4 lacks the political intrigue and threats of other strategy games means that its entire focus is on the military. It's a game about blobbing and colouring the map. There's nothing wrong with this, but it makes it easy and simple. the fact that it is entirely reliant on dice roll - quite literally - with two armies clashing and the winner being decided by randomly generated numeric values, means that it isn't a strategy game. It's gambling.

Strategy, by definition, is the art of creatively overcoming certain circumstances. When you have a game that presents either one nation being vastly superior to another, or, when the two are on equal footing the victor being decided by the roll of a dice, there is no strategy involved. It is luck and chance, and this makes Europea Universalis IV simple and easy.

Playing as a major nation, such as France, Austria or England, makes it impossible to genuinely be strategically outmanouvred. You will almost always have the larger army, the stronger economy, the better technology. You are fighting a downhill battle and the only things that can really defeat you are things out of your control - random events or coalitions. It's like a train without brakes - it ploughs through almost everything and the only thing to challenge it is when something else comes along and forces it off the tracks. When did this become strategy?

Truly, this game is akin to a Total War campaign where you only auto-resolve battles.

The natural opposition to what i'm saying is that you should play a more difficult nation - an OPM or technologically inferior state - however, even then it's not strategic. You only have one way to go: up. It's a slow grind, don't get me wrong, and you will often fail. However, the fact that your success as an OPM is based on a combination of good luck and slowly eating the bread crumbs until you expand large enough to steam roll, isn't tactical or strategic. It's just boring.

A strategy game should get harder as you progress - akin to what happens in CK2 - not easier. It is for these reasons that I cannot, in my right mind, recommend Europa Universalis IV.",False

[h1]Short review[/h1]

Indeed, this game is a little too repetitive in its course, provided with a poorly readable map and offering some annoying investigations or an AI sometimes a bit too irascible, Assassin's Creed is not perfect it's true. But for real, this game is like an adorable kid that you can't scold when he does something bad. Some words to define it? Epic, immersive, magnificent and addicting. The first game of the Assassin's Creed franchise possesses far too many qualities for me to have the courage to dislike it. It's an HIT and that's it. You have the chance to play this legendary game, and you never have? Do yourself a favor, buy it.

[h1]Long review[/h1]

For those who were living in a cave during the last 12 years, in this game you play as Altaïr, a member of the Assassins, a small group anxious to put an end to the third campaign of the Crusades. Fallen because of his arrogance, Altaïr will have to undergo a series of tests in order to regain his honor and hir rank of Master Assassin. 9 tests, 9 targets that will be sought from Damascus to Acre via Jerusalem, three colossal cities where will send you your Master, Al Mualim.

Natural and fluid are the first words that come to my mind when talking about Assassin's Creed. Everyone knows that Altaïr moves with such ease that he makes the Prince of Persia look like an arthritic ancestor. Most of you have undoubtedly seen a few videos of the acrobatic prowess of the assassin, climbing and leaping with more ease than a cat. You just have to imagine Prince of Persia on steroids and without any limit to get an idea of what it is about. A true trademark of the franchise, these sessions are a pure treat, not only for the player but also for his aesthetic eyes as the animation of Altaïr burst the screen. Now if you played the recent Assassin's Creed, you would know it is easier to climb and do parkour than in this game, but hey, it was the first one and it is already extremely good.

Now, for each target you have to kill, the ritual will be quite similar. Don't get noticed. While moving freely in the city, certain rules must be observed. While running, you attract attention, by bumping into citizens as well and I will not talk about climbing on the roofs guarded by archers. In short, keep a low profile or be quick to fix your mistakes to calm the AI. These represent the bases of discretion and concealment and you will constantly need them to play with the reaction of the AI that is attentive to your every move.

""And the assassinations, how does it work??"" Yes, I'll talk about that you bunch of impatient gamers. Upon arriving to the city where the target is located, the procedure will hardly vary. The 3 cities are divided into 3 districts with a significant number of towers or other summits forming observation points on which you will have to climb in order to update your map and start to spot the preliminary surveys. Theft of a card pickpocket style, an informant exchanging tips against the death of a few soldiers or even a muscular interrogation. With this you accumulate data on your target, when to hit, where the guards are stationed, how to approach, etc. The more missions of this type you complete, the more you will know and the easier the assassination will be. Patience, an old recipe that applies perfectly to this Assassin's Creed. Much like a game like Hitman, rushing won't get you any good here.

Once ready, you can start the actual assassination sequence. Well, provided you have thought of covering your back. Before acting, it is a good idea to clean a way out that will hamper your escape. Also, make allies by helping the harassed citizens in the streets of the city. You will understand the importance of this and using the informations at your disposal. Strike your target at the moment and place where she is weak to attend the confession. Because, yes, to each stolen life corresponds a scene of confession on the threshold of death, a moment out of time during which Altaïr and his prey chat and remake the world together, the good and the bad, the good guys, the bad guys, the weather (just kidding) notions which will be quickly relativized by Altaïr, disturbed in his beliefs. The assassinations benefits from a strong staging with dramatic intonations that prevent it from sinking into the trivial.

After eliminating your target, you will have to escape. Better to have prepared the ground well to get away quickly when the alert is sounded throughout the city. But it is still challenging to avert confrontation even by doing so.

And that's excellent because I wanted to describe the combat system. In addition to the secret blade that can be used to overcome an inattentive target, Altaïr has a sword and a short blade. Timing is everything with this combat system. It is therefore partly based on observation. If an opponent pretends to strike you, throw a counter (usually not only monstrously classy but incidentally deadly). Or break his guard to strike at him. Simple but complete enough for this title that does not emphasize fighting. As far as possible, it is better to avoid them, even if they will sometimes be compulsory.

That said, I will not try to hide that avoiding trouble is not always easy. Yes, you can make your life easier by being patient and preparing well, but for the rest, the slightest mistake can put you in embarrassment. In a city full to the brim, one quickly makes a mistake. In the crowded streets of Jerusalem, Acre or Damascus, you will find citizens, soldiers, thieves and also beggars coming to cling to your sleeves, preventing you from moving forward. This quickly becomes tense during a spinning. And no, you can't throw them away if you do not want the guards to come at you to see what is happening. Same for the women carrying jars who will cause a scandal if they are knocked down. Walk smoothly or go through the roofs. Don't freak out if you do not want to disturb the AI. That being said, killing a Templar represent a great way to create a diversion and clear a path. The AI is a fluctuating data in Assassin's Creed, which is also one of its flaws.

For reasons of progression, the AI reaction has the unpleasant habit of varying and what seems to usually bother no one suddenly becomes a crime. You will understand that this is frankly annoying. Moreover, in the list of flaws, it is difficult to ignore the very repetitive nature of this game. If each assassination sequence is original and unique, the process which precedes it constantly heats up the same mechanisms: spotting investigations from the observation points then carry them out. And there are very few types of investigations.

But hey, Assassin's Creed is one of those titles for which you can forgive almost everything. Because it has a crazy class and it is addictive. Not to forget that this is the first game of this epic franchise. I personally finished it 100%, all the flags and templars found and all missions done. It took me a long time, but I finally did it and I regret nothing.

"Ah fell seal. The game about a soccer mom who, after complaining to a manager about their employee, becomes so disappointed with the way that the worlds manager is handling things, that she inadvertently ends up on a quest to herself become the manager this world so desperately needs. 

The gameplay isn't half bad and the sprites and world look decent as well... the main characters pictures all, don't get me wrong they aren't ugly, they all just look like side characters.

"First of all, for the start of the review... Whoever design the keymapping needs to be beheaded... he doesn't use his head much anyway so he doesn't deserve it at all!! He thinks the players need more than 1 button to do ""confirmation"". ""Okay"" and ""OK"" isn't the same thing to him and he require us to use a different set of direction control for different parts of the menu, and to press different buttons for different confirmation. And the game don't show the changes on the UI after you change the key mapping too, you have to guess what the tutorial is telling you and which button to push and of course, the UI still suggesting the old default buttons making a good confusion for those playing on keyboard. For a game of this price, this shouldn't be happening at all. Big failure! Not even Indie and Doujin maker does this kind of mistake nowadays. Especially we can't say this game lack maintenance when they keep adding DLCs to it, yet old mistakes and flaws are never fixed. 

Second, the game is a rush and hasty remake of the old MK2 with some extra contents (that doesn't come with voice acting), a fast cash grab on the remake trend, yet the game company tries to milk it further for more cash from time to time by adding tons of [b]JUNK[/b] DLCs. They even go as far as to sell you basic menu options as DLC in Rebirth1 just so you can replay and view old cut-scene videos. This company is getting pretty low on moral when it comes to money grabbing and there's a bottomless immorality to it. These guys really has no shame of themselves. I don't mind new characters or outfits DLCs that actually show some love and workmanship that deserves the money, but these are not the kind of DLC that we should pay for. Especially the QoL contents like having characters tag along behind, or viewing previous cut-scenes [b]SHOULD NOT[/b] be sold as DLC but rather an update to the main game with options setting to turn them on/off (yeah, not everyone wants it). The dev owe us that much with the lack of design planning in the first place.

Third, they started selling ""Complete Set"" of the game including all DLCs when the game's gotten old, very convenient and how thoughtful of them, we can get everything in one easy click! Then they decide to push out a few more new DLCs after that, so those who bought and played the game didn't really know since they finished the game and moved on, but those who bought the complete game and put it in their pending to play list will soon realize that the game they bought is no longer the ""complete version"" anymore, they will either be forced to buy the new DLCs or play without them. Not only that, they are still selling the ""Complete set"" that's [b]Incomplete[/b] to the new buyers right now. This is turning into a Beautiful conmanship don't you think? ""Come buy the complete set that doesn't comes with everything!"". They are unwilling to add the new DLCs to the complete set and raise the price, just because they want the old customers who bought the complete set to spend more money. They are willing to risk their reputation with the new customers just because they wanted a few more bucks from the old ones... Good job! We all can pretty well see how they treat their customers from this ""decision"".

Forth, other than the new characters in the DLC, all the dungeons are just a reskin of the existing one from the main game (which is also a similar copy of Rebirth 1). We can't even call that hard work because a simple change in hue tone isn't something i condiser ""hard work"" and reselling that as ""something new"" is well... we can see how the people in charge in their office truly is by now... practical and eco-lover, they love recyling and nothing is wasted. It's... a good thing? Well.. probably a good practise if it doesn't burn holes in wallets.. :3 But is it worth buying the DLC? No, they only add to your grind time and mess up the chirper events in game, you will need to spend a long time pressing buttons to get through those meaningless event that has no rewards nor a meaning to exist. Yes, FILLERS to get the game play longer. Just like the story, 30 minutes main story, 100 hours fillers of none important stuffs. And the DLC add to that fillers part making your life in game worse. I can actually fall alsleep on this game, it's that boring because of their grind design + trying to prolong a game play to over 100 hours with no real story. Plus, a lot of the events will let you wonder why they are there, they are all messed up and not in the correct time line. And since they are all fillers anyway, no one really cares, including the devs.

Fifth, the game launches with a crash to desktop bug, the game company seems to be super used to handle angry customers, and they address to that by posting on the community before things get out of control. Yes, they announced they know the bug, and that's it, no more reply apart from that, that's their customer service against a bunch of angry customers. ""We will fix it soon"". Which works well since that post, like a magnet, is sucking all the angry customers in and everyone is required to post their long list of specs which give them less chance to type something negative. I am super impressed on how they managed their customers anger, truly cold blooded but practical professionist! Okay... they did fix the game after that, but the bug comes back every once a while when they add new DLCs, and that's not just once. And they are able to pull that trick on their customers again to cool them off, impressive! But, if it happened more than once already, it can always happen again right?

Sixth, it still hit my nerves seeing misunderstanding on the reviews saying that this is a direct sequel to the story from Rebirth1, that's because those playing the localized version are banging their heads on their monitor trying to understand what's being said. Very bad translation job making this already hard to understand dimension thing even more messy.  So you either need to learn Japanese or, like some players did, get a mod to get yourself a better fan made translation. Yeah, ""Leave it to the fans to fix things so we can have more time to make junk DLCs!"". Great job!

Lastly, the game is okay, well, less okay than Rebirth1 in compare, but still okay in a way, even when the contents makes me fall asleep during play... A great part of the game isn't voiced. This game is a remake of the old MK2, so any new scenes and characters dialog doesn't get voiced, including the new DLCs, No, Rebirth1 isn't 100% fully voiced too due to the same reason. The Story isn't the happy go lucky type of Rebirth1 but a Timid and hold-off type since it's Nepgear and the sisters being the protagonists, so it might not suits everybody's taste, especially those who come here for a good laugh will surely find themselves laughing less compared to Rebirth1.(But that's character setting, so we can't say the story is bad when we don't like a character right?) Well, the story is NOT AT ALL related to Rebirth1, it's just using some of its characters in this new [i]alternative[/i] story time line (another dimension), even though it looks like it's a continue from the bad end of Rebirth 1, it wasn't (I blame these confusions on bad translation).But like Rebirth1, there's no deep plots, no surprises, just a simple hollow story to give this game a reason to exist, an excuse to make this game, typical game come first, story second, type of design concept/plan. One can describe the full game story in a few short sentences, and it's not a memory problem, it's because the game really does only have that short of a story setting, 30 minutes of the real story, 100 hours of fillers. It's like a talk show/radio, you won't remember a thing because they are not worth remembering. There's only 2 main goals in the game, save the goddess, defeat the boss. That's it. The rest are long talks of fillers.

Well, in short, this game is a patient tester. For Grinders.",False

"Why the heck would you write a review from a trusted company's early access game, complaining that it doesn't have enough content 'YET'?

That's like saying this water is bland before it has been turned to soup yet... that's why you don't write a review 'YET'

I purchased the game during alpha testing. All I had to eat was lice, and mud pies(dirt and water). Did I like that? Not really, not enough variety of foods. I did not write a review complaining about being able to live off lice. Now they added more foods, and now I can't live off lice unless I water it, keep it in ideal temperature, gas pressure, with correct irrigation system; or it won't give me any seeds to plant more. Now I write a review. 

I love this game for the innovative liquid and gas piping, filtration and massive recycling for a mini colony because you ain't got sh*t if you don't(literally?). It kind of teaches some concepts in the real world like converting a natural gas to energy for user consumption... So what that you don't know what to do when you reach a certain point; how far can you actually last?

"If you like Paradox strategy games + a focus on combat this game is for you. 

Pros:
-WWII theme
-play any country on the map
-Lots of customization options 
-Lots of micromanaging 
-tons of air, land, and sea battles to fight
-a ""historical"" mode as well as a ""randomize"" mode for gameplay variety 

Cons:
-Lots of micromanaging 
-AI is fairly linear 
-only a select group of countries have a unique ""State Focus"" tree (sort of a framework for your country's political and military development)
-very time intensive

"This game was hugely disappointing. Why is it so difficult for developers to replicate Road Rash? Every reboot, remake, reimagining, homage, always focuses on the fighting. Fighting in Road Rash was a novelty but not what made the game special. It was the racing. The twisting turns, the trecherous roadways; it was the rush when you threaded the needle at top speed on the 15th mile of Pacific highway. The key to success was racing clean or a kick to your opponent at an opportune time, because getting into a slugfest slowed you down and cost you the race. It was as much you against the level as it was you against your opponents. There was a vibe, an edge, and one hell of a soundtrack.

Road Redemption has none of these things. It is bland and devoid of character. It focuses too much on weapons and damaging your opponents and not enough on racing or level design. The core gameplay mechanic, how you navigate through the game, is also flawed. Rather than a hub where you can select races or make a name for yourself on some underground circuit, you are forced to progress through a series of ""levels"". Each level has an objective, win the race, take out x number of oppontents, use this special move, etc. The kicker: when you die, you start back at the beginning. Not a unique concept, starting at the beginning when you die, but an odd one for a racing game. And for a game with such drab gameplay, repeating the opening levels numerous times is more punishment than consequence.

All in all, if you're looking for a Road Rash equivalent, keep looking. This game offers no redemption.",False

"A worthy successor to the originals, as each installment in the series has been. No other interactive electronic experience will ever come close to how mind-blastingly bodacious this is...Well, maybe the sequel will, but that's besides the point.

Overall, if you play video games for fun, here's the thing for you! I, for one, can't think of the last time I enjoyed a single-player FPS so thoroughly. The game honors it's predecessors with the feel of the originals, and the look of it's later installments. 

Sure, it's not as revolutionary as the first game was, but who cares? A fun game is a fun game, and that's that. Just slay demons, don't think about it too much! Although if you DO want to think, there's a huge amount of lore documents to dive into. The campaign is riddled with secrets and hidden things to find; and, surprisingly, the lore behind it all is actually worth getting into!...Who'da thunk it?  

The game does have it's flaws, and a few of them. Multiplayer is fun, but hilariously undercooked for what it is. The level editor is intuitive, but frankly, it lacks the fidelity to make exactly what you want. Also, only custom levels have co-op functionality, so that's a shame. Thankfully, the campaign makes up for most of that, and I recommend the game solely for the single-player.

tl;dr: If you want the game, get the game. It's fun, relatively low-priced, and the new one is coming out soon! There's no better time to get into DOOM than right now. This is probably the most hype the series has had since the 90's, and that's saying something. Don't go in with giant expectations, and you'll be pleasantly surprised!

"Man, this game is seriously fun.  Each level is short, only a couple/few minutes each, but there are tons of levels and dozens of level types to keep things interesting.  This game is exactly what I always imagined it would be like if Xiao Xiao was a game but with awesome backgrounds and effects. I don't even want to give examples so you can discover them for yourself, but here's some pros and cons:

Pros
 - Simple mechanics yet amazingly varied gameplay for literally using nothing but 2 mouse buttons (doesn't even matter where the mouse is).  
 - Cool stick figure dude animations, the style is amazing
 - Said dude pulls off what feels like hundreds of different badass kung fu moves 
 - Several different weapons, both melee and thrown
 - Crazy cool random super-moves that slow down the fight so you can enjoy the carnage
 - Use the backgrounds to beat down your opponents
 - Character upgrades by way of skills/moves awarded for beating certain levels
 - Good pacing and difficulty curve
 - Funny and/or interesting little messages from the devs after each level
 - Flawlessly executed, everything is balanced and mixed just right to make things ridiculously fun.  

Cons 
 - It is a little weird not having an exit button, meh... close it like you close any Windows program.
 - Voiceover is trying so hard to be 70's kung fu style that it comes off as slightly racist to me
 - Literally nothing else.

"The game is great, and I'm not going to add all the positive points of the game because everyone can find that in google or steam.


The main problem of the game are in the online comunity. And this is the reason for my negative review.
The number of cheaters is very very high.
They destroy the game of the other players with their mods and cheats. Here are some examples:
- 1/10 sessions, at some point, someone starts to give huge quantities of money. The only solution is swap session and lose your progress.
- 1/4 sessions, people are asking in the chat for god mode, prop shopers and planes to start killing everyone.
- 1/3 sessions, people in chat are asking: ""anyone can give me some money?"".
- 1/8 sessions, you are in a mission and a cheater replace all the players in an isolated place and start killing everyone. You are forced to swap session and you lose the mission.
- 1/8 sessions someone in god mode starts killing everyone.
- You can report the cheaters, mark them to kick. But this is useless because they are soo many of them.. even if rockstars made some actions, they just apear again.

That leaves the rest of us in a game that either doesn't get new players, or players who join as spectators, because game mechanics.

"If you love dragons, and have dragons in your heart, you owe it to yourself to play Angels with Scaly Wings. But that might not be enough. Especially since, apparently, this game has a reputation for being ""the game where you can bone or be boned by a dragon""... which is actually true for the most part. I'm a furry, so it doesn't really bother me in the slightest. But for a ""normie"", as it were, that might be a problem. However, I can promise you that nothing ""bad"" happens, there's just a lot of flirting going on here and there, and maybe an extreme close-up shot of a dragon with quite the bedroom eyes face ( and a dragon laying naughtily on your couch, showing off his... er... with some clever censorship ). It's pretty mild all things considered, and it doesn't matter if it floats your boat or not.

The dragons are all great and have varied personalities. Some are so cute it hurts ( I'm partial to Anna and Adine )! There's many more dragons to meet throughout the course of this game. I already love dragons so this game was sort of a no-brainer. But I have no idea why I let this game pass me by, because it's pretty much on par with Undertale, One Shot, and other such games in terms of emotional investment. Let me explain.

This game might appear to be a joke, but there's an intense and intricate story here. Like Undertale, multiple playthroughs are a must, and your actions can permanently affect some aspects of the game ( such as items you need, which you won't need to recollect ). Characters will change, and things will play out differently if you have the right item or make the right choices. You will laugh, you will cry, blah blah blah, you get the gist of it. The only problem is the barrier to entry; the strange subject matter of dating dragons. But the funny part is you don't really even have to ""date"" anyone in this game. You can just be friends with them all, and leave it at that. So you can tailor your experience based on your choices. I almost cried a few times, and gasped out loud. I'm surprised how emotionally invested I was, and I'm going back for more as soon as I can. By the way, this review was written after my FIRST playthrough. There's a lot more to go! Mod support ensures that there's new content, may it be improvements to the game or entirely new characters!

There's one more major problem. The serious tone of the game clashes with the dragons being inexplicably attracted to you and romantically attracted to you. But that didn't bother me, personally. I honestly think it was sweet... meaning that love and romance can transcend species barriers between sentient beings. Just be aware of this before jumping in to this very draconic adventure!

I recommend Angels with Scaly Wings. It's a surprisingly polished, deep, fun, and emotional experience!",True

I [b] LOVE [/b] this game!

Sadly yes, it has a kind of low community population, but if you can, share it! let's try to revive this! i'd love to see it bounce back and get a healthy community again.

I had a bunch of other of my friends play along with me since I bought the 4 pack and gave them out.

It was so much fun cooperating and captaining my very own airship, flying around the beautiful smog filled world and hearing the cannons and rail guns roar as I try to dodge and maneuver around the environment, ramming into a vessel with your own is pretty satisfying too.
-As an engineer, the impending doom that is trying to repair the ship gives a really good sense of rush and turmoil.
-And as a Gunner, the feeling of penetrating your enemy ship can only be more satifying with bigger guns and harder hits, watching them go down is still the best part though.

TL;DR: There is no actual end game except trolling others, and end game mobs are scalled so that if you perfectly maximize and balance your gear with end-game items, you have a chance of beating the end-game missions.

-Enjoyable combat(It feels to me like how Neverwinter's combat was, but this is a little bit faster pace) 
-Party Questing in this game actually feels like you're working towards the quest unlike other games(looking at you WoW) 
-The Open World is huge and you can go to any part of it! (Some parts you can get attacked in) 
-Open World PvP ^ (The zones you can get attacked in!!) 
-HUGE skill/stat trees(This game uses the old school Str,Agi,Wis... stats even has an accuracy stat!)
-You can literally tame and ride almost anything!(You can tame a Dragon/Demon with a mace...LOL)
-Insane Character Customization!(It took me an hour just to go through all the options and changes)
-NOT PTW!( I can't stress, this game is a buy and then (optional)subscription) The game has no PTW elements and anything you can buy with IRL money you can make in game and/or currency exchange and buy. 
-Very enjoyable scenery(The game on max settings is amazing and even on lowest settings still will for sure amaze you) You will have some FPS problems, but I normalize about 73 fps on max settings and all I have is a 1060 3GB

It wouldn't be a true review if I didn't give you the cons...

Cons-
-Game was released a little bit too early I think and we were promised a lot, but it's only been 2 days. So I think people are just not very patient.
-End Game content. There is not a ton of end game dungeons or raids to do, but the crafting sytem/gathering system can provide a pretty good way to keep you busy while we wait for updates.
-Suffers huge optimization issues for how long it's been in development 
-More engaging questing experience(The main story is the best part of the leveling to max(still is not an amazing story, but it's a story I guess...))
-They need to fire their translator. The in-game ""english"" is extremely broken and sometimes impossible to understand. There are mispelled words and huge typos.
____________________________________________________________________________________

All in all I think the Pro's outweight the Con's. I think this game is a wonderful game and I plan to put in plenty of hours and continue my subscription. I really hope that Neowiz can see this review because I really hope they keep this game open! I think if people just give them a chance to continue working their game and stop trying to bash them on every forum, it would allow a wider variety of gamers to give the game a chance. People are killing the game in only 2 days of ""early access"" release. I personally love the game and don't plan on playing much of anything else for a while. I just hope you give the game a fighting chance and look past the ""8 hour"" reviews and push through those first 5-10 hours of learning the combat and how the game works. 

Thank you, Bless Online and Thank you NeoWiz!

TL:DR- The game has an Open World with PvP/PvE elements, a vast skill tree and an array of abilties to fight with. Multiple classes along with multiple races make the variety rival that of major titles. I recommend this game!

"You into trading card games like Magic The Gathering or deckbuilder like Ascension? This game takes those game concepts and adds a ""rogue-like"" layer and theme on top of it (Choose your path of progression and random events/encounters).

You choose from 3 different characters (4 if you opt into the PC Beta or mods) that each have their own unique pool of cards and playstyles/strategies. You progress up the tower and doing an encounter each level (Event, Battle, Shop, etc). You start off with a 10 card deck and after every battle (Also sometimes from events) you get to select a card from 3 random ones in the characters pool, similar to a draft in MTG. 

There are ways to remove and upgrade cards like from the shop or events. However like in a MTG draft or a deckbuilder you need to be able to plan out a deck strategy on the fly. Possibly adjusting or modifying it if you get a relic or good card to consider.

Great to play with friends in a ""co-op"" way too if your into that (Trade off between battles or stream it with friend and conquer the spire together).

"Ignore the DRM fuled rage reviews. This game is worth your time and money.

This is easily the best game in the franchise (at least, avialable in the West) and the first in the West to recieve a PC version. Many tasks and such that are typically cumbersome in the series have been vastly streamlined. The game is beautiful, espeically the environments and the monster animation. The music is very good and there's more of it than in past entries in the series. Many other improvements for the franchise await as well, such as being able to string quests together without having to go back and forth between the hub and the hunting grounds- You can change weapons and gear and eat food in the field at camps and this is a huge boon. This is still a very challenging game as is typical of the series, but the improvements in World ensure that it's challenging for all the right reasons.

The PC port is not perfect, however it is still well done and properly utilizes Steam features and doesn't feel half-a$sed. The game does need some more optimizations but it does have plenty of PC specific graphics options and adjusting them can vastly improve performance. I'm sure that improvements will be made where needed, the game has been out for 2 days and some leeway really needs to be given for them to make updates. I will of course update this review if I find that this sort of thing doesn't happen in a reasonable amount of time, but my performance ingame is reasonably good and I'm not really complaining at all.

(Update) While there are still some minor outstanding issues and desired features in the community (such as ultrawide resolutions), a vast number of ingame bugs and networking and matching issues have been addressed. They have also made good on other things- The Harvest Festival was released despite word going around that PC might not get it until the following year. Capcom has shown a willingness to address issues- they have also extended durations for a major event quest after it was bugged at its initial release.",True

"1.0 added a story mode and a lot more boss fights!  
A great game marred mainly from the FPS drops and bad controls.

Pros
+Nigh Infinite World to Explore with Stunning Pixelated Visuals
+Great Soundtrack
+Story Mode to help give some players who are new to sandbox some objectives
+Boss Fights are fairly Interesting and Unique if you don't count the Bad Controls along with Heal Item Spamming that goes along with it.
+a HUGE assortment of items for players who like to colonize and build pretty things.
+Fossil Minigame is fairly enjoyable and a great new addition.
+Modding Support

Cons
-Framerates drop from time to time depending on the number of objects on screen.  The Lag has nothing to do with your system but mainly the engine Starbound's built upon.
-Switching between Tools gets a bit cumbersome and I'm kind of upset that they took away the dash + jump combo which makes me fly like Megaman X.  Now it just looks and feels clunky.
-The Medikit/Nanowrap Spam makes combat unchallenging and unrewarding.  Feels kind of flawed.
-No In-game Pause Button makes the Hunger System for Survival Mode annoying.
-I kind of hate how most of the weapons are randomly generated creating an Inventory mess of stuff to constantly sort through.
-Water Planets is very underwhelming.
-Villagers and the reward they give for completing Quests are pretty bad.  This is because looting items is vastly more rewarding and less time consuming.
-Becoming an administrator of the game does indeed /ruinthefun and needs to be disabled for all modes and enabled on a different new Mode for Players who Mod or Sandbox Build.

Sure, I listed more negatives than positives but you'll definitely be getting your money's worth from the hours you'll likely spend playing it.

"TL;DR 4.5/10 Give this game a wide berth if you like prehistoric animals
There's an edit for the people who want to read about the DLC. it's at the bottom

ARK: Survival Evolved is a game in which you survive on a map filled to the brim with fictional variations of real life prehistoric animals, which you can tame, ride and kill. the crafting progression through the game has to do with your level, and every 5 levels you unlock some new crafting engrams to learn. you start out primitive but end up hypermodern in the late game. Taming takes real time.

The things i mentioned are all features of this game, and now i'm going to tell you why I personally believe it's a bad game, and why I told you to give it a wide berth if you actually love prehistoric animals.

The game has terrible (to almost no) optimization. I myself play this game on a high-end PC and can't play on normal graphics quality without experiencing extreme amounts of lag spikes and general FPS lag. you may write this off due to it being early access. this should not always be the case in early access though. other EA (early access for short in this case) games like starbound (albeit 2D) did not have this amount of preformance issues. it had some lag in crowded areas, but thta's because they were crowded areas, there was lag because of the high amount of NPC's rendered into the world.

ARK has a repetitive gameplay loop. it's always the same, level up, get engrams, craft stuff, tame some animals rinse and repeat. this doesn't only happen when you start a new character, no, it happens basically all the time, it being early access is no excuse here, it's been in EA for a year now and it's boring gameplay loop has barely been changed up, even SotF is the same, run away from danger, get stuff, craft stuff, tame, fight and either die or win. taming is also a repeating process: knock out animal, give taming food, sometimes give narcotic items, wait, done. no matter what you do it stays the same, which is what makes it boring

The animals in game look terrible. now you could tell me ""you're not a 3D modeller and texturer, you wouldn't know how difficult it is"" while this statement is somewhat true, i do understand that you need to make your animals look good if that is one of the few if any reasons it attracts  people to your game. the promise of a dinosaur survival game (although it has many non-dinosaur animals in it) intrigues people, which will make them buy your game, however if your animals look shit, the players won't be satisfied. the focus of the devs has so far been quantity over quality, adding over 50 animals to the game without properly checking their quality.

The reason i said what i said in the TL;DR about avoiding the game if you like prehistoric animals is because this game butchers prehistoric life to be exactly like it wasn't. I.E: The Titanosaurus, it's species name is actually ""vagacastrum"", that means moving castle. I personally like to call it the ""Gregor Clegane dinosaur"" it is quite literally a mountain on legs, it's sheer size alone is ridiculous and far from anything realistic, dwarfing even Toast the Titanosaur (yes, that is a thing. it's the one from the Sir David Attenborough documentary ""Attenborough and the giant dinosaur"") the giganotosaurus is about 4 times the size of the real animal and the Tyrannosaurus is 3 meters too long.  you could put this under ""they're fictional relatives of the real-life animals"" but that still makes some of the features excaggarated. they give animals abilities they normally, even if they were real, couldn't do, like the Doedicurus, in real life it was unable to roll up into a ball, and the physiology of the animal in-game is barely different, still being unable to roll up.
they mislabel animals from their game, like the Tyrannosaurus (known as T. dominus for short) is named Rex in game, it should be named Dominus. or the Megalodon, which should be named C. ultramegalodon or just Ultramegalodon if they want to abandon the scientific part of their game even more.

Last of all, they turned an entire generation of people into Awesomebros (no, being one of those is not a good thing). Awesomebros are people who ignore scientific findings for their own reality. Like T. rex having feathers (yes it did, get over it) they ignore the evidence for that because they don't like it. the way this game did this is it made fictional versions of animals without specifying that outside of dossiers, it calls almost all animals dinosaurs (or dinos) and by making these fictional animals and not giving them scientifically accurate traits, they basically gave people the illusion that these animals really looked like this.
The reason I hate that is for the same reason I hate the shark week C. megalodon mockumentaries. they misinform people and make them even more stupid than they thought they were. 

Overal the idea of this game is good, but it's poorly done and should get looked at by better developers

My judgement is in the TL;DR, but i'll repeat it here:
4.5/10 Give this game a wide berth if you like prehistoric animals

PS: I bought this game with my own money, and was too late to refund it.

"I waited until the game was good enough to recommend, and in my opinion it has reached this stage. When it first came out, I dozed off a couple of times while playing. Now I find the experience engaging and enjoyable.
It is a beautiful game, with a very good soundtrack, and some nice story bits that help immerse you in the universe.
Even though there is no control over combat after it begins, I enjoy watching the fireworks show time and again.
It is somewhat pale in the diplomacy department, but at least the major flaws seem to have been fixed recently.
Planet management is fun, but can get repetitive, since you build almost-everything - or just everything - in every system.
There are meaningful choices to be made in the tech tree, and advancing your technology in key fields can make a big difference - which makes unlocking tech very satisfying.
In summary, while each part of Endless Space 2 might not seem like much on its own, they all combine together to provide a pleasant experience.",True

"I never thought I'd see the day that an official Touhou game would show up on Steam, but hey, it's been one hell of a bizarre year, so here we are.

Touhou Tenkuushou ~ Hidden Star in Four Seasons is the sixteenth official Touhou Project game, a doujin bullet hell series spanning twenty years and put together by one beer-loving man, ZUN (Jun'ya Ota).

The game mechanics are simple enough:  Pick your favorite charcter, shoot down your enemies, dodge their bullets, pick up power-ups, and resolve the incident.  This time around, you select a season to go with your character of choice, giving you an extra ""mini-bomb"" you can build up and use based on the season selected.

Though not as difficult as the previous game, Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom, it is definitely not an easy game.  Memorizing bullet patterns and routes is key to survival.

While the art leaves something to be desired, it's pretty much par for the course as far as Touhou is concerned.  The music, however, has always been one of the strongest points of Touhou–what ZUN lacks in art skills, he more than makes up for with musical talent.  The music is catchy, and you'd do well not to get lost in it.

Overall, HSiFS is great.  It's the second Touhou game to get an official release outside of Japan (after Double Dealing Character), and the first to be released on Steam.  Should it do well, future games will be coming down the pipeline.  Here's to more Touhou games on Steam.",True

"Oxenfree is a graphic adventure played from a 2.5D perspective. The game is mostly played through the focus of Alex, the main protagonist, a teenager who is visiting an abandoned island for an overnight party. 

Instead of dialogue occurring during cutscenes, speech bubbles appear over Alex's, the protagonist, head, allowing the player able to choose what she says next in the conversation while also interacting with the game's world. Puzzles in the game are solved by finding the correct frequency on Alex's handheld radio, which can do everything from unlock doors to communicate with ghosts.

I wasn't expecting this game to be this good. I loved the characters and the relationships they have with each other and how they evolve as the game progresses and you make choices. The fact that the plot involves time and weird pseudo radio science stuff just makes it even better.

"After watching many streams about this game I decided to give it a go. I thought $60 was too much for this game and I still think it's too much. 

The Matchmaking is horrible. Today alone I've spent almost 2hrs trying to get into a group for a mission and I get disconnected as I select the option that throws me into the group. This is usually followed with the inability to reconnect to the game. Often times will have to reattempt to connect 3-4 times before actually getting back into the game where I then try to matchmake again and get disconnected once again. I saw this a lot during the streams as well.

The Game reminds me a lot of Alpha Protocol but multiplayer and a lot more popular (because it's multiplayer?).

The game throws you explanations too far into the game. For example, for my playthrough, they explained matchmaking AFTER I had already completed a group mission. I didn't even know I can ""help"" civilians until I read a random ""tip"" during load. I had wondered what the hell do I do with these ""sodas"" and ""candy bars"" that I've been picking up.

The game is by no means worth it's $60, the connection issues -a lot- of people, including myself, show the game is just not 'ready'. There isn't really a whole lot of content, you'll find yourself repeating stuff A LOT. Not a huge fan of this ""Uplay"" that MUST be installed either.

Awesomenauts in a nutshell: Imagine your DOTA 2/ LoL game in a two-dimensional platformer. The ""Arena"" in your ""Multiplayer Online Battle Arena"" is the key word of Awesomenauts. Fight for dominance while battling droids, players and turrets, and then to their base. Once that's gone, you win.

The multiple characters each offer their own sense of play, and it's very likely to find one that you'll play for hours. The DLC isn't necessary, but if you have some 9 bucks laying around to buy the Starstorm expansion, you should get it. The new characters now only come out if you have Starstorm, I believe. The skins, I couldn't care less, but there are some I might want to get in the future.

"In a world where people continually invest $60 to purchase the latest reskinned edition of Call of Duty where you still are incapable of opening a door comes Dark and Light. 

A fun, yet at some times frustrating (due to the typical EA qwerks) game with an abundance of survival elements and interesting PVP encounters to be had. 

It really irks me that people are as devoted to this titles downfall as they are. Honestly the game can be rough, it has long load screens and the occasional FPS drop but overall the game is filled with potential and even in its current state can be filled with fun open.  Do yourself a favor and give it a try. 

Disclaimer: in my experience the game picks up a lot after about two hours invested. This is somewhat problematic as most members of the steam community only spend 10-30 minutes on the game before usually taking to the review section. I don't necessarily blame them as the refund policy is no longer available after that timeframe but as a result you will see a lot of one-sided opinions.",True

"I personally really enjoyed the story.
The story is based on Final Fantasy XIII and kinda complex, so if you'r more of a casual player you'll probably not like this because you need to keep track of everything and what happened before or you easyly get confused and end up running in circles like a headless chicken.
 
About the gameplay... I liked the previous game better even doe it's almost the same.
Now the world is more open and you can walk freely around but there is really nothing else to do except following the storyline...
It's still the old roundbased tactical combat system but this time you have less party members, which means not so many combinations. That made the combat kinda incidental for me but there are still some good challenges.

"Evidently the Hitman series started off rough. Technically, the game is fine. You can remap the controls to modern standards (for the most part, running will always be goofey) and the graphics aren't distracting. The gameplay, on the other hand... Missions are decently long and realistically there are two ways to beat each mission: the way they want or running and gunning. Trying to do it 'properly' requires you failing about 20x per mission to memorize the map and behaviors of the NPCs and to get timing right and a little luck. I, personally, am not a fan of 'die 100x to succeed' kinds of 'challenge,' I would rather it be possible to use logic and skill to possibly beat it the first try. You can also run and gun and actually there is no penalty for it. No rewards for stealth or silence or whatever.

"I cannot recommend this game enough. OS 2 is a perfect evolution of the strategy/tactical RPGs that previously defined the genre and sets the bar for every strat/tac RPG to follow.

I've played the game for about 17 hours over the last two weeks (technically just one week, as I had to perform a minor repair). The game combines the randomly generated loot/check every vase/pick and choose what you want to keep exploration of Diablo 2 (and is much more forgiving in terms of how much you can carry at once) and the massive open world exploration of Guild Wars, which you are free to explore in real time until you encounter an enemy group. When you do encounter an enemy group, the game switches to turn based strategy (similar to the combat pause in Star Wars: KotOR). Once combat is initiated, the game switches to turn based, like Final Fantasy Tactics, Ogre battle, etc.

This game truly shines, however, in three areas: The sheer fluidity of tactical situations, the character customization, and the way you progress through the story. 

[b]Battle Tactics:[/b] In most strategy games, your team simply attacks the enemies until their HP is reduced to 0. The terrain is merely there to control how your characters can move or maneuver around the enemy team. Occasional the landscape lends you tactical advantages such as increased damage or range. While this remains true in Original Sin 2, there are many more options available to both you and the enemy. Aside from the height/terrain modifiers, you can also apply your own terrain modifiers. You can set fire, lay poison, or even spread water (and then electrify it) to help corral your enemy. Some abilities allow you to gain special abilities (or are themselves influenced) by the terrain of the battlefield. 

In addition to the characteristics of the terrain itself, the way you traverse the battlefield is also deep and engaging. Under the right circumstances, you no longer have to just walk square-by-square to your desired location. Original Sin tracks all characters' paths in meters (and does the same for ranged attacks/spells). Early in the game [spoiler] you gain the ability to teleport characters a moderate distance, with the only real limiting factors being they have to be in range and you have to be able to see where you're dropping them. 
 Characters also take some insignificant physical damage because they....well, they don't land so gracefully afterwards. I haven't tried it yet but I really want to do an all-archer party where they just keep leapfrogging each other around the battlefield while taking constant pot shots at the enemy. [/spoiler] 

Lastly, this game *rewards* strategic thinking. A very recent fight I had was drawing to a close. There was only one heavily damaged enemy left, but the character taking their turn (an archer) wasn't able to target the enemy due to lacking line of sight. In a normal Tactics RPG, I would have just hit ""end turn"" and had another character finish off the enemy. In Original Sin, I was able to [spoiler] teleport a nearby crate directly over the enemy. The crate did enough damage to kill the enemy, and the battle was over [/spoiler]. There's a TV trope article for stuff like that- ""Mundane made awesome.""

The [b]character customization[/b] in this game is second to none. you start with multiple races (Elf, human, dwarf, Lizardfolk, and undead versions of same). Each has their own unique inherent abilities. Once you've selected your race, you go on to add attributes to your character that in other games might be called ""classes,"" but that's only partially descriptive- you also have the six ""main stats"" common to most RPGs- Strength, Finesse (Dex) Con (HP), INT, Wit (wisdom- kinda), and Memory (which determines how many different spells or skills you can have ""ready to cast"" at a moments notice- If you've ever played a Cleric/Wizard in DnD 3.5, you'll quickly come to see how closely this game's magic system utilizes a ""spell slot"" mechanic that is quite similar).

Every character has access to all the different attributes and stats any other character does (some [i]are[/i] mutually exclusive though). How you build these attributes determines how effective, and in what ways, that character can use their skills. You can create a specialized archwizard who casts insanely good air-element spells with almost no ability in the other elements, or you can spread your points around to create a character that is able to learn (but not utilize, more on that later) nearly every spell in the game. In addition, higher-tier spells/skills require more points in their respective ""school."" Similar to multiclassing in DnD, you can choose to generalize or specialize to fit your specific play style. 

There are modifiers that affect the non-combat side of the game as well- you may select a number of ""tags"" that describe your character's upbringing, which will occasionally present you with additional dialogue options when interacting with NPCs.

These customization options are where Original Sin most deftly shows off how it drew inspiration from previous games while simultaneously modifying or improving on them to create something new and fitting- Guild Wars players will remember how much time and energy was once spent on mixing and matching your abilities from just two different classes to create a character that truly fit your play style. Original Sin allows you that same freedom and more.

All the above is great, and fun, and either of those two things alone would be enough to make this game stand out, but the final entry in this review is the [B]Dynamic Storytelling.[/b]

As with any game, your goal is to reach the end of the story. You do so by overcoming a number of specific objectives between you and your end goal. A ""Win Condition"" is arguably the single most basic principle of any and all gaming- even tic-tac-toe has a win condition. Gaming complexity increases as more and more objectives and opportunities are placed between the beginning of the story and the end. Remember all the different win/lose tracks in the original Wing Commander game?

This is where Original Sin 2 truly shines. Aside from getting yourself killed, there is almost no ""wrong"" way to play the game.

When a game starts with you locked in a dungeon, you assume the game has a very specific, orderly list of things you need to do to get out.

Original Sin 2 doesn't do that. If you like, you can just kick open the door, slaughter every guard that stands in your way, take their stuff, sell it to the NPC trader, then kill the NPC trader and get back (most) of the stuff you just sold, and kill some more guards (with a boost from the items you just got from the slaughtered NPC), until you finally kick down the castle gates. No one tries to stop you. Maybe there's no one left. You can escape the dungeon with the simple click of a mouse button.

But you're having too much fun, so you turn around and decide to continue your roaring rampage right up the corrupt Religious leader, or the gluttonous king, or maybe you're just really ticked off at the blacksmith who wanted to charge you four times what you had for a simple magic ring that, due to your overwhelming murder-pillage spree, you don't even need anymore.

[i]You can do it[/i]. I have a bad habit of turning over every nook and cranny, leaving no stone unturned. I am what some people might call a flower sniffer...but once I realized that straight-up murdering every living thing that crossed my path had next-to-no negative consequences (aside from the ever present video game risk of a game over screen) I wound up going back to thoroughly explore every bit of the map I could find, and in so doing, discovered a number of other ways in which the first major objective of the game could be accomplished.

And that was just my first 4 or 5 hours.

I have only one serious complaint- The buy/sell functionality is woefully inadequate, but i ran out of characters for this review",True

"(FINAL EDIT: Need to put one last main point atop this review. In DR1 and DR2, you killed zombies to get from point A to point B. They were the obstacle between you and your goal and were not a huge amount of fun to fight otherwise barring some gimmicks. In DR3, low level melee combat is visceral and fun and combo weapons have so much power that Lu Bu would approve of the amount of zombies you can kill in one swing, but almost always with visceral impacts and fun effects. If nothing else, DR3 has really made the zombies so much fun to kill that it's really fun to just pull up the game and kill zombies randomly. That's what is different between DR3 and the first two games. Yes, that costs a lot of what made 1 and 2 memorable, but it is fine for something different. Main review continues below.)

A lot of people don't like DR3 that much and I can understand why on some level. Gone are the cozy malls and most of the path-planning you had to do in DR1 and 2. Now you are just grabbing combo weapons and vehicles in some big murky GTA-style city sandbox that is not nearly as interesting because you have no reason to explore the various two room shops and houses as anything that's not a combo weapon is worthless. In every way this feels like a western made game as opposed to the tight Japanese design of DR1. That's not innately a bad thing, but you notice the differences.

Plus, the game has adopted the tone of a Scifi Channel b-movie, with wild tonal swings from horror to goofy comedy. When it works, the cheese is great. But it just ends up feeling a little off-putting at times... you know, like a Scifi Channel b-movie. This is especially evident in the bosses, who are purposefully designed to be grotesque and freakish, even more hideous than the zombies.

But on those bosses, they are some of the best of the franchise. And I love the DR1 bosses (The non-awful ones) to this day. There's hardly a bad fight in the bunch. Each telegraphs in a smart manner, giving your dodge roll a good workout, each has a clever gimmick that you can exploit to render them vulnerable to a grapple attack. The story bosses are elaborate set pieces in the absolute best possible way. At least three of them surprised me with how clever they were in including some gimmick set piece nonsense into the actual fight. I don't even want to spoil them by describing any of them.

The zombie abuse is still strong. The streets are packed with them, hundreds if not thousands, wall-to-wall, to be mowed down by your combo vehicles. In melee, the hits are satisfying and the zombies ragdoll well, and the gunplay is equally as good. Midboss zombies abound to tank hits, again with windups to their attacks for your dodge roll. Bonus points for allowing RT to fire guns or throw weapons at the nearest enemy without having to aim. Just throwing a bat across the room to thunk a zombie is a rare treat.

The port... well, I have a very nice computer and I am pretty sure I am not getting 60 FPS. Not much noticeable slowdown though but you are going to need something better than what ran DR2. Don't expect something hugely optimized, but I had no issues. I do not have a discerning eye for this sort of thing though. (EDIT: Let me be a bit clearer, from more experience. I do not think you could look at the framerate of this game and be at all impressed by it. I don't get thrown off by it, but it ain't silky smooth beauty. Not even close. No major performance issues though.)

I understand why people might be reluctant to try DR3. It's corny, it's kinda ugly, it's half a world away from the RE4-ish charm that made DR1 so memorable. And it's almost closer to GTA in design than Dead Rising... But give it a chance. If for nothing else, the boss fights are worth experiencing.

NOTE: This comes with all the DLC, except that fancy Super Turbo Arcade DLC. That DLC will remain XBONE exclusive sadly.

EDIT: Having played more, I have some more thoughts on the matter. The hack and slash zombie bashing gameplay is as strong as its ever been. And this game is stronger than any before in the franchise for really putting you up against an enormous, shambling horde of such magnitude that you wonder if you'll ever see the end of it. Ducking into a store, chasing by hundreds of zombies, and just swinging your way out until all your weapons are broken and you're fighting hand to hand, until everything is covered in zombie gore. These moments, DR3 does amazingly well.

I spoke too harshly of non-combo weapons. Combo weapons are all flatly better, but there's no metric that makes broadswords or sledgehammers or other normal weapons worthless. The RT-insta throw turns almost anything into a lethal one-use projectile that's surprisingly fun to use. In addition, being able to combine weapons in the field rids the game of DR2's ""hit up workbenches at every opportunity or else you will be gimped."" Several combo weapons are absurdly strong, and if you play the game optimally with caring to stock only amazing combos, you will never be in any serious danger, but if you avoid cheesing the game quite so viciously, you'll still have a good time. Everything from bosses to zombies is scaled smarter than DR2's ""Knife Gloves or go home"" balancing.

The game is at its weakest though when it is just making you drive from one end of the map to the other. The combo vehicles are incredibly strong, but navigating the same highway chokepoints blocking off the islands over and over is just boring, and if you marathon DR3 to try to really slam it out and not stop and enjoy the scrambling zombie slaughter on foot, you will burn out on the game. I did, and it took coming back later and just enjoying myself with it to really see what parts of it were good.

Finally, the game offers chapter select, which is a welcome addition for sandboxy play, as well as the DLC missions which have no time limit whatsoever, allowing a full sandbox experience.",True
"It's like Legend of Zelda, except remove the plot, and retain puzzles.

There are 4 ways to beat the game, and there's an additional bonus dungeon of hell in case you wanna go at it.

It's a short game, but it'll do for the price point.

P.S. Not for people who are not fond of block-pushing puzzles at all.

CONS: There's an in-game display quirk where it shows the wrong/default accept and cancel prompts if you reconfigured your keys.",True
"Fantastic game - reminds me of Diablo a lot what with all the equipment that drops and the sheer varition.  For those looking for a challenge there is the gauntlet which is basically a ""dive down as deep as you can till you die"" mode.  Otherwise you can play the story mode which has town building (getting your merchants, upgrading them, etc.) and dungeons you can select of varying difficulty levels.

The visuals are very charming; reminds me of shatterred planet which is a game that's probably not well known, but in short the 2D sprites and animations are just fantastic.

Enemies all have their own strategies and powers so it's never just about moving one grid point or waiting so you can hack them.  You'll get to know (and hate) a lot of them as they will use powers of their own to try and mess you up.

Equipment also has ranks (levels) and each piece levels up as you explore and/or use them.  So for example after firing my bow a few dozen times it can upgrade and get a new affix like +10% crit hit or something else random.  Very cool, I had one piece that had leveled up 4-5 times and was crazy good; very sad when I had to upgrade it.

The game runs on my potato computer too which is great.  Overall I'm very happy with my purchase, it's a game I'll play for hours on end.  I also have the mobile version but the PC version is much better as it is designed for one-time premium purchase and no IAP.",True

"The first time you pick up Kerbal Space Program, you might find it a little intimidating. This is normal. KSP is a robust rocketry simulator that does not suffer fools. However, even the failures are highly entertaining and this game does not stop being fun.

The first rocket you build may get a few kilometers up. The second, a little higher. You may reach space on a sub orbital trajectory after that, but soon, you will achieve stable orbit. It'll be then that you take a look beyond the shores of Kerbin, the Kerbal homeworld, and see the challenges ahead of you. The Mun, Duna, Eve and even the mighty Jool test your resolve.

I have been playing Kerbal for a long time now, since one of the early versions where you had the choice of a couple engines and a very twitchy stabilization system. Now you can research Mun rocks, build space stations and send probes all over the Kerbolar system.

For replayability, challenge and reward and the sheer amount of fun you have throwing Kerbals around at enormous velocities, I consider KSP to be a contender for the greatest game of all time.",True

"This game is very interesting. This is sort of like Heavy Rain and Juno, where the gameplay is mostly story with QTE (Quick Time Event) segments. The story I give a 7/10. Starts out kinda awkward but when Carla and Tyler come in it gets me hooked. Near the end the story takes a massive dive, but for the most part, playing this was definitely an experience worth having.

*SPOILERS*

OK, so when Lucas ""dies"" the first time, HOW DOES HE JUST KNOW ALL OF THAT CRAP? Like, he just knows about all the wizards and the high council and then he has total mastery of his Roblox-Matrix style powers? And then he fights the guy from the ""Mystery of the Druids"" game cover? And the plot just goes from a pretty good mystery to some lightning-fast roller-coaster ride of all this fantasy BS. Okokok, maybe they didn't have enough budget, but it just.... goes. It's like if your mom went from 0-60 in the minivan and you can't even get your seatbelt on because of the sheer level of acceleration. ""HONEY WE'RE GOIN' TO SOCCER PRACTICE, YOU'RE 10 MINUTES LATE!!!"" I mean, wow.

I would love to see a remake of this with additional gameplay and cutscenes to tell a more fulfilling story. I love the mystery feel of the early to mid-game, but then it just dives off a cliff. And don't even talk about that scene where they're underground in that train. I may not be quoting this right but,  ""His body....It's so cold."" yuck. Still can't get it out of my head.

Because of this game I learned how to navigate root folders in pc storage, basic C++, and how to spot a untrustworthy download link. 

Good fucking times.

Thank you devs, modders, and community for making this game so fun for me.",True
"Surprising immersive, addicting, and fun. The soundtrack alone makes it worth it.",True
"Let me start with a thank you to developers for adressing and fixing the issues that made the experience unpleasant for me. I am truly impressed with swiftness and quality of changes made after my negative feedback. 

 Stellar tactics is a work in progress, real time with turnbased combat mechanics, tactics (duh) game set in a sci-fi universe. Story is generic, but somehow easy to follow. So far there are 2 major game mods:

- Wandering around, fighting and exploring locations for loot, switching to turn based combat whenever enemy is sighted (Just like Wasteland, Fallout 1&2, etc etc)
- Flying around in your spaceship, exploring, traveling between quest hubs and missions.
Although spaceship part is nothing to brag about at the moment of this review, looks like soon there will be much more to it (mining, space battles, etc) 


Things I like about Stellar tactics:

- Randomly generated universe, hence replay value
- Character stats and skills, especially the way they improve (e.g. using rifles increase your rifles skill)
- Combat, nothing really new there, but somewhat satisfying
- Loads of weapons, armor and usable items, color coded for rarity with a clear tooltip
- Lighting and shadows look lovely
- Remade prologue mission looks great, very good job devs!
- Clean UI with helpful features like ""reload all"" button to make your whole squad reload their currently equipped weapon.
- Overall dameplay design and mechanics
- Regular updates and the way devs deal with feedback
- Pretty graphics

Things that I would love to see improved:

Character animations: 
- movement in particular. That half a second delay between clicking and your carachter starting to ""accelerate"" makes it feel weird, not responsive.
- Mozzle flash, to make shots feel ""crispier""
- Shot sounds are not bad, but not great either
- Invisible boxes around the characters, that prevent clicking on anyhting but the caracter. Have to twist the camera around a lot, especially when it gets crowded in melee or you need to move character just a little.
- Impact animation, for guns and melee weapons. Heavier weapons = heavier impact, e.g. Knife stab and chaingun volley look and feel different (sound and animation wise)
- Close/loose formation button, It sucks when enemy appears and one or of two of the characters are the whole turn away before can engage.
- Added and improved armor and weapon textures
- Simple cover syslem would be nice

Verdict:

I realize the game is in pre-alpha stage, but the work done so far is amazing, in my opinion. This project is definately worth to support. If you like tactics games like Extraterrastrials, Fallout 1, 2 & Tactics, Wasteland 2, etc, this is a game for you. Devs are doing a stellar (tehe) job, responding to feedback and with your support and frequent large updates, this will be a great game in no time.  8/10",True
Best city building game of all times.,True

"It has the makings of a great game, but it's bogged down with HORRIBLE enemy design and AI. The enemies are way stupid good at tracking your movement, and some enemies are straight up impossible to kill without taking damage using certain perks. Blessings are extremely unbalanced, ranging from ones that do literally nothing (I'm looking at you lucky) to ones that the game practically can't be beaten without. The bosses all have unique weaknesses, which is great, except they require certain builds, so if you have a melee heavy build you simply have no choice but to reset, as you have no chance of winning. Once especially egregious boss is one whose weakness is on top of it's head, which would be fine, except the walls are covered in poison so you can only reach it's head if you have the double jump perk, blessing, or the golden feather. The game is HEAVILY rng based and will often lock blessings and hidden levels behind rock walls you can't get through, since the game didn't give you a single bomb. Combat grinds to a fucking halt unless you have a ton of melee damage, since you have to hit and run if you don't feel like leaving it up to rng whether the enemy parries you and gets a free hit or not. 

Oh, and spikes will nearly insta-kill you, and many enemies, even on the first floor, can launch you at 300 miles per hour into them if you get hit so much as once.

It's infuriating, because the rest of it is so goddamn good.",True

"Rarely do I bother with a review..

TLDR; If you enjoyed the original, you will likely love this one. I do.

Some context -  I'm an old gamer. I'm an Elite Dangerous early backer (to recapture Elite from back in the BBC micro days). I also backed ""Descent Underground"" for the same reasons - nostalgia - for the days when low-ping-bast*rds and modems were a thing.

A while ago I re-bought all of the original Descent (1/2/3)  series (ty GoG) hoping to enjoy the replays. - Sadly, in my eyes, those games are just too dated on modern hardware.

This version, by the original Descent crew, has entirely captured the original feel, and If I'm being honest, more so than the similarly named 'Descent Underground"".

I'm looking forward to the full version and wondering what mutli-player is going to feel like.

Recommend on sale with deep discounting.

I sure would have been pissed if I paid full price for this. Having picked it up for $20, I'm just occasionally annoyed but playing. 

A good story as always, and I am looking forward to completing it. But the technical short-cutting is grating me in unexpected ways. I am getting over the fact that it doesn't work on my triple-screen monitor setup like every other modern game can do. Just the price we pay to have it on consoles that I will never use. But when I set everything to ULTRA so I can have an immersive experience and it cannot draw the lock-picking animation? 

Now I'm finding areas like the quarry where I just clip through rocks, a car factory where door textures are glitched and I just pass through, floating loot, what am I going to find next? This has been out for seven months, I would have expected a bug pass by now. 

The building was fun, until I figured out I could stack staircases togther and build an entire complex hanging out in the air with no support, it turned it from a sc-fi adventure to Garry's Mod. Different kind of fun, but totally immersion killing. 

Cannot recommend at the full price. To me it is just Fallout 3 with color and that is not a $60 game. Get it on sale (%67+ off ) like I did.

"Hitman: Codename 47 hasn't aged well

Back in 2000, it was a revolution for the stealth genre with a brand new type of stealth that no other stealth game did: social stealth. But now that the game is almost in his twenties, you can see a lot of problems with this game.

GRAPHICS:
The game is not very pleasant to look at with his almost 20 years old graphics.

GAMEPLAY:
The default setting is the numpad controls and there's a specific button to run, not like shift+w, when you press it, you just run forward. The aiming is absolute trash, my wiimote is more precise than the guns of this game. The AI vary between totally retarded and totally mentalist, sometimes they don't react to a guy receiving a bullet in the head, sometimes they know the every details of your face by just looking at a naked dead guy. THERE ARE NO SAVES!!!yeah i know there is a loading system but you are still compromised after a load so it's better to restart your 20 minutes long run... yeah some missions are really long.

LEVEL DESIGN:
This is the best part of the game in my opininon. IO-Interactive was always good at making levels, their first game isn't an exception, but the studio is still not flawless so this game also has his bad levels. My favorite was the Budapest level where you have to kill a terrorist and secure a bomb in a hotel. This level is probably the base of what the Hitman franchise became. Honourable Mention to the Hong Kong missions, as first levels, it set the tone of the entire franchise and they made an amazing job at making us feel like true Hitmen during these (plus the build up to the one giant mission is cool). The Golden Poop goes to the Rotterdam levels who switch from stealth game to kill everyone challenge. Dishonourable mention to the two first Colombia levels where it becomes Death Stranding for the N64 (not the third one, the third one is pretty decent). btw did I mentioned some missions were pretty linear.

STORY:
The story is pretty basic and kinda predictable, but at least they don't make it disappear in the middle of nowhere for no reason and only reintroduce it at the end of the game. Oh look it's the sequel of this game that everyone prefers over the third one for no good reason !

MUSIC:
Jesper Kyd... Yea dat's gud shit bro... Actually it's his weakest soundtrack but it's still Jesper Kyd...

Overall it's a pretty decent game that I absolutely love for being the first ""classic"" Hitman game I ever played. Objectively though, I don't really recommand it. Even if you're doing a Hitman marathon, you should just skip this one. Don't worry, all the missions (except Colombia and Romania) have been remade and sold with 6 unique levels in a pack called Hitman: Contracts. If you wanna see Colombia and Romania, you can still just watch Zevik or Centerstrain on YT.

"While on graphics, framerate, bugs, pathfinding, it's a little unpolished - early access, totally get it - it sure makes up for in not just mature content with excellent over-the-top [read awesome] character models, but a deeply awesome story line! Yeah, we all know why we got this game, lets not kid ourselfs. What makes this game attractive, in my opinion, is the ""thrill of the hunt"" element. It is surprisingly good at making you feel emotion toward the game play elements. (Maybe it's the voice acting) You really need to weigh your gameplay options too, if you mess up, just like in real life, you're probably not going to get much further. I'd happily pay more for a content loaded game like this. Giant kudos to the developer!

Couple quick suggestions on a wish list:
- Quick Save
- Or at least some type of autonaming scheme for the saves w/ screen shot of where you were at the time
- Debuging console

"If a Choose Your Own Adventure story got spliced with Animal Crossing with some ""HOW DO I LEARN ADULTING"". That's about what Night in the Woods is. It's part platformer and part horror(ish) adventure(ish) game with some rage worthy mini games (Hello Guitar Hero my old foe).

What it manages to do is tell the story of a dying middle to lower class town better than any ""Hillbilly Elegy"" that has been recently circulated just about everywhere. I'd know. I live in one. This matches my living situation a lot more than any blowhard trying to sum up things with some feigned sympathy. Possum Springs is a dying town. Mae Borowski has quit college to return home to something familiar. The unfortunate thing is, nothing is familiar. Stores she grew up with have shuttered and one of her childhood friends has gone missing. Then there's the questions of why... Why quit? What is Mae's life, anyway?

And you get to find that out.

The platforming isn't particularly hard and once you're dropped off into the game, you're given a very relaxing area to traverse to start to learn how to use the jumping. Not difficult and you also learn Mae will inspect things multiple times for many different responses and thoughts. Inspect things regularly. My gripes with the platforming, however, is that I really didn't get to do anything more fun and difficult until near when the game was ending. That was when new things were being introduced, like slipping off odd angles. I was disappointed there wasn't more once I had new, shiny things introduced. The basic dream levels were more so irritating because they were spaced out in a way that gave me about five seconds of raging. But nothing unique other than one or two things that get utilized once and quickly whisked away.

Talking to people in town is great and with some characters, will cost you precious time. But this is all about how you will uncover the history and darkness of Possum Springs. Budget your time wisely...and try to prioritize those you want to see so you can hear what they might have to add in your endeavors.

The way you interact with people can change how you view the town, but not how your core game plays. So choose your interactions wisely. Do you really want to be a jerk? Do you really want to do THE THING? YOU'RE GOING TO DO THE THING?

Night in the Woods is also particularly meme worthy. Mae and her three friends have a great script and they flow very naturally when they banter. Nothing feels very forced. Everything is something you would probably do with a friend or could be something you have said to your circle of friends before. While there are points where the game drags in the story, it'll punch back with something you probably should have seen coming. But you didn't so well, ghosts and stuff. I found Mae to be interesting, but she only really comes into her own later on in the game. You might find her somewhat unlikable at first and decide the rest of Possum Springs is a lot more interesting than he is. Stick with her, please. You'll be rooting for Mae's success and her triumphs.

I mean you might also want to start collecting some characters and put them in a basket while announcing ""Don't you ever look at my children AGAIN"" since this game details quite a few tough subjects. But I guess tough subjects are fine when you have cute animals as a platform right? In all honesty, they're dealt in a strangely tasteful way. Confessions of dark, painful things are done while drunk or with awkward one-on-one with a friend, then awkwardly pushed away now that feelings are out in the open. Congratulations. You managed to remind people that this is how we sometimes deal with uncomfortable topics. We blurt them out, laugh, change the subject. It's a way of coping and we do this as people. Thanks for remembering how people work. No sarcasm.

The game ends rather abruptly and leaves you wanting more. More answers. More of characters we only saw glimpses of. More about Mae's grandfather. More about everything. But with what does happen, there is at least some closure. Abrupt ending, but closure. We can at least give out points for closure.

This. Is not. Undertale. If someone told you this was ""the next Undertale"" I swear... No. The games are nothing alike. This is like watered down Mario with Animal Crossing and a big messy plot. If you ever wished characters in your Animal Crossing town had a tragic background and origin story, this is really something for you. Really. I know you're out there. However, this is best suited for jaded young adults who have been burnt by life (raise your hands) and are looking for something that's more like a hyperactive storybook that needs you to be slightly attentive and play a few mini games as you turn the page. If you're looking for something happy, you're in the wrong place.

I still really enjoyed it, even if hopping on telephone wires have completely wrecked my hands for the next few days. Such is the curse of gaming disabled.

there are additional maps after you beat the first. the first map dosent take very long. luckily there is more, just go back to main menu then load to see the new area available. the game is rather easy, if you play it on hard mode it gets a good bit more challenging, especially on the second map, really fast paced moving and shooting to keep from getting killed. I recomend playing it on hard.",True

"My poor ass is raw. pls gief cream...

Age of Decadence is the type of game that will look rather low key in terms of graphics, yet delivers on hard gameplay and rich story.

It's bloody rewarding though, you'll feel real accomplishment when you win a tough fight or progress through a rather tricky part of the story. The story itself is highly enjoyable. Doesn't give to much away, letting you slowly soak up the rather rich (and depressing) lore of how the world has gone to shit. (Makes the fall of the Western Roman Empire seem like a ride in the park)
Plus I love history, so the fact the dev's have used the fall of ancient rome as their basis makes me moist.

I can't speak to replay value yet. I'm skeptical. Replaying on a higher difficulty rarely adds much to a game for me. We'll see with this one. Customizing your team is intriguing, but I don't see bothering with arbitray acheivements to collect them all.

I have to commend the core gameplay design, combining chess-like planning with some strategy/RPG progression. It's unique. It's not simply move your tank out front, stagger your backline sniper/archer at a long angle, and stunlock/take cover from the rest. It's more varied. First off, you don't have a clearly split battlefield, defending one side from the other. Your structures, units, and enemies are scattered throughout the grid. I also appreciated that by the end, 2 of my 3 unites played quite differently from how they started. My conservative, punchy pushing mech (the 'Prime') became a flying harbringer of laser death, trading out the push mechanic entirely. Throughout, I was challlenged to think differently from most other games or puzzles. That alone is arguably worth the price.

Art style: fantastic. Well done.

It's polished. Rules and objectives are clear. The allowance of 1 redo per battle, but only 1, and only before submitting 'end turn', is perfect. Less would be brutal, more would trivialize encounters. Everything has its place. It doesnt bog you down with a cumbersome inventory or anything like that. The UI is smooth and sensible. Honestly there should be awards just for that.

It lacks content though. The end sequence was nice, but lacked punch (somehow didn't even have a boss, at least in my playthrough). You should play it, it deserves praise, but as far as I can tell so far, it's just too damn short. I'll see if the novel gameplay holds up to a few replays.

"Decided to give a little more of an indepth review since there doesn't seem to be many of them.

1. Crafting: 
     - Building: You can craft pretty much whatever you want to build out of. Cobblestone, brick, prick paver for a pool, stone, whatever. 
     - Traps: You can also craft pipe bombs, sharpened sticks, land mines, use spider webs, anything to help fortify your hold.
     - Food: Yes you can make multiple kinds of food though a cooking and items like gas cans through the chemistry system. 
     - Aestetics: What fun is the zombie apocolypse if you can't have pretty things in your house? You can now craft items (or steal them, and tv's/paintings from rich people), to decorate your house!

2. Fighting:
     - Players: ALWAYS fun
     - Zombies: The way the game is set up the person who hosts (if they choose to host) gets to set the ""difficulty"" This is an actually impressive customized system. The host is able to set anything from zombies: How many zombies, how hard they hit, if there will be zombies at all (thats right you can turn off zombies and other enemies COMPLETLY if you just want a  pvp game) and if the zombies will run or not. It also lets the host decide how the day/night cycle is handled, if there will be more light than dark, etc. Also how many hits blocks take to break, and more. It lets you and your friends (or just you) have a customized experience. For added fun turn down the damage you do, increase the zombie health, make night predominent 
and turn on running. Oh and increase the spawn rate of  zombies by 200%, really, trust me,  it's so fun.
     - Weapons: Many different types of weapons including guns (snipers rifle, shotgun, piston, machine gun), crossbows, melee weapons, or if you're feeling like just plowing through people, pull out a chainsaw or auger.

3. Ambience: The background noise for this game is ridiculous. It actually has made me jump a few times. Nothing like being in the middle of a ruined city, hearing the wind blow around you and then..a baby's scream.

This game updates VERY often, and really does listen to the community. The developers really seem to care about this game, and i've been very impressed with it so far. 

One of the biggest concerns I had with this game before I bought it though was the ability to play on a server with JUST my friends. This game lets one of your friends ""host"" a game and load up a server just for your friends, so have no fear! Also an added bonus is the fact you can CHANGE GAME settings whenever you load it back up. All your progress is saved AND you can change it. Finding zombies to much? Easy log out, reload and change it.",True

"[h1]Awesome remake![/h1]

Great graphics and framerate, cross platform support (albeit so-so but playable  performance on LInux; tested on a 550-Ti; I blame Unity.) Although it is a very good remake, I felt that the game is not as ""solid"" as the original, rather than making a good/bad list let's just compare the game to the originals thoroughly.

[b]Playthrough time comparison[/b]
Original: 10 hours (saving almost all the 100 mudokons)
New 'n' Tasty: 8 hours (saving 159(52%) of the 300 mudokons; but it wasn't long since I finished the original again)

Expect roughly 10 hours on your first run if you've never played the original, 8 hours if you recently did. You will want to play this game with a controller, if you didn't know. Any PS style or Xbox style controller should be fine. (Or maybe the steam controller?)
-
The atmosphere is lighter than in the original Oddysee (think back to the atmosphere of Exoddus; it's more like the atmosphere in that game) besides the more brightly lit, warmer colored environments, the voice acting played a big role in this, the voice actors were trying to make comical voices whereas in the originals everyone sounded more depressed, especially the protagonist. As a fan of the originals I did not like the new slig voices, that's what stood out to me the most. As for the mudokons, most of them sounded the part. I hear that for teh lulz they had different voice actors for most of the mudokons in the game. For someone who never played the original (or played it ages ago) this may not really matter, but a lot of the original fans liked the game for the dark atmosphere.

Chase camera (instead of stage camera) this was a sort of ""get with the times"" featuer, but the stage camera was a very important element in a lot of the puzzles but most noticably what bothered me I will mention next.
-
Sligs can no longer outrun your chant, i.e. when you would try to possess sligs in the original games, sometimes they would run outside of the stage you were positioned in to escape your chant, in this game the equivalent would have been to run outside of your field of view, but sligs are unable to do that (and this sometimes looks incredibly awkward) the up (or down) side of this is that it makes the game significantly easier at some parts.
-
Sligs don't instantly drop dead when shot anymore (slogs luckily still do though) this was all for a feature so that you could keep shooting them until they explode. They designed the levels so it wouldn't pose a problem (at most you're shooting 3 sligs at a time) but in Exoddus where there's more of them, this would be a bit bothersome for sure.
-
Some puzzles were changed or removed, new ones were also added here and there. Unless you knew the original like the back of your hand you will rarely notice this.
-
Health system; since there is now health in the game you can survive some fall damage and shots from sligs this time around (it's an easier game) however there is a hard mode which brings this closer to the original, but I noticed one major flaw in this hard mode which is thatin the original, your health (which only affected bats and bees and similar minor threats) would regenerate to full in a couple of seconds after you have not been taking any damage (or transition between stages) and of course when you die. There was no visible health, it was just a ""how many hits you can take from this thing before dying"" sort of thing. For players that didn't play the original, play on normal and everything will be goody goody,  But for others you will probably only notice this annoyance if you play on hard when you are in the paramonian temple where you need to jump between some swinging rocks and bats will attack you once you make the jump (I was stuck for a long time) I'm gonna report this as a bug though, so hopefully they will change it.
-
Controls are rather different now and there is no ""legacy mode"" for the controls as is. By default now your character will run instead of walk (unless you use an analogue stick to walk) this I didn't like at all, but luckily there was an option in the menus called ""button to run"". Similarly the jumping button in the originals would jump forward, in this game it jumps straight up unless you are running forward. There was also an option to fix this called ""sideways hop"" which brings us very close to the legacy control scheme with the exception of (of course) the speech which is now bound to the D-Pad insteaad of a complex mix of shoulder and main buttons, this I considered a non-issue though. My biggest complaint after setting the options right was that running was set to the lower left shoulder which on xbox style controllers is a trigger button, triggers are a pain in the neck to hold down for extended durations but I struggled through it (although i would have loved an option to switch it around so that sneaking and running would be on L1 and R1 and throwing and alt-speech would be on R2 and L2, it's more convenient and makes more sense to put throwing on a trigger button than a regular one.
-
Quicksave system; this was in the Exoddus games but not the original Oddysse game this one is based off which brings some minor implications. Overall I liked the quicksave system in exoddus so I liked the concept of having an quicksave system in this game, however it wasn't set up as elegantly as in exoddus, in exoddus you could quicksave, then next time you'd die you'd respawn where you quicksaved.  In this game you will always respawn at the last checkpoint when you die unless you specifically load the quicksave after you die either by accessing it from the menus or holding down the select button (which is also the quicksave button). In other words, quicksaving could have been better implemented, but at the very least it was implemented which is good enough.
-
Ragdoll effects, in the original games you either blew up or turned into a steaming pile of meat when you died (yes it was funny) now instead of getting that ""steaming pile of meat"" effect we have ragdoll effects, but I really miss that sound we always got when we died in the original, the ""steam"" sound . It was totally silly but it was one of these things that was actually funny about the game. I guess it's mostly because this game is 3D and the original was 2D that they couldn't keep it in this one but the ragdoll effects are very generic and I didn't feel they added anything to the game in the end so I would have preferred something totally stupid like what I described over the ragdolls personally, but it's a minor thing.
-
Soundtrack timings are not as good as in the original (and I also could swear that there were some missing tracks, but it might just be that some tracks weren't always played when they should/would have in the originals) I also noticed that sometimes sound effects don't play (clearly that's a bug to be fixed though)
-
You can't always carry items between stages whereas in the original you could.
-
UXB (Toggleable) Mines are more difficult (While they all follow the same pattern in this game; the time to press is different than in the originals in the way that you have to super precisely time it just a millisecond before the long green beep, in the originals you had to press it as soon as the beep sound is heard, rather than before it is actually heard)
-

That's pretty much it for the comparison to the original. My only major complaint is that the slaves don't sound that tormented, and besides the times they're beaten on-screen, they don't look that bad-off (there isn't blood all over the floors and walls like in the original; as I said before, lighter atmosphere)

"This game has no words to really describe it to its full extent. It's beautiful in every way possible from the story line (which may be very confusing), to the scenery and the choreographed fights (many of which are confined to beautiful settings). The story dives deep into a rabbit hole of confusion, self-guilt, self-doubt and mental suffering. Which as I said before can be VERY confusing and almost impossible to understand fully. I may have to play it through again to fully grasp this content. Very worth the wait and very worthwhile playing. The only bad thing I can say is at times the fighting gets so claustrophobic and overwhelming it's almost a pain in the ass. Oh, and the flashing lights. The lights. Oh my dear god the lights. I'm not even Epileptic and this fried my brain throughout my playtime (and it gradually gets worse throughout the game and tops out at the end). Overall I give it a solid 8/10. 9/10 if they calm it down with THE LIGHTING. Big thumbs up. Cannot wait for the next title.",True

+Gamplay feels great, i mean actual shooting, not VATS. Its smoother faster, i like it. Vats is in slow mo´ gives you a pressure feeling
+Bethesda learned that there are colors! The wastland is damm sexy with that colorful dress
+A big map to explore giving you hundreds of hours of gamplay
+A bunch of intreasting companions, each with unique things to say or to do! One has more lockpicing and hacking level level, dogmeat will never hate you doesnt matter what you do, Others have grat combat skills etc.
+More intresting characters
+Forget you are outside the screen
+Minecraft building is grat, a nice little adition
+A pretty good main story (For bethesda games)
I have sure missed something else
Cons:
-Its a improved Fallout 3, nothing new to the table
-There is less freedom, moast of the characters just lay on the ground. There is no posibility to be bad, you are always the good guy. 
-Conversations are kinda usless, becouse moast of the time it ends to the same thing. I tried to convince Spoiler to dont attack me, using the most nice things to say, but at the end he still tries to kill me. Thats something that was done great by Fallout 1 and 2, using the dialog at your advantage
- Drugs and power armor are OP, a fusion core is a common thing, drugs dont cost much and neither the curing addiction
-Mediocre Graphics

"This not really a bad game, but I'm not a fan. The story is..ok at best. Each location has a 'backstory' that is all of five scentences, and the plot of the game itself is mediocre. The character backstory is extremely cliched as well. I will say the premise of the game, the idea, is really unique, though. That, and the game is really pretty with lots of colors, and a neat style. What kills this game for me is the gameplay. It is a typical hack and slash, so you'd expect it to be repetative, but this one is really bad. Tha main issue is that there are probably only ten different enemies, and none of tham are really interesting to fight. So, that's my issue. It's decent, but the gameplay made it really hard to get though.

I've come back after beating the game now, and I still feel mmostly the same. The story ends up being a little bit more interesting but ends with a really fall-flat two-way choice that kinda kills the ending too. I really, really wanted to like this game, but it's pretty hard to.",False

"No, the down thumb is not because of the fandom.

It's because I think it's not even worth a quarter of what the creator charges for this game. $10 is ludicrious. And for so little content. Let me break this down.

Gameplay: This always comes first for me. And there's not much of it in this game. I do have to say that combining bullet dodging mechanics and RPG elements is pretty neat, but it feels so unfinished and lacking that it becomes repetitive within the first few minutes of playing. You get the option to fight or spare enemies. Fighting is nothing more than a quick time event where you line up a bar and sparing is a set of pre-defined choices for every type of enemy. Neither is any more complex than the other. Some bosses introduce a gimmick to this system like turning the dodging mechanic to a jumping game, but disappears after that. The overworld puzzles are equally lacking. If you've played RPGs before, you know what to expect. I don't know what else to say about the gameplay other than it just is not very interesting. It starts promising and then quickly becomes a chore with every random encounter.

Difficulty: Aside from the final boss of the genocide route (the path to get to him being an incredibly boring grindfest by the way), nothing in this game poses a challenge in any sense. The final boss of the normal route even gives up at the end where your hits start to do more damage in a blatantly scripted way, no matter what you do. The final boss of the true route can't even kill you. Literally everything there is scripted. Zero challenge.

Characters: Annoying. I don't know what else to say about them. Especially Temmie and the yellow one in the lab. Did I mention that you can't even kill her in the genocide route? The comic sans skeleton and tsundere-plane or whatever that enemy is called is telling of what kind of idiotic meme humor Toby Fox appreciates.

Length: About 7-8 hours on average, I'd say. There's not much in the way of content.

Replayability: Not sure why anyone would want to sit through this twice. Like I said, gameplay is bare bones. If you want to come back for the genocide route, you should know that it is deliberately made boring to be in line with the pacifist message that it loves to preach. You have to grind every single monster.

Story: It's not great. Your friends come to save you in the end. And also I find the sparing message to be very two faced and obnoxious. Don't defend yourself if you get attacked? Don't have fun in an RPG? Whatever Toby Fox is trying to say, it doesn't work on me.

Graphics: Barely presentable. As minimal as minimal can be. I'm of the stance that you can't judge a game by its graphics, but I can't find any genuine effort invested in the visuals compared to other indie developers.

Music: It's the only good about this game I feel, but it's also wildly inconsistent. Also, I don't find chiptune to be very appealing in this day and age.

Overall: This game is the best example of style over substance. It focuses too much on its quirks and laughs at its own jokes to be enjoyable to me. It barely even meets the qualifications to be a video game anyways. Undertale has its beginnings with the MOTHER series (or Earthbound as it is known in the West) and you can definitely see how much of that series has rubbed off on this game. I feel that this game was made with the main intent to reproduce that style of Earthbound rather than make a game that can stand on its own. Undertale, unfortunately, falls flat everywhere. It doesn't do much for me.

Verdict: Not recommended. It is average at best. Nothing really special. And if you think I'm being too harsh on a solo developer, remember he's charging $10 for what is essentially a MOTHER clone/homage/tribute. Made in Game Maker, no less. Save your money. There's not much actual game here.

P.S. - As for this game's way of ""remembering"" what you've done, there's a game that does that way better. Look for 999 for Nintendo DS. In fact, whatever this game offers in terms of systems has been done way better by other games. For instance, Super Mario Superstar Saga for GBA had actual interactivity more than just lining up a bar to hit in its RPG battles. And the Touhou games (as much as I hate hearing about that series) practically defined the bullet hell genre today.",False

"The main quest is decent but the sidequests are often too buggy to actually finish.

The choice of having two main characters is very odd and it doesn't work at all. You end up becoming attached to one of them and swear as soon as you're forced to play as the other one.

You're stading on a ledge, looking down on an enemy and thinking: ""damn, this is a good spot to snipe with a throwing blade"". You aim at him and press the button to throw a dagger. However, your character jumps down and melee kills the enemy instead - alerting every guard in the entire area. The button to fire/throw is the same button as doing a jumping assassination.

Intel Core i5 3337U
nVidia GeForce GT 720M (yep, it's a laptop)

The only thing is that it is really demanding of your system, for example when you have a huge number of blocks on screen, or you have a large factory with a large stockpile of parts /resources on screen or have complex sorting and retrieval systems, and the game tries to run them, sometimes causes lots of CPU load. I have a very powerful rig CPU: 6600K 4.75Ghz OC, Memory: 32GB 3200Mhz  low timings, GPU:GTX1080 8GB OC, 2.15Ghz core and 11Ghz effective Mem. SSD Samsung Evo 850Pro 512GB, 2TB Seagate HDD and there where times when the game would choke up when I ran the automated assembly line, the conveyors would bug out sometimes as well, sometimes I had to drive around and sweep the map with my miner/part collector to clear up the performance issues. 
That said for an early access game I have gotten my monies worth out of it for sure. really hope that they expand the faction play and maybe add a large coop world mode to say invade a faction planet or area with a lot of combat etc. would be cool, AI is utterly incapable of using fliers at the moment, so once you learn how to build them/fly them it is very easy to dominate the AI using fliers.",True

"Religion, damn it can be scary.

This game proves that.

It's no Outlast, but it's a distant contender. It'll keep you entertained with its various spooky shambling patrolling creeps, the ocasional ""booya caught you!"" followed by running around like a lunatic trying to hide. The occasional situation where you need to move a box to a certain location to jump onto a ladder or ledge. Y'know, that kind of stuff.

And there's the persistent darkness which forces you to use a little night-vision camcorder, which needs batteries, which gives you that fear of running out of power (there's tonnes of batteries don't fret). 

And there's all the gore and shit. 

I'd recommend you play the first two games of the Penumbra series, Amnesia the Dark Descent (and Outlast 1) before this game to be honest, just because they will provide you that insidious threatening horror that you might be looking for.",True

"I knew I was a fan ever since I first laid eyes on one of the most intriguing trailers ever made, a bare 26 seconds of the first preview on Steam was definitive proof that love at first sight could be translated to a video game.

Firewatch as an experience has so much to offer, be it through quirky conversations, the relationships, the story-line beautifully backed up by a neat little preface or the picturesque lands you vow to protect. The amalgamation of all these perfect ingredients serve to burn as a memory you hold so dear but want to get rid of so you could re-live the whole Firewatch experience afresh.

[h1] Art [/h1]
Goes without saying that the art-style of Firewatch is indeed extremely captivating and a unique identifier by itself. Though not a fan of ""walking simulators"", I somehow managed to find the explorer in me and forced myself to traverse over lands I wasn't invited to. As days pass by, you're able to cut through areas that weren't accessible as you only get your hands on an axe only later on in the game, which in my opinion, was a nifty left mechanic to keep that exploration curiosity ignited.

[h1] Story [/h1]
I can not stress enough on how Firewatch makes you feel feelings and everything leading up to completion is a work of art both in its literal and figurative sense. The relationship between Henry & Delilah through their witful conversations and tone make you believe the tale from a literal standpoint and not something recorded in a studio over a script.

Overall, Firewatch left me speechless and wanting more and is definitely something I want to re-experience after I hit myself in the head really hard.",True

"It all started when I somehow got to play the demo of Supraland. There was something in this game that hooked me right-away. I love metroidvania and puzzle games, and also am a fan of FPS games. All of these elements come together in a beautiful way in Supraland.
Supraland is a mixture of metroidvania, exploration and puzzle solving with a bit of combat involved. Each power unlocks open up a whole perspective of the map you haven't seen before. This game rewards exploration so much that people who like to explore games to their fullest will savor it.

"The game in my opinion was fantastic. However, there are some problems that either frustrates me or just straight up problematic in my opinion.

[h1]The list below are the problems I have from the game (ordered from least to most annoying one):[/h1]

*Precision Aim: At first I like the idea of being able to use a weapon zoom in this game. Enabling it however, would disable homing capabilities which can be a pain if you're trying to hit something with the missiles installed for the Thunderhawk. In addition, in order to get that homing ability back, you have to first disable the Precision Aim mod and then restart the game. Which comes to the next problem I have with restarting the game.

*Unskippable Intro: it can be a pain at times when there's a problem you encounter in the game and that the next step after you do some reconfiguration is to restart the game. The game always opens with an unnecessarily long intro that cannot be skipped. It's not even used as makeshift loading screen, as you will be met with an actual loading screen after anyways, so why? 

If it's unskippable for the first time you play the game so that the new players would just appreciate the introduction of the game, fine. But, the fact that it stays unskippable, regardless if you have already seen it for the 1000th time? That's getting a bit annoying. Especially, when you are just trying to restart the game to see if you have resolved a problem that you tried to fix.

*Boat Walk Speed: I don't think this needs any further elaboration considering everyone who have this game would have felt it at one point. Not to mention the fact that you can't duck in this game so if you happen to be in a conflict, just hope that you either are close to the edge of the boat so you can dive underwater to save yourself from attack or a Bavarium wingsuit to fly away instead. 

Because if those situations are not available to you, well good luck surviving the amount of shots you'll have to swallow, hiding behind the boat's wheels won't save you either if you have to face cannon shots from other boats and missiles fired by helicopters at you.

[h1]Improvements and Additions that I would hope seeing if this game were to be revisited out of nowhere[/h1]

- Precision Aim mod bug fix would be nice of course. Even though, now I have gotten used to aiming without it anyways.

- New Game Plus or Chapter Replays, I have enjoyed going through the story and felt that I want to do it over again with all the stuff I got because as much as [spoiler]Sandbox is nice and all with the re-oppression system[/spoiler], but, I am curious about the amount of ways you could do to screw around with the game's story while using the stuff you've earned so far.

- [spoiler] Addition of the Little General to be available through Rebel Drop or at least a fast travel to the Volcano (or hell both would be better). It's a bit of a pain to always have to go to the crash site just to get the guns, in case you lose or trade it with another weapon out of whatever reason. [/spoiler]

[h1]Overall...[/h1]

Despite all the problems I've had with the game itself, I still feel that this game was incredible when it comes to its gameplay. It provides us with a wide array of ways you can complete the game's objectives. Whether it be blasting through using helicopters, tanks and calling down airstrikes, or cause immense chaos by using an armed wingsuit, telekinetic mechs and cause lightning strikes from the sky.

All the kind of things I would expect from a game where you could blow up bridges and hijack high speed vehicles like aircrafts with grappling hooks.

"So there is a new enemy type which fits perfectly but considering the originals story revolves around the enemies being resurrected it should have been there in the first game and the enemy placement changes only occurr after level 2 meaning you're still fighting charging enemies in tight corridor areas which is simply bad level design.

There is a new weapon which is that energy sword from shadow warrior 2 (the bad one) and yes, it is a melee weapon in an FPS (first person shooter). Though the bosses are a lot more balanced now that you have a dodge function and infinite running instead of a short sprint that lasts less than 10 seconds and is slower than the 2nd bosses beam attack, making it a very painful fight (which revolves around fighting minions more than him). 

I do not enjoy this game much BUT if you've not played this or the original then this is a definite improvement but it's not enough to make me like it. Also there's new sounds and music in the cutscenes which WOULD be nice if they didn't overright the dialogue which is far more important. It should be quieter and subtle in the background so you hear the dialogue first and music second not struggle to hear what they're saying but since it's got subtitles I guess they neglected the importance of dialogue.",False

"Cool concept but there are too many imbalances in the game the creators refuse to fix.  Killers are overpowered. Even without perks on, the killer can get all four sacrifices easily.  A killer can afk the entire match and receive the same points as you in a single game.  Otherwise the killer, trying, receives 3x as many points as you will as a survivor.  The BIGGEST flaw is there is no central hub like a normal game would have.  So, your ping is completely based off of the killer's and if they aren't in the same region as you, expect a disconnect.  They have gotten a little better with the disconnects and fixed item loss in general. EDITED: they now have created killers, that are far more imbalanced than survivors. I have 400 hours into this game and I really don't know why I keep playing.  A few killers can hit you across the map with ease and some can even hit you through buildings, yet the programmer team insists on trimming away at the survivor perks. If you are looking for a game that you will not win at, but like the Halloween movie killer concept, this is a solid game. Again, do not expect to ""win"" as a survivor, ever.",False

I bought this game for me and 2 other friends, and it's a pretty good game. The community of players are really cool. If you like survival games, you might want to give this title a go.

Exactly! For 9 bucks you get a pretty good game and If the dev's keep up with this game like they already are, you'll be happy you grabbed the game. OMG IT'S A MAN EATING BEAR!!! RUN!!! *mauled to death* Is he just camping my dead body sniffing my booty? I do believe so! The game has loot runs for all you horders like myself, cars, air drops, and missions. So come squat around the campfire, eat some honey and listen to  Haraldo strum you the finest of tunes on his dusty guitar, all because you're exiled for running over and killing an npc, and marked a traitor for 1 hour, leaving you helpless to fend for food and water off the land because all the other npcs want to kill you on sight.

"I just finished the first boss battle and am 15-20 mins into the second area, so I thought it would be a good time to write a review:

Overall this is an exceptionally strange and wonderful game!  It is definitely unique and very abstract, both in the story and in the way the gameplay mechanics are laid out.  Same goes for the graphics which you can see from the vids and screens.  

I have played many an RPG/Action title with a similar control type (move around, dodge/parry, attack heavy or light, etc.) but this one actually took me 30-40 minutes just to get down.  My first tip is to rebind the controls to whatever is comfortable for you (I used a controller and can't imagine a KB/M setup, but I haven't tried it, so...). The default setup was very difficult for me to manage, and I think if the buttons and triggers were not customizable, I would probably not be able to play the game.  Luckily they are, and either a souls-like setup (R1R2 weak/heavy and A or B dodge) or an ARPG setup (XY weak/heavy and A, B, or R2 dodge) work just fine. 

The game does a pretty good job of explaining the game systems and mechanics, but there are a couple of things that I had to go to the discussion boards to get clarified. The main one is that the first two slots in your inventory screen, which are used for weapon/skill type things that the game calls ""mantras"", are not clear as far as how they affect your actions/button presses. Further, you can slot the same mantra in the first two circles and I did not see or hear anything in the tutorial about what exactly they do.  So, I went to the discussion board and found out that the first handles the regular and charge attack using the light/weak attack button and the second handles the same for the heavy/strong attack button.  The different charge attacks occur when you hold down the weak or strong attack button for 2-3 seconds. This results in a sort of spastic explosion type thing of varying size and type that you can do 2-3 times before your charge meter runs out.  You then attack several times to fill the meter back up and do it all over again.  All of the different mantras have various different weak/strong/charge attacks, so I think of them more like weapons than skills, but you can decide for yourself.

Anyway, that's just one of several fairly complex mechanics that the devs came up with.  Bottom line, the game is really fun as long as you take the time to learn the ropes, and I'm definitely glad I took the time to do so.

I would be amiss not to mention the story, but it is so out there and fractured that it sounds like it actually takes a couple of playthroughs to get the whole picture.  This is fine by me personally, and I have really enjoyed the story so far, but if this bothers you then certainly take this into consideration before buying.  Also there are very heavy themes involving religion, psychosis, and nightmares.  It is definitely not a light-hearted story!.

In letter grades, I would give this game a solid B+, which I would gladly raise to an A- if the tutorial was a bit more comprehensive.  It's not every day, or even every year that you come across a game that is both truly unique and also fun to play, and this one definitely checks off both boxes!

"Okey lets  talk straight.
If you are a fan of Total war in general,you will not be enthusiastic about this game. It does not have the kind of complexity  previous total war games had,at least at this stage.
But, if you are a fan of fantasy strategy games or a warhammer fan this game is excellent.
First of all,different races means different play style. 
The naked edition has Ork,Dwarves,humans,undead,each of them completely different. 
The graphics are nice and if you spend  some money you might get the ""bloody edition"".
The battles are trully epic, in a scale you havent seen in any other fantasy game. 
And now the negative part:
The price. Its still very high. Also its about 17 euro each race which means you can spend about 100 bucks for the whole experience. I believe that the price of the expansions will fall in the next few months.
But the thing is that playing the game without the DLCs will take you hours, so the dlcs can wait. 

In conclusion,buy this game if you are a fantasy, warhammer fan and you like battles where spells ,cannonballs,dragons clash with each other. Buy this game if you say ""wow I am so bored to play another human faction slighty different than the rest""  (because in the original total war,that was the case). And of course buy this game if its on discount.

This has happened to me one times too many now, so I felt frustrated for having to wait so long to enjoy a game.

 It is easy to say that I am in the wrong here, that probably my behavior in the competitive games was bad and I deserved the (almost a month now) competitive cooldown, but I assure you that is not the case. 
 I happened to stumble across some of the most toxic players in my teams, and while I was trying to kick them via vote, I realised that, in most cases, the rest of the players were  friends, so I got kicked instead.
 I suspect that depending on the amount of kicks you have gathered, you get sort of ""blacklisted"" in the matchmaking process and the teams you end up being paired with consist of other blacklisted players (for various reasons), resulting in bad gameplay experience, and frustrating in-game situations.
 Being the victim of (gamewise) such an unfortunate chain of events, in order to avoid further frustration I felt there was no other choice for me than to uninstall the game and write this complaint.

Thank you for taking the time to read it.",False

"I bought this game expecting a good story.
It starts off interesting enough, you're a cybog detective who gets a call from his dead son. You go to his apartment, find his body, and the game severely drops off from there.

Now I thought the game would start to give hints to the player on who killed the son, or who the muderer is, or have you hunt down clues, but nope. You go talk to two doors, and then you start running through doors, and did I mention this game loves doors?

From this point on the writers shat on the script, and instead of following any coherent plot, you run through lots of doors. There are spooky noises, flashy effects, and talking. You run through more doors. None of this is part of the story. What does this have to do with a cyberpunk murder mystery? I don't know, but I hope you enjoy doors.

Go look up ""observer full playthrough"" on youtube. Skip around the video. The game is all doors and dark corridors, minimal story. This is a cheap scares haunted house thrill ride, and not the plot rich game I expected it to be.

I hope you like doors.",False
Lots of variety of different forms of game play and unique visuals,True
"I'm normaly too lazy to bother to write a review for a game... But I'll make an exception.

Shovel Knight is easily one of the best games I've ever played, and no doubt, my favorite platformer. It manages to make a perfect mix of engaging, fun mechanics, challenging difficulty that values actual skill above anything else, a nostalgic, but at the same time modern look, an amazing soundtrack and a sprinkle of simple, good humor.

I bought this game when only the Shovel Knight story was out, and it was easily worth its full price. Even if short, the game was very engaging, and just a real joy to play.

Then Plague Knight's story came out. When I saw it, I thought 'Oh, cool! I might buy this some time, maybe.' Then I realized that it was free, and thought that maybe it was just a reskin of the base game... I was very wrong.

Plague of Shadows was an absolute rework of the game. It kept the same world, with a story that, while not breaking the main one, was still very engaging and a joy to follow; most importantly, though, it brought a whole new set of mechanics, changing gameplay to something not just different to the main game, but also just as original as Shovel Knight itself had been before. I had paid for 1 good quality game, and received 2 games I dare call masterpieces.

And now Specter of Torment came out, and with just what I have played of it so far, I'll have to correct my previous statement. I received not 2, but 3 masterful games, with a fourth one on the way!

This isn't a game that you'll just play, have some fun with, and then just forget about. This is a game you can, and will, thoroughly enjoy.

Yacht Club Games, just for the ammount of care and quality that can be found in simply this game, are just a cut above most other developers.",True

"don't recommend unless you want a terrible addiction. For how i only have 20 hours compared to people with 800+ i have learned a valuable lesson to not play this game, for it is a addiction of cursing and getting mad at people for doing something as simple as not breaking one stone node, as my friends have detached from one other because of this game. my friends are like two separate groups now, one that plays rust non stop from 9 am to 12 am to the others that like to hang out during lunch and talk about fun things to do. This game is a curse far worse than hell.",False

"I purchased this game by itself without the Season Pass in the recent Summer Sale and honestly I am really surprised how long it actually was.

After 23 Hours I finally finished the Main Campaign of the game which honestly was very interesting and lovely.

First of all if you haven't played any of the previous Tomb Raider reboots I recommend you go do so, as the story of this third one is connected to the previous ones.

The Atmosphere was great and the graphics were amazing. Not only did they look good but they also have RTX option available in the game, not only for the graphics itself but also for its rendering, which honestly I felt was a little blurry so I left it off.

Only one thing in the whole Game annoyed me and I just wanna put it out here before I praise the game for it being amazing as it was. The most annoying thing was that sometimes during cutscenes it would either stutter, go fast forward, freeze and the audio would come out of sync.

Lara is back and she got some new tricks. Did you like the Gear and weapons from the first game? Then you will love what Lara got new in stock in this one! Some are familiar and some are new but you learn it just as quickly as you did in the first game.

Although this new Lara isn't like the old Lara she is still a loveable and powerful Character that you will start liking very quickly. More Emotions are shown and she looks more human thanks to an actual face model. 

The Game has some great and fun Puzzles and also gives you the ability to explore alot more around thanks to a bunch of challenge tombs and side quests. 

I believe this is also the first Tomb Raider that actually offers a new game+ Option and I cant see what this is like, as you will notice very early that some areas you cant access unless you have enhanced tools from the previous save file. So it definitely has replayability. 

Although there was no Croft Manor like it usually is with Tomb Raider Games I did enjoy it very much and since the game is around 23 Hours Long I recommend getting it on Sale as 25€ seem to be a perfect price for that.

This Game is Vampire approved ✔️",True

"Very well made fast-paced FPS that allows you to spit out all of your accumulated daily salt into an anger-hatred fueled lean, mean, ripping and tearing killing machine.

Excellent dynamics if not for very rare cases of glitch and weird hit-boxes (once in my case)

I did not expect such a good storytelling and did not expect to end this way, very well presented even though it is a bit short.

Some secrets are too easy too find, others are... well I am still looking.

It can be so frustrating trying to sell some product only to have a modder randomly blow you up from across the map. One of the more common bugs I've noticed is infinite loading screens, which requires you to reload your game. The initial loading screen to get into the game can literally take between 5-10 minutes every time. But god damn, this is still a fun game despite all that.",True

"Occasionally I fall back on BFBC2 to play the great campaign. Here's my review. I don't write a lot, and there's not much chance this will reach the front, but to those who read this: [b] It's worth the 20$ (standalone price). [/b]

  Battlefield Bad Company 2 is the sequel to the original. I have not played the original, but from the campaign and the witty characters, I can tell the company has a strong bond (at least in this game). Battlefield Bad Company 2 has a great storyline to it, and develops the story line very interesting. It also balances out storyline with gameplay - meaning that you won't have 30-minute-long story cuts (exaggerations), but instead be able to be part of the action. For instance - you're sneaking on an enemy and your team intends on going about the job in a sneaky way. You have only your trust combat knife, and there's 1 enemy at the watchtower you need to take out to get the job clean. The story doesn't do it for you; you have to creep up (crouch) and sneakily assassinate him. After that, the story may resume. [b] The story, again, is very detailed and nicely planned. It is not something someone made up within a day - it is something made up within weeks, or even months. [/b] The only downside is that the campaign is really short. You can finish it within a couple hours, at most a day or two. Still, it's worth it.
  Since this is 20$ and it is 7 year of age (up to this review), the game has not been updated, but has been kept alive. There are about 20 or so multiplayer servers hosted in a multitude of countries that keep the multiplayer section still running, for when you finish that really quick campaign. 
  The game's way of playing is unlike anything else. It's like a regular schooter, but you will see that within the multiplayer, and a little bit of singleplayer, you will have to use other things. For example, there are 4 classes; Assault, Medic, Recon, and Engineer ([b] ***please note that in the single player you can change up primariers and secondaries and you do not have classes***[/b]). The Assault is a basic class; usual primary with an auto/burstfire rifle and a pocket pistol. The Recon is a somewhat complex class; you have a motion sensor ball that when thrown will recieve radio signals. If you're on the US side, and you hear english, there are teammates nearby. If you're on the US side, and you hear russian, there are enemies by [and you need to start poppin' some ruskis, no hate to my russians] and vice-versa. The Recon also has about 5 C4's. You can lay down C4 and with a right-click, they detonate. C4's are highlighted with detailed circles on your mini-map and while visible. What's fun is that you can attach C4's onto your car (in MP) and drive them into enemy tanks or just enemy territory, get out, and set off the C4's, making funny kills. Recon comes with a sniper rifle and pistol. The Medic class usually comes with a defibrillator and you can resurrect teammates. I have seen this, but in old servers - it may be removed in newer ones. Medic has a PKM usually (or any LMG) and, of course, a pistol. The Engineer is my favorite class. Usually, this class comes with a silenced machine-pistol (or SMG), and a regular pistol. The Engineer, in MP, has a rocket launcher (usually just the russian RPG), which will prove to be very helpful when blowing up enemy tanks and/or jeeps / ATVs.  The engineer class also comes with a power-drill that can heal vehicles, any vehicle (probably don't want to do it on your enemy's vehicle though) and can also kill. Yes, you can kill with a power drill, and yes, it's very funny. 
  In the end, this game is really amazing, even after years of being on the Steam shop. Its campaign may be short, but Multiplayer will definitely suit your needs. Multiplayer is also the most fun, depending on how you are. [b] In short, for $20 and with an age of 5+ years (at the time of this review 7 years), Battlefield: Bad Company 2 serves as a great game overall regardless of its short campaign, which it makes up for again with the multiplayer. I sincerely recommend this game for nostalgia, battlefield playstyle, and fun times with an FPS game. Consider the $20 worth it. [/b]",True

"This may be the weirdest game I have ever played, and this is coming from a fan of Hatoful Boyfriend. It's such a mix of well-done elements and absolute cluelessness that it makes for a bizarre and fascinating train wreck. I was compelled to play on so I could see just how bad it was. But save your time and money, I'm happy to share my findings.

Pros:
- Voice acting. It's not amazingly good, but it is an advantage that many visual novels/dating sims/eroge in English don't have.
- Cute art of the various characters. This game honestly may have the best art of any pretty-girl game on the app store. I even liked the images of the extremely odd-looking hidden character [spoiler redacted.]

Cons:
- It's racist. Really racist. You must buy stereotypical Mexican items like sombreros for the Latina, traditional Japanese items for the Japanese woman, and the Middle Eastern woman wears the kind of Arabian Nights harem outfit you'd find at a (racist) costume store. The Japanese woman will call you a ""!@#$ing racist"" for giving her this crap, but still accepts and appreciates these gifts somehow. At least the black woman gets airline memorabilia, that's something... :/ You never get a chance to ask any of these women what country they are actually from or whether they are an American. By the way, your fairy guide will describe these women in terms like ""brown sugar"" and ""yellow fever"". I guess it's supposed to be less racist because... it's meant as humor? She's a girl? I dunno.
- How to describe the Sisyphean despair that is the economy of HuniePop? You may only like one or two of the 9-12 women in the game. (I liked a grand total of two, it would've been three if the cute fairy weren't also a racist idiot.) But in order to buy your girlfriend presents, you must go on dates with other women, which earns you cash (""Munie"".) Besides, what else are you going to do? In the world of HuniePop, there is NOTHING BUT DATING AND SEX. No hobbies, no real conversations, no joy.
- Laughably outdated dating sim conventions: you buy the right present for the female to level up in romance. Getting a woman's last name or favorite color right will repeatedly level up your love skills. You stud, you.
- Mechanics that make no sense. Dates are successfully completed by getting a certain number of points. If you get two points shy from 17,000, even though she has been laughing and complimenting you the whole time, your date suddenly freaks out and often makes fun of you. Then you get money and can ask them out again and again! They never say no, unless they're hungry. Then you give them a bagel or something first.
- Match-3 bubble popping. So, so many bubbles. While ""date gifts"" can be used for various advantages, it's always the same mini-game.
- You must have all the sex to complete the game in any semi-meaningful way (you get a tiny cutscene with the nymphomaniac fairy saying ""Good job!"", an achievement, and access to the final game content.) Every single woman in the game, no exceptions. Don't want to sleep with a woman and her daughter? To constantly lie to different women about whether you're only seeing them, or to assure two that you agree with different stuff? Are you not attracted to a character who talks like a little girl, or the [redacted] with the ridiculous breasts and the weird-looking face? TOO BAD. Get with them or GTFO.
- And what is the sex? Is it at least sexy? NOPE! More bubble-popping! Match 'em for dear life, because unless you quickly and accurately attain the mysterious achievement that is the female orgasm via mini-game, not only will you not get a sexy graphic or any other reward, you are STUCK THERE FOREVER. You can't take a woman home, play the mini-game for an hour, fail, and say ""I'm not feeling it, honey."" There are also no save files, so, good luck with that, sucker!",False

What bother me is the challenge part is 3 times much harder than before.  I just can't do 100% completion because it really take too much time and effort also it raged me so hard at certain map (fvcking joker carnival man).

"Let's get the bad things out of the way first.

Cons:
- Terrible default controls

That's about everything I hated in this game, but after much strategizing and rebinding, which involved: 
- Moving the map scroll keys from the directional pad to WASD
- inventory to C, 
- map to TAB
- next char/prev char to Q and E respectively, 
- reveal interactable objects to V

And a whole bunch of other QoL improvements. The general idea is to completely remove my reliance from the other half of the keyboard, particularly the right side since I am right-handed and that's reserved to my mouse. Infinity Engine games needed this option like real bad. My settings are not intuitive for the casual gamer, but Diablo 3 taught me there were better ways to access my inventory besides going all the way to I. And Diablo 3 is pretty casual.

But once all these are set, and I got used to my own controls, I am able to immerse myself in the game completely. No more glancing on the keyboard, no more groping for the right key - my eyes are on the game 100%, enjoying the sheer narrative bliss, the engaging tactical combat, and the captivating story that keeps me at the edge of my seat.

This is a true successor to the infinity engine games. I would love to see Baldur's Gate on this engine, with its stunning visuals, pleasant to the eye yet evokes the imagination. This is the enigma that Bioware left behind instead of improving upon. While Dragon Age: Inquisition is a glorious adventure in its own right, my heart belongs to Eternity!

"Got this game on an awesome special so I don't have many greviences. It's a fun game when you are winning but fairly frustrating when you aren't, the reason this is, is not because the game is too hard but rather the game doesn't allow for much variety in strategies. You will restart over and over untill you find the one strategy that works. This makes it an unbalanced strategy game because you may as well watch a bot vs bot match on any RTS and pretend you are one of the bots. With that said, when you are winning it's quite enjoyable and would be a VERY decent game if this feeling was well maintained.

"[h1] An Unexpected, if Mixed Journey to the West[/h1]

(Full disclosure: I bought this game on impulse during a sale and had it sitting in my library for almost two years before I played it)

Inspired by one of the most well-known of the four great classics of Chinese literature, Journey to the West, Odyssey to the West plays fast and loose with much of its source material in interesting ways. As someone who isn't particularly interested in the source material, I wasn't terribly bothered by its deviations, though history geeks will have a field day ripping it a new one.

Odyssey to the West's shining achievement is its story and the relationship between Trip and Monkey. Trip herself is a gold mine of interesting character interpretations: [spoiler]is she just a teenager using whatever tools she can to survive in a world gone mad, even if it involves enslaving a man? Or does she seriously lack empathy and is willing to break promises for the sake of revenge? [/spoiler].

Monkey's no slouch either, being much more than just a muscular, snarking, angry anti-hero. The way they play off each other is fantastic, and with the exception of one scene near the end of the game, I was completely enthralled by how their relationship progressed. The authenticity of Monkey and Trip's relationship brings to mind the best partnerships in gaming, such as Joel and Ellie from The Last of Us, or Link and Midna from Twilight Princess. 

Unfortunately, there are no other ""real"" characters besides these two, which makes the game feel empty. The two named characters that are introduced besides them [spoiler], Pigsy and Pyramid, [/spoiler] fall flat due to the former's irritating mannerisms (with few redeeming moments, though they are meaningful) and the latter's lack of screentime. 

The war that tore the planet is barely talked about, reducing much of its significance since there's effectively zero information about the world before it was destroyed, or what destroyed it. The lack of audio logs, codexes, or other information-giving collectibles would have alleviated this, but the only collectibles are those used for upgrades, and masks, which are effectively meaningless [spoiler]until the end of the game.[/spoiler]

Though the game suffers from some loading glitches and framerate drops, the game is still gorgeous, with a richly detailed post-apocalyptic world that reminds me of, yet again, The Last of Us. Destroyed mechanical titans lay in scattered heaps on overgrown, damp city streets, and giant junkyards made of cobbled-together mechanical parts offer safe passage over dangerously oily water. The world is full of color and light. 

The animation work is excellent. While not yet crossing the uncanny valley, facial movements are accurate and impressive. Monkey's movements in particular are a sight to behold, as he dodges, clambers up ledges, and even holds himself in an accurately simian manner.

The music is surprisingly good, reminding me a bit of the Metroid Prime games in a good way, and the voice acting is impressive and nuanced.

Unfortunately, the gameplay is more of a mixed bag. While combat is satisfying, it quickly grows repetitive due to the very limited pools of moves available and the lack of enemy variety, since all enemies are just robots that fall into one of five categories and feature various states of rust or disuse. The ability to exploit flaws in your enemies' design is interestng, on the other hand (for example, ripping open a decayed power cell on a scout to turn him into a walking bomb), opening up opportunities to turn the tide in unexpected ways.

Boss fights are a letdown. While a few early ones are interesting, they gradually drop in quality due to overly large health bars, poorly-scripted phase changes, or the recycling of previous bosses.

Upgrading Monkey requires currency that can be found around the world or gathered from enemies, and while most don't drastically change your playstyle and are of varying usefullness, filling out Monkey's skill trees is still fun, if irritating due to how hard it is to find tech orbs after you've cleared a level.

The few vehicles sections handle well and don't overstay their welcome. Monkey has a [spoiler] Cloud (actually a disk, but you know what they were going for) [/spoiler] that he busts out for some bosses or watery areas, and it's a blast to rocket around on it.

Traversal feels remarkably similar to Infamous in all the best ways. Monkey can grapple, climb, jump, or swing from impressively high or complicated structures, and the movement itself can almost become an engaging sort of puzzle.

Speaking of puzzles, some of the environment-based ones are quite entertaining, though not on the level of a dedicated puzzle game. An encounter in a dilapidated opera house that requires you to manipulte props, scaffolding, and lighting is particularly interesting.

Unfortunately, the camera is your constant enemy, rapidly changing orientation when you round a corner or failing to indicate where to go next when grappling around. In combat, it can often fail to properly display where enemies are, and its sluggish movement makes the (thankfully rare) shooting sections incredibly frustrating.

While I won't detail specifics, the final level tries too hard to wrap up loose ends and feels anticlimactic in comparison to previous stages. The ending in particular is sudden and confusing, attempting to introduce elements minutes before the credits roll.

ENSLAVED: Odyssey to the West is not a bad game. The story, characters (all two of them), sound and visuals are almost universally excellent, and some of the combat, puzzles and exploration can be fun. However, the overall lack of variety or depth in the combat, letdowns in terms of the story, and some truly terrible camera angles, shooting sections, and boss fights keep this back from achieving true greatness in all respects.

Also, seriously, Trip, please put more clothes on.

[list] Pros:
[*] Trip and Monkey's relationship is the highlight of the game
[*] Excellent music and voice acting
[*] Colorful, interesting world design and characters
[*] Upgrade system is satisfying
[*] Puzzles and movement are engaging
[*] Vehicle sections don't take too long
[/list]
[list] Cons:
[*] Repetitive, shallow combat
[*] The god-damn camera
[*] No interesting characters besides Trip and Monkey, or really any, for that matter
[*] Visual bugs and framerate drops
[*] The goddamn camera
[*] Shooting sections are frustrating because of the godDAMN camera
[*] Boss fights are lackluster
[*] Ending leaves much to be desired
[*] The GODAMN CAMERA

"I really enjoy this for a ""quick"" strategy game.  Inverted commas because I rarely manage to stop after one game.

In a very broad sense it's a bit like chess, in that you have to make sure you're not moving a piece into trouble.  However, since all pieces can move every turn, you need to pay a bit more attention - could an enemy unit you're relying on for cover move out of the way?  I've certainly been carless and killed the unit myself with another piece.  One thing I needed to learn from experience was the order in which enemy units move, which can make a big difference here.

I certainly make a lot of mistakes, losing units unnecessarily and then desperately trying to clear the floor with what I have left, but I enjoy that too.  It's especially satisfying when you accidentally move a unit to what looks like certain death, and are able to use your other units to save it.  Great game!",True

"Creeper World 3 is a very innovative and original real time strategy game where you fight a mass of liquid known as the creeper.

"This is my favourite game of ALL TIME. So I know the game inside out and so can pick out a few things that are definitely different and not in a good way. Firstly with the intro sequence showing the background to the story, the audio is all out of sync. Secondly, as soon as you get into the game at Rainbow Cliffs the game runs EXTREMELY slowly, this seems to happen throughout the game so far (I've played through 2up, Ship Rex and Walk in the Park) but mostly in Rainbow Cliffs. It's not too much of a problem in the other levels however in Rainbow Cliffs when I first opened the game I almost concluded the game was unplayable. It seems to be certain areas in the other levels that trigger it to run slowly for instance, in 2up it runs slowly until you reach the first two of Cass' henchmen at the waterfall and then runs fine after that area. Another problem I encountered was the camera. If you're near a wall it will tend to ""freak out"" and you can't see at all what you're doing and trying to move the camera to a place where you can see is near impossible. The only way to fix it is to move TY himself away from the area that is causing the camera to stop working. Another small problem which I'm only picking up on because I love the game is that when you collect a thunder egg/golden cogg/bilby the music in the background continues to play over the tune that plays when you collect it. The audio in ""Walk in the Park"" is also not too great as sometimes the sound of the rain/waterfalls can be too loud to hear what any of the characters are saying. 

The quality of the models and environment are beautiful and is a definite improvement from the xbox/playstation games. The controls work for the PC very well. However, I realise this is an early access to the game, I really hope that the speed that the game runs at can be fixed as it is the biggest problem and really impacts the gameplay so far.",True

"This is the best ping pong game(except the real one) I've ever play! Highly recommand!

After the main description at the first line which I know most of you guys may only read, I'll comment some details.

This game do have the convincing experience makes me truely think i'm playing the real ping pong. But here's some suggestion for you the dear developers :

First, no spin ball, no spin ball, no spin ball. In ping pong games, spin is not only make ball tto change the moving path and speed, it make lots of attacking movementt possible, like the fast attack top spin. As a trained semi-pro ping pong player, I feel that with out top spin, most of the right powerful loop will be impossible in this game. With out topspin, the right loop will be too slow to go through the net or to high to catch the table. Chop is the most impotant defend weapon for tennis grip, while loop is the most impotant counter-attack weapon. Abandon the spin makes tennis grip impossible to play, which is the most comfortable grip way for using HTC Controllor;


Second, no let in the game. Which means no reserve for the net serve.

Third, I know it is almost impossible to make the mass touch feeling for smash on Vive. But after fix the spin ball, can we have the custom paddle? In this systerm, we can custom the out look, most impotantly the rubber. Different rubber has different effect on spin, the stroke speed and so on. That will make this game amazing.

Fourth, social network play and multiplay mode.


This is my first comment on steam.I'm always too lazy to reply my experience. But for this promising game, I just so love it and tribute my first time.LOL


好了，该来一发中文了。这游戏强力推荐，我玩过最好的乒乓游戏，完美模拟了乒乓球的物理轨迹和触感。

但最大的毛病是，没有旋球。上旋下旋侧旋拆球都没有。这让拿横板的情何以堪。拉不了球削不了球，神烦- -

但是直板要是不旋的话，触感还是非常感人非常棒的，适应时间非常短就能很轻松的像真乒乓一样控制球路。

游戏还是早期版本，有些缺失也能谅解。接下来的版本除了旋球外，希望还能加入社交和网络对战，自定义球拍胶面等。到时候这游戏一定屌翻天。

"I would have recommended this game, until this update on Jan 5. I don't know who was smoking what with this stat nerf, but they need to fix this. Goodbye Ark, at least until someone realizes how stupid of an idea this was.

This is so long I had to add it to the review and not in the comment section, but it does include some specifics as to why I gave a negative review.

To Bigmac; first off, nothing I said was anything but an opinion, so it by definition can't be false. Second, it's not hateful, nowhere did I add anything into the review that indicates any form of hate, just that I disagree with this particular update and that I would no longer recommend this game. Now, let me explain why I disagree with this stat nerf, and why I think implementing it was stupid. I love the game as a whole, but I strongly disagree with the methodology the devs are using to balance the games mechanics. This is a development game, true, but it is also a development game that people have paid for and have put 100's of hours into. People have gone to great lengths to build what they have and tame what they have and this patch ruined much of that. For example, I have a high lvl scorpion that I had tamed to knock certain things out. I had its damage at about 800%. Scorpions do 3x torpor to their damage over a 10 second period. Their base damage is 15. Now, it had very low damage when tamed, even though it was high lvl. That wasn't a problem at all, until this patch. It used to be a 10% gain on damage per lvl, so since I started out at 200% damage, I gained it at 20% per lvl. That's slow, but I only needed it to reach a certain point. Now, because it had low base damage, it has roughly 240% damage. I can't get those lvls back and even if I could what was once a useful creature would be worthless no matter what I do with it. This was a 120 scorpion. Now, scorpions are easy to tame so finding another one with better stats wouldn't be a huge problem, but there is nothing I could do to get one powerful enough to do anything close to what I wanted it for. That isn't my only useless creature now, it was just my hardest hit one, and it lets me easily explain the problem I have with the way they did the nerf. By nerfing the per lvl stats so much they made any and all choices made on certain creatures lvl's worthless and they limited the kind of customization allowed per creature. Your points now matter less, there is less progress to be had. I dislike any changes that limit what kind of builds or the degree to which your decisions matter. A better route would have been limited the max gain per lvl per stat, or dimishing returns with some possible base stat adjustments in either scenario. Even better yet they could, and should, and adjusted wild dino stats up rather than take tamed ones down. Many people within their playerbase feels, rightly, betrayed by this change which so adversly affected their hard work. This game is still in development, but since they have opened it to the public and since the public has largely funded it's progress and has largely affected the design of the game, they should be a little bit consious of how their actions affect the playerbase. I would not have been so short and harsh with my review had there been a ""hey, we're nerfing stats, this is what we plan to do"" post a week ahead, or if they had bothered to give players a chance to reset their creatures stats to accomodate the kind of change, or if they had considered any of the specific scenarios accompanying the update at all. Very clearly they had a vision for the game, overshot what they intended the balance to be by not analyzing their own mechanics properly, and then decided to bring it back and start from scratch on what their intended path was completly lacking any perspective on their playerbase. And to make that entire plan worse they didn't properly analyze the changes from this patch either. Why do I say that? Gathering rates, specific balance problems, etc. These are things that should have been included in the base patch. Not 3 or 4 patches after. There is still no method for alleviating many of the problems, which shows that the patch was poorly thought out and rushed, aka, stupid. I dislike any game devs who show a lack of regard to their playerbase. Last group I saw that did this was Bioware (admittedly this was probably more of EA's fault) with SWTOR. They didn't at all consider the fans of their series. And that is the same mistake that the devs of Ark are making. There are thousands of people who love this game, myself included, but I refuse to play a game with devs who put so little forethought into what they put of particularly as it applies to their players. If they fix it, I'm back and a fan for life, provided they learn from this mistake. I'm not a ""3 strikes your out"" kind of person; they fix this I'm back. They make one more mistake of this kind and I'm gone for good.",False

"Some parts of this game are very fun but its simple stuff in this game that they failed on such as the entire finding fragments to be able to make an item. I can understand why it would take some time to find fragments for the cyclops but basic ones that players are supposed to have right away such as the battery charger and the modification station are impossible i've spent over 24 hours looking for them and still nothing. I cant even use the basic seaglide anymore cause the battery only lasts 5 mins and it grew beyond ridiculous making new batteries each time. The way I see it they can do either three things first of include the battery charger plans already when you start a new game I mean its probably the second most needed thing in the game why is it so hard to find you can't really play the game without it. Secondly make the spawn for the fragments for items like that and the modification station way more common or thirdly get rid of the fragments plans all together. Until they fix this I won't be putting much hours into this game at all it's just to frustrating.

Secondly one of the best parts of the game before was the fact that you could stack tanks for more oxygen why would they take that away and put in a tank that gives you very little oxygen. The entire game consists of 10 seconds to swim down about 10 to 15 for exploring then you need. The only way to really explore is to use a vehicle that is run by you guessed it batteries which of course you'll need the hard to find charger for unless you dont mind running back to your base every 5 minutes to make a new one. You can upgrade your tank ur overall it still barely adds any air whatsoever.

The last thing is even though the creatures in this game are kinda scary looking theirs not that big creature like a kraken or anything that really makes you freak out. I mean the scariest and biggest creature in the game appears to be a mushroom like stingray that is a friendly.

Overall i would say the game isn;t worth the price i paid for it unless they make some serious changes overall like the ones I would recommend. It's biggest quality is the graphics and the beautiful textures but other than that at the end of the day It leaves alot to be desired.",False

While the game starts of easy enough towards the end it begins to ramp up the difficulty quite a bit, although experienced gamers probably still won't find a huge amount of challenge.

The games main drawback is that sometimes it is difficult to find out why you failed a jump as for all intents and purposes it seems like you timed everything correctly.

The only other negative in the game is the voice acting, although the acting itself is good the actors mispeak some of their lines which can break immersion slightly.

    [*]lack of an actual endgame. Tempered monsters and jewel farming isn't as fun as hunting Deviants on MHGU or Apex and lv 140 monsters in MH4U, it's also very repetitive, since,outside tempered monsters, the only monsters worth hunting are elder dragons
    [*]ARCH TEMPERED MONSTER. Most of them aren't fun [spoiler] ( cough...Lunastra) [/spoiler] and only have more Hp, offensive power and, in some cases, cheap tactics. Sometimes they get some new moves.[spoiler] the only one that's  "" different ""  from the others is Xeno'Jiiva [/spoiler]

"A short, creepy, puzzle platformer with some really interesting creatures and presentation.  It's dark atmosphere is the star and reminds me a bit of games like Inside with the really weird world in which you don't know what is going on or where you fit into it.  The puzzles aren't of the same quality though with them focusing more on avoiding danger through positioning and stealth or just finding a path through an area.  There really are no hard, brain-bending puzzles but that isn't what it was going for.

Really the only negatives are the shortness vs price and the controls being a bit non-standard and awkward for my tastes.  I was playing with mouse and keyboard though, so perhaps a controller feels a bit better.  I suppose a more definitive ending would have also been appreciated, but it was cool none the less.

"Good:

Fun.  A good mix of things I recognize mixed with new material.  I enjoyed it once I got used to it (see bad).

Just the right amount of challenge.  It takes a bit of getting used to, but once I figured out how it works it was all smooth sailing and I completed the game quickly (including black armor).

Really cool armor effects.  Different combinations of armors and weapons give different results, with tons of variety.

Lots of secrets to find.  This game has great replay value if you want to see everything.  Plenty of ""ah ha"" moments as I figure things out.

Bad:

Noticeable input lag.  Yes, set game resolution to my monitors native resolution, no prerendered frames or vsync, etc.  I play tons of twitchy games under the same setup and this one lags.  If you're the type of person who notices it, this game will take some adjusting to.

Armor/weapon combos are not very well balanced.  Some are nearly useless, some completely overpowered to the point of trivializing the game.

Some touchy platforms. For example the turning wheel platforms on stage 2, sometimes I jump on the platforms and all is well, sometimes I pass right through the exact same platform that worked last time.

Conclusion:

This game has some rough edges but lots of style and fun gameplay.  It's worth the asking price and I don't regret this one.  I'll follow this developer and see if their future releases improve on it.",True

"This game, while riddled with bugs currently, is a great game all around.

Personally, I find the PVP a bit lacking, but that's not the main attraction of this game. The Co-op modes, including Slaughter, Survival, and Conquest, are what makes this game such a gem. 

My biggest complaint about this game is the lack of introduction on the classes, as many of the useful tools equipped on characters can be easily overlooked if people don't look into the game. 

Anyways, the game is worth it. In game purchases are only for cosmetic items, everything else is just getting credits mid-game.

"Can't recommend this. It might be one of the worst shooters I've ever played in terms of the way in-game guns work. The weapon spread in this game is absolutely ridiculous even tapping the trigger or burst firing (which is the only way I play). 

The major thing to note is that spread doesn't reduce immediately after firing, you need to WAIT for your spread to return to normal if you do a ""long"" burst, which would be 4-5 shots in this game. So stopping when firing doesn't mean your spread will be normal the next time you fire, which is idiotic in my opinion because I freaking hate unrealistic spread in FPS games. I mean basically it comes down to luck if 2 people see each other, its whoever gets the luckier spread basically wins the firefight, which I simply can't acknowledge as good gameplay. It's not, especially in a shooter.

The other thing is the hitreg in this game seems hit or miss 50% of the time, either that or the spread is so bad on some of these guns that it makes the hitreg seem broken. You can literally stand 15 feet from someone and spray them while controlling the recoil and hit abolutely nothing other than your first 2 shots, which is absolutely idiotic if your crosshair is directly dead center on whatever you happen to be shooting at. It's just plain bad because your bullets do not go where your crosshair is even if you are dead center on the guy, its the most idiotic thing I've ever seen.

I mean, I've had headshots on people when the crosshair was nowhere near their head. I've shot people in the leg, and somehow magically got a headshot, that's how insane and bad this games spread is, it has nothing to do with recoil, the spread on these guns is just simply idiotic. 

Most of the time when I see someone when coming from around a corner and clearly get a headshot on them first, nothing happens, and instead I instantly die somehow, probably because your gun has increased spread when you're running around, which makes it again come down to 100% luck to whoever wins in close engagements when moving. Doesn't matter who pulls the trigger first or who's crosshair is more accurate if you run into somebody, it all comes down to who is luckier with their weapon spread at the time, I simply cannot agree with this as being skill-based or good gameplay. 

Cheaters and lag are also two big issues in this game.

The other thing, footsteps are way too loud in this game, making it a true campers wet dream. I don't have a problem with this, it just makes the game way too boring most of the time especially on these linear maps. Almost ALL of the maps have single choke points which results in only 1 entrance, which makes snipers insanely overpowered, especially when ALL the guns have completely idiotic spread.

The game doesn't even reward you fairly for doing well either, the rewards at the end of matches (weapon skins) are given out completely randomly from what I've seen.

This is the only FPS on the planet where you actually have to test how bad the spread is against a wall to understand how to use the weapon in the most effective way possible. The weapon mechanics in this game are less about skill and more about luck in my opinion, especially at close/medium range fights, all it comes down to who has the most luck with spread. I simply cannot recommend this game to anyone even if its on sale for 5 dollars, I do not agree with these game mechanics at all. You're much better off buying BF4, I do not recommend CoD, that franchise died with MW2, and from what people tell me cheaters literally control CoD-ghost MP.",False
"**Pros**
- Plenty of thematic content to explore.
- Many DLCs (which go on sale often) that  bring new ways to play and a provide an intricate look into the ""lore"" of Stellaris.
- Easy to play with friends (hot join system) and simple server hosting. Multiplayer games can be saved/loaded and you can switch the empire you play as when you rejoin.
- High customization that allows for loads of creativity.
- Many levels of difficulty, as well as a ""scaling difficulty' setting that scales the difficulty of your game as you progress. 

**Cons**
- Learning curve as a new player is somewhat steep (based on personal experiences with friends). The first few games for my friends were very confusing and frustrating. After a day or two, however, we were all able to play well through the mid-game with relative ease.
- User interface could be more compact and looks a bit outdated. There are many mods (mainly for single player games) that upgrade the HUD, but not many for multiplayer servers. 
- When playing alone or with just another friend, smaller-medium sized galaxies can feel massive or cluttered depending on how you tweak your settings, Be careful when selecting the amount of stars in the system, advanced AI starts (empires that start with some infrastructure/naval power already in place), and number of empires (I like to do 6-10, anything above 10-12 starts to feel too busy for me). 

Personally, I picked this game up really fast as I'm a fan of colony sims (ONI, Planetbase) and found that the many, many parts that make up the game are perfect for people who enjoy micromanagement games :). 8.5/10, because I feel that the game is thematically and strategically captivating--yet lacks the presentation/interface to help users (especially new ones) learn exactly what everything does and how to grow their skillset quickly (slow learning curve).",True

"Damn good game. Controls, storage, UI and world all make a consistent kinda sense. Killing a triceratops with a modded 9mm while fleeing a t-rex makes for hilarious nonsense. Island 359 is a great emergent quasi-narrative fps with obligatory wave modes and a fascinating progression through the story and upgrade paths.

Some of the graphics in Island 359 make my Super 2070 super-spinny even with low textures and draw distance; otherwise the beasts, NPCs, and virtual steel are all cohesive, attractive, and immersive. The only flaw I'll reddit here is the absence of a shotgun or super shotgun - all the weapons boom correctly while slaying a raptor with a bowie knife feels the right kind of wrong.

I give this game a solid 10/10.",True
"A visually stunning but very flawed remake of the original Half-Life. To their credit, the Black Mesa team has been working on this for a while and now that it's finally done it is a solid effort that has too many glaring flaws to recommend. 

The Good:

Level design for the first 2/3rds of the game is very good. Faithful recreations of Half-Life's most memorable levels gives a great nostalgia feeling and their creative liberties to adding additional details is phenomenal. The Black Mesa facility has never looked so good or felt so alive. Puzzles were faithfully recreated and in some cases expanded upon with more modern mechanics and graphics, enemies were smarter and more challenging than in HL, and drawing upon what we now know from gales like HL2 to expand upon the lore (Vortigaunts have obvious shackles on, for example) is great.

The Bad:

Guns need reworking - why can I fire the magnum while reloading? Why does the shotgun miss point blank when I shoot at Houndeye? Why does the shotgun have a delayed fire while reloading? 

Odd Level Geometry Hitboxes - I would find myself shooting around a corner only for an invisible wall that stuck out inches from the wall stopping my bullets, and especially in Xen with its oddly shaped geometry. 

Physics need work - items floating down from heights as if they weighed the same as a feather, bodies don't interact when you hit them with the crowbar (no gibs??), sometimes things I was standing on top of would freak out and hit me for massive physics damage, the cart in one level always gave off the sound of wood impacting metal. This was completely immersion breaking for me, and questionable as one of Source's strong points is the physics engine. 

Movement - I found myself getting frustrated a lot with how the game registered movement, especially jumps and double jumps. I would be moving forward towards the edge of an object and I would jump only...I wouldn't and I'd fall straight off the object/geometry I was on instead. Double jump was especially frustrating in this regard. Sometimes as well I would be running forward, I would hit a piece of rogue level geometry a slit second before jumping, sending me in the completely wrong direction. 

Brightness - The game is very dark. I suppose a lot of this is due to the use of the Source engine vs GoldSRC but I had to have the flashlight turned on almost 100% of the time to see anything. Without adjusting to look washed out it never got any better.

Xen - This is going to be long. Xen is visually appealing and amazing to explore. They did a great job reimagining the look and feel and adding to it with lore we got from HL2 and its episodes. However, the enemy placement could be frustrating, there was always a feeling (especially in late Xen) that there was never enough ammo, the level geometry as stated above was wild and unpredictable for shooting around or running/jumping on, and perhaps worst of all, it felt MUCH too long. I found myself quitting the game multiple times because levels like Interloper and Gonarch's Lair just kept dragging on and on. A lot of the puzzles felt unintuitive, and they got boring after a while with the same mechanics being used over and over again. 

Crashes and bugs - I can't begin to count the number of times the game crashed to desktop for me during play, during loading a new map, during extreme physics moments, and more. 

I played through it and completed it, but I just cannot recommend it to people over the original even though it looks great. I think if they continue to polish it and maybe find a way to make Xen more fun so it's length and tediousness is less apparent I would change my answer.",False

"I watched the anime around 2 years ago so I had a vague idea of the events of Steins;Gate

Though with the release of the Steins;Gate 0 anime and my desire to delve into the world of visual novels I decided to start with the original and eventually get around to playing Steins;Gate 0

I was honestly quite skeptical at first about playing Steins;Gate but once I pressed 'new game,' I felt like I was experiencing this series again for the first time. I'd realised how much I'd forgotten and how much I loved the character interactions and the plot. I've played a fair few games on Steam and sunk many more hours into them than Steins;Gate, though none of them had such a huge impact on me as this game did.

In short, (TL;DR?) if there's anyone here that's watched the anime and is interested in playing the visual novel but is hesitant to do so I would highly recommend you buy this game ASAP

Or, you play momentarily, then we will shut your game down and those 3 or 4 missions that you just took part in over a few hours...yeah, go ahead and forget about that. Do them again. They're fun anyway, right? In other words, don't buy this game unless you really like to continually play missions over and over again, not because you wanted to, but because Uplay stops and the game shuts down, and when you load back up (hoping that it will be at the last spot you were before it did) there you are...right where you started before you decided to play the game. Extremely inappropriate and should be fixed. Oh, Uplay just updated? Maybe the game will run properly now...oh...no...it still doesn't. Go figure.

"One of the biggest disappointments I had on Steam.
Looks really good graphically, the ""cute"" but creepy and dark graphic style works really well, and I was excited to play it with the controller on my TV, but straight away I hit the wall of poor game design.
Controls are terrible, in terms of what the character is able to do, the menues and how to interact and basically everything is bad, useless and unintuitive. It's boring and frustrating to play this game, most of the time you can't kill the enemies, and to loot you need to turn on a flashlight but this attracts the zombies, so what's the point of walking around not being able to do anything? Dying all the time is definitely not fun.
The crafting system is the worst I've ever seen, you just pick up random things all the time and a notification pops up when you can craft something, which you do pressing a button. Lame.
There's some serious bad game design all over it, if I can even call this ""game design"".

"16/8/2018: Not Recommended.
- This game runs ~60FPS on a 1060 6GB, 16GB RAM, i7-7700HQ, with all low...this sucks
- Network is bad. For me, I constantly have to check my network in every online  game, so I know that this could (potentially) be smooth while playing MH:W. Instead, the game rarely connects me to any open session, dumps me into offline while I want to have some fun helping strangers to beat Anjanath, or in the middle of the fight with Rathian... Not that I mind, but the entire network system could have been better.",False

"“The Painted Tower” (actually the first part in the “Drawn” series) is a lovely puzzle-adventure with a grimdark fairy-tale feel. It takes place inside a cursed tower, with paintings that lead to other worlds, and your goal is to get to the very top and save the princess (who has a unique talent to create living things from drawings) from an evil king. Graphics are well made, and the music is good to listen to; voice acting is few but technically well done. Puzzles are not too difficult, so even the beginners should have no trouble with them. Gameplay is relatively short, but at least with diverse achievements there is some replayability. Overall a good adventure which I can recommend.",True

"TL:DR: This game is years ahead of DayZ in every single way, if you hate DayZ, you will love this game.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This game flew under the radar and was underrated, considering the croc of shit this genra is, its worth looking into this game.
Lets just say, when compaired to DayZ its obvious this game is multiple YEARs ahead in development.
The game has working crafting(gear, bases, weapons, ect)/cars(multiples types, even troop carriers) camping, hunting, and resource gathering. 
Thirst, hunger, and illness all work.

The world is huge, immersive and beautiful. The detail, lighting and shading will make you say ""wow, this is early access?"".
 The games night cycle makes you loot franticaly with your flashlight, but dont use it to much or you will get seen. You can barely see anything at night without it, so be ready.
The zombies dont clip through crap, and actually behave properly. Albeit, there is not a ton of them at the time.

That being said, there are just a few issues I would want to address.  One:  The locked items thing.  Some items are locked in place, and you can't get rid of them even with cheats.  Nope.  That has to go.  Two:  The lack of help you get when you first begin playing.  Yes, there are control hints to help with placing stuff..  And a couple tutorial's on YouTube, but none ingame, which is stupid.  I don't want to stop my game to watch a tutorial for my game..  Things are just not explained accurately, its very much learn as you go.  Three:  The lack of modes..  There is Career, but not very many.  I really hope they add more in the future, like with DLC there could be more themed Career Modes unlocked.  The stupidest thing is there is a Challenge Mode, which is fine, but its essentially Hardmode Sandbox.   Also, of course there is a Sandbox mode as well.

it good,True
"A truly underrated title. It has a really great conversation system, interesting characters, and excellent leveling up and customization, allowing you to go through the game with different builds.

It is not, however, without its flaws. The gameplay controls are not very responsive. For a game looks and feels like it should be a third person shooter, the actual shooting mechanic is very poor. The stealth mechanics are better than the shooting, but Splinter Cell this is not. And it a few mandatory boss fights, which are of course terrible in this style of game. 

In fact, the game is very similar to Deus Ex: Human Revolution. They certainly both occupy the same genre of Steath/Action/RPG. The biggest difference is that DXHR has better gameplay, but far worse plot and character. Alpha Protocol has much better characters, plot, and dialogue/choices, but the gameplay is less polished. 


That said, if you enjoy games with well written characters, interesting choices, and one of the best conversation systems ever in any RPG, then you'll enjoy Alpha Protocol.",True

Subsistence is a amazing game it is in fact not like other games reguardless of what people say. It has it's own way of going about things. The fact that there is AI that builds and hunts after you get going is amazing. Most people say BS about this game but those are the people who dont understand the concept of EARLY ACCESS this game is still in develpoment and already is very good yes of course there is things that need to be fixed and this game needs the support of people to grow better then it already is. The dev is very active and listen to the community about things that need to be fixed and what they want to see. Everyone should give this game a chance it has shown more improvment then most Early Access games out there. And believe me i know ive bought a lot of early access games and found alot of shit ones. But this one is worth every dime and is a lot of fun. I wont lie yes its a pain in the ass to get started and what not but once you do it's lots of fun. So give the game a try you will not be dissapointed if you are give it time the game is in fact Early Access and needs work but as it is now its alot better then most and is playable unlike this other BS thats out there. Do not buy the game if you are just gonna whine about all the shit thats broken its early access its a time to support the dev and give them feedback to fix the problem instead of saying screw this game it sucks and asking for a refund and ruining it for people who will actually love this game like i do and many of my friends who played it have .

"This game has basically three ways of playing. Single player campaign, multi player campaign and just online battles. 

The main content is definitely campaign, but there is an existing pvp battle community. If you are just in it for that, it might be worth it. Otherwise it is not.

The campaign is awfully paced - basically no one finishes a campaign - and the AI is brain dead. 

Playing a multi player campaign might help to combat that. Or it would maybe, if the MP campaign would have any kind of support. Basic features that exist in the single player campaign, like battle difficulty and chaos invasion sliders are missing and in some campaigns it might end with random desyncs and host disconnects. It's a mess. 

I cannot recommend this game in the  current state it is in and I doubt they will ever fix these issues. The single player campaign plays out on a dead campaign map and drags on for way longer than necessary, is only a challenge to to the AI cheating an insane amount and is plagued with bugs after every update. The multi player campaign is unsupported and in an even worse state all the time, plagued further by the worst netcode imaginable.",False

"I find Victory at Sea a fun game for anyone who likes strategy.  The campaign begins quite challenging, because you only have one destroyer and you have to be careful.  Discretion is the better part of valor in the early stage of the game, at least until you have a small flotilla of warships.  There are three maps to play on:  Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Pacific.  Each map has historic factions to choose from.  The campaigns are fun and the random missions received at ports add some flexibility to the game-play.

However, there are a couple things I must address:

First, the visual aspect of the game is very disappointing.  The models look like they were made by an amateur with no 3D modeling experience.

Second, there are some annoying bugs that I hope will be fixed.  When a mission tasks the player with hunting an enemy ship or convoy, half of the time said convoy is very far away and is impossible to engage, and these missions end in default failure.  Another annoying bug is the fact that upon entering port there is a moment of “loading.”  This loading goes far too long, especially on a high-end system.  One might wonder why a game with such low visuals would need to load for so long.

I have enjoyed playing Victory at Sea.  I have beaten the Atlantic Campaign as the Royal Navy, and am working on it again as the Kriegsmarine.  I would recommend others to play this game, but it is my hope that the two issues I have previously addressed will be looked into.

"This is an inbalanced piece of garbage with an unnecessarily forced iron man mode, ridiculous mission structures where the AI gets to start immediately adjacent to your warband on some missions, the programmers have admitted they couldn't write good AI so they 'fixed' this by making the AI have more health, this often prevents winning fair fights because the AI always need more hits than you, also they seem to more often than not start with larger crews than you and placed in positions of tactical advantage. the devs have had years to fix this game but haven't bothered and also haven't allowed for mod support so a worst of both worlds, I'm sure they will do an awful job of Necromunda as well.  The RNG combined with the AI getting more health is ridiculous. The arbitrary deadlines for generating income - and random missions even with scouting upgrades often only showing BRUTAL as the easiest when you have 8 days to go, so you click next day and hope, still all brutal or worse, and the next.

Pros
====
The Total War formula for battles still seems to exist in this game.

Cons
=====
Combat:

The AI sucks at fighting


Strategic map:

Army movement is ludicrous, can't move more than a few inches without having to stop marching for 1/4 of a year.

Minor settlements are valuable but there's practically no way to defend them with the pitiful amount of troops you are allowed to field, this makes using strategy on the strategic map a useless gesture. 

Diplomacy doesn't function properly, every turn someone I am allied to starts a war or is declared war upon excepting the initial turn of the game. 

Factions seem to surrender to others for no reason, I was helping an ally who had an army of 10 with my army of 12 units against an enemy group of 20 advancing on him. Before our armies could start a battle, my ally immediately surrendered to Orkney, leaving me to fight a war against 3 different factions by myself.

Creating ""armies"" of one general to zerg all enemy bases except the main castle seems like a ridiculously effective strategy since you can recruit your entire army later to support them without having to worry about supply lines or the willingess of the local people to fight... they just beam in at low levels of troops to reinforce to full in around 5-7 turns.

"This game is weird. It sells itself as a horror visual novel, but so much of it deals with financial and relationship problems. Every now and then(usually at the end of the chapter) a spooky ghost will show up but that's after you spent God knows how much time reading about a real estate agent struggle with money and her overseas family, or a socialite fighting with her husband while trying to redecorate her new house. 

It's not terrible, because the writing is good and the art is great, but it's not what I was expecting at all. So do I recommend this game? Yes, just make sure what you're getting into, if you want a horror game that's gonna scare your to death, this isn't it. It's more like a drama with horror elements, there's some scary parts for sure, but they don't seem to be the focus of the game.",True

"Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.

Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.

For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.

Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.

Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crou
ching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.

Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.

If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.
Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.",True

"Guggl Butts is my favorite game I love the balance between the story and action. However that one time when the killer popcorn machine jumped out of the boat really scared me and I almost punched my Guggle Buddy right in the face. Oh! Thats right I forgot to mention how much fun the Guggle Buddy system is although it does have its Quarks and the way it almost breaks the laws of physics really bothered me I still can't understand how the game manages to create an exact copy of me every time I turn it on I mean really where does the matter come from?!?! Also why is it that clone me can only press the F5 key and scream at me Dutch? I do not find it helpful in the least, but it does add to the immersive feel of the game expecially when I had to throw the freeze dried Golden Trout at Cornelis Tromp during the Scanian War in the 72'nd act of chapter 4 (Battle of Lund) . Overall great game and I would recomend it to all of my friends. 10/10 would fight with the Swedish army again!!!!",False
"Thumper is a decent to poor rythm game, but has many frustrating elements which lead to it becoming very borig. Vissually, it looks great, especially in VR.

While the game is a rythm game, I never feel like I can get into the rythm like I can with most rythm games. I need to constantly  use my eyes to figure out what is coming next, with the rythm providing only a tiny hint of timing.  Even still, the game often repeats the same subsequence in the game several times, so you can learn it that way. But I never felt really into the music, and the music generally isn't that pleasent, I can hardly call it music at all.

But certain actions are much more difficult then they should be, specifically pounding. A few bosses require the pound move to complete, but I could only get the pound move to work around a third of the time. When a boss required several pounds to be performed in a row, I ended up repeating that section several times (for at least 10 minutes) before being able to progress. At that point, the boss became boring. He could not hurt me because his attacks were trivially easy to dodge, and I could not hurt him because I could not pound consistently.

Visually, the game is quite breathtaking, but you can't really stop to enjoy it. If your looking for a game that gets you into the zone in VR, this might be what your looking for, but the near random nature of the music keeps you from really honing in on the rythm.",False
"Honestly, sleeping dogs is a wonderful game overall, but this edition is almost universally seen as the ""Definitively Worse™"" edition.

To top it all off, they ruined the customization in this game, too. You can't mix and match DLC costume parts anymore; they force you to pick the preset or nothing.

"I first got introduced to Terraria around December of 2013, and I absolutely loved it! I played it whenever I could on my friends kindle, until I got a phone to play it on. A few years later I found out about steam and one of the first games I purchased was Terraria. You can find yourself spending hours in this game mining for resources to upgrade your weapons to take out a boss, and then mabye find a floating island or explore the ocean or make a mob farm etc. There are really so many things to do in this game.

eventually the game can get kind of boring after playing it for along time, and once you have played through the game a few times it can get repetitive. 

If you get tired of singleplayer I strongly recommed to get your firends to play with you Its allot more fun when your playing together with other people. Another thing you could do is download some mods, I promise you that you will have loads of fun with mods, there are so many amazing mods out there to play with, and some of them will completely change your Terraria experience for the better.

Another great thing about the game is the soundtrack, the soundtrack is awesome, its probably one of my favorite soundtracks for a game.

something I would really like them to do is update it more often, but I understand that its not that easy. 

Anyway I would definitely recommed this game to anyone, its a great and you can have lots of fun with it.

"Much like the previous game, emphasis on the same aspects in that it's very clear what the game is trying to do. 
You play ruler of a tropican island and it's your job to have the island prosper and grow while juggling your relations with the big superpowers as well as your own growing population.

The game is now built around 4 time periods or Eras; Colonial, World Wars, Cold War and Modern Times. Special events happen all the time throughout the game, depending on which Era you are in. This brings a lot of variety to the game and is a nice addition from Tropico 4.

Multiplayer has been added to the game, which is exciting - I haven't played it much but it seems decent enough. Nothing really worth invisting too much time into - If you are thinking about buying the game, buy it for the Single Player modes

The music is excellent and probably the only thing about the game done to perfection. It's mostly instrumental music unlike Tropico 4 and i have to say they pulled it off perfectly. You never feel like it's' too much and listening to the same music isn't getting in the way of enjoying the game.

I'll recommend the game to both fans of the series and newcomvers, but don't expect fireworks.

"This is the first review I'm ever writing, but I'm doing it because I think Pillars of Eternity deserves it so so much.

The game has an amazing story line, great dialogue and high quality writing. I'm a great fan of fantasy novels, and I felt like reading a book while actively engaging in it.

There are so many NPC characters, and you have the option to learn about their history and their motivations. It really helps to flesh out the whole game world and make it more immersive.

The gameplay itself is also a lot of fun. I love micromanaging my team of 6 characters, and this game satisfied all my needs. There are just so many possibilities to customize a character and put together a functioning team. When faced with unforeseen challanges, it is fun to be concerned with both positioning of characters and activation of their miriad of skills.

I also need to commend the art. There is so much detail in each map, and it looks wonderful. And the background music complements it beautifully.

"Jedi Outcast (along with Jedi Academy) are the two Star Wars games which best simulate the feeling of being a Jedi. No other Star Wars game has come quite as close in my opinion.

The arena styled multiplayer experience is also my favorite out of all arena shooters I've ever played. The maps are fun, and large enough to get lost in. The singleplayer campaigns are long, and at times you'll get stuck for a while trying to find the right way forward, searching for answers to puzzles or keys, but it's definitely worth playing and replaying from time to time.

Extended Review:

First off, I HIGHLY recommend this game for people who want a story. With the gripes that I have (written below), this game still stands extremely well- which should speak to just how good this game is. This is a story driven game with deductive/mystery reasoning being the engine.

I phrase it this way intentionally, as the major issue I have with the game is in determining what information is ESSENTIAL to progress through the story. There can be times where you feel that you have to determine to send between three or four pieces of information, end up sending them all, only to find out that you didn't notice that one page linked to another.

This situation of needing to progress, sending in numerous pieces of information, and finally getting the right one or realizing another page you missed, can heavily hinder the feeling of deduction and mystery solving.

"I like that I haven't died yet (lol), and that I've been able to play for hours! I usually get bored or frustrated very quickly. I'm not very practiced at First Person Shooter style games, but this one has been great, since I don't have to aim super well or react super quickly. I dislike combat but there are plenty of other things to do in this game. I like visiting new planets and finding all the plants, animals, and minerals. I'm really intrigued by the alien race Korvax, they seem to be complex, varied, and I love that they are sometimes described as multiple entities in one body, or switching based on the situation. Very cool. Wish there were a way to keep track of places you've been on a planet, as well as an easier way to navigate the galaxy map. 

Planets could do with some biome diversity.",True

"This is the best game ive ever played.. I started playing this about 6-7 months ago, and im so addicted to it. Everyday I play it for hours and hours... If you get this game im sure youll enjoy it.. I also have 832 hours... The 2.99 you spend is worth it..",True

"I've played the game on and off for two years, since it first came out in early access. It's come a long way since then, and I love a lot of core things about this game, it really is a lot of fun and a very unique experience. 

However, all of the nerfs they've been dishing out, the small amounts of money they give you from extracting with bounty tokens (compared to how expensive the better weapons/gear is) , and the recent increase in PVE damage output from NPCs and increased aggro radius they seem to have now. 

All of these things combined with many times I've questioned certain shots/plays from other players who are either God-tier players or hacking, one of the two (Keep in mind I'm an experienced player with a decent K/D ratio, lots of wins in this game, and lots of PVP gaming experience in general, so I'm not just a shitty player getting his ass kicked). 

For an example, in a match earlier today I threw a big dynamite bundle at a player in a very small shack, he was probably 3-4 meters away from the dynamite, didn't move at all (I could see him thru the window) and the dynamite did ZERO damage to him, not even a hit marker popped up. But with me theres many times I'm close to 10 meters away from a dynamite bundle, in a building when it's thrown outside the building, I'm behind two different walls and somehow I die instantly. 

And that is just one example. 

And as far a quick play goes, I'm not sure why they don't let you keep your character anymore when you win and match and still give you only like 100 or 150 hunt dollars when you win a match, its pretty much a waste of time if you're looking to get money and/or resources from it. 

All around, I think they need to address these core issues before they work on any new content or anything because players like myself (and the friends I play with) are getting fed up with these issues.",True

"Keep in mind i made this review after only playing Episode 1, but i really don't think my opinion on this game will change. :)

Life is Strange is a very addicting point and click game just like The walking Dead, the choices you make do make a bigger difference in LiS then in TwD.

Pros:

*Amazing and addicting Story
*Good graphics
*Many different choices to make that effect the story later on (both big and small differences)
*Rewind feature so you can change your choices

Cons:

*Can't really come up with any cons

I can't wait for episode 2 to come out and I really hope many people give this game a chance, especially if you have played TwD.

Tl;dr Point and click game with an amazing and addicting story

But in a serious note this game is very good. It has a feel of zero gravity when manurvering. I find it especially gratifying when you get to higher levels and unlock bigger slower weapons. This makes you strategize when to shoot and when to escape. Although the hardest difficulty and only difficulty change is a bit much. What with the wall of bullets but when you get used to it you find it to be challenging and fun. This game is very fun and is one of the reasons why i love steam so much.",True

"Last Day of June is a beautiful and short game that tells the story of a couple in a small town. The game is a Third Person adventure game but feels more like a point and click since there's not really any platforming in it. The art style and music is BEAUTIFUL. Lots of soft vibrant colors that make you feel peaceful when you're walking around town. And the music fits around the characters you play as. Oh right the characters!

So the only story element you need to know is that the story revolves around a couple, Paul and June. There was a terrible car accident and you play as Paul dealing with the grief of losing his wife. Throughout the game you will see their memories of their lives together up to the present and most importantly, you will get to play as the characters who were around the town during the day of the crash so you can save June.

From the get go you can probably guess what the story is trying to teach you, in fact the achievements sort of lay it out for you. But i implore you to play it, because there's actually a really deep meaning that the game surprised me with and by the end I was in tears...like I am right now typing this. I also love learning about the characters around town because their stories are just as important as Paul and June's. Everyone is hurting in some way and there's a twisted beauty in picking up the collectibles to learn about their pasts and why they are doing what they are doing around town.

The game was a perfect length of about 3 hours, however I have only one gripe with it. As you play as the different characters, you are trying to cause different scenarios to happen and stop the car crash. This makes long and drawn out cut scenes play that you have to watch multiple times and you CAN'T SKIP THEM. I understand there's a lesson in frustration, I really do. But there was one part where I couldn't get a collectible because I had to switch characters and in order to do that you have to go through a lot of cut scenes in order for it to happen and it added a lot of unnecessary wait time.

Despite that one gripe, I still loved this game and loved the message it was trying to get across to the player. Watching lots of people play it on Youtube I can see the ending made everyone cry like myself and that's how I know the writers and developers did a fantastic job on this game. If you're looking for a good short story with a powerful and sad message, then I highly recommend you play this game....cherish your loved ones.

TL:DR A beautiful and short Third Person Adventure/Point n Click that explores the sadness of grief in losing a loved one. Very great game but can't skip cut scenes even when you've seen them many times before and you WILL see them many times.",True

Unlike minecraft, I found the survival gameplay quite enjoyable for a large amount of time. Unfortunately you run our of stuff to do eventually, but this is not a problem that I truly need to bring up as this game is currently in development as I write this with many new enemies, items, and locations having been announced. In addition, the game has a quite vast array of items you can use to create complex machines, vehicles, flying machines, and just about anything you can think of if you have enough ingenuity. I highly recommend anyone who loves sandbox/survival games to try this out for yourself.

"Now, this is quite rare for me. Normally I put way more hours into a game before writing a review but I feel as though I have a lot to say even now so here goes.

Dead Cells is an incredible game with fast paced, engaging combat with many different enemies, weapons and playstyles. The biomes are beautiful and the bosses are really cool.
The runes are nice and can allow you acces to new biomes and bosses. And collecting and spending cells feels soo rewarding.

But there is one thing that I think I should mention. As a person who loves roguelike/ roguelite games and plays them often I feel as though, overall, this one is relatively easy. 
I have got 5 hours in and i have already gotten to the 3rd boss and almost beaten him And i don't like that. 
The biomes, while they do get harder, never get THAT hard and I can progress through them with relative ease. I don't know if it is because I play a lot of these games or what, but this game, at least to me, is not very hard.",True

"The Good:
Game is pretty well balanced with each army having a specialty to them. And while I haven't played many RTS I do like this one for it's accuracy in some regards. The graphics are cool as well especially with higher settings.

The Bad:
Games crashes irregularly. Drop rates for anything is sparse.
Overly the game is alright. But still needs a lot of work. 
Edit: Buggy has fucking hell. Nerfed and money hungry has hell.
Don't waste your money til they fix it.

Long story short I can't really recommend this game, but at the same time if you want a decent WWll RTS then this is a pretty good one has far as I know in comparison too other.

"Ok it's been a while since I played this game.  I wasn't sure what to think of it initially.
After leaving some time to digest, I would allegorise the experience like this:  You walk into a store with a friend. While you are browsing they ask you to let them know if anyone is coming.  Thinking they need a private moment, you agree.  Then, jogging past you, they say “I stuffed my pockets with chocolates” and run out of the store without paying, making you an accomplice in their crime.  To make matters worse they get you to agree to protect them because the chocolates are for starving children.  BUT then you discover there are no starving children!  Worse there were not even any chocolates!  All you are left with is your real complicity in an unreal crime.  But wait there’s more… you pay money for the experience!  

On the positive side it is clever, perceptive and emotionally powerful.  However I did not find it inspirational.

Perhaps it is really just the subject matter and introverted perspective that lets the game down or, perhaps the author just takes your money and slaps you in the face.  I don’t know the answer to that question.  

I would give it a neutral review if it was available.

"Dead Space 2 features a larger setting than the first game, with more human interactions and even gave Isaac a voice and personality. The FOV is larger now, and the controls are no longer messy. This sequel features more action rather than the horror atmosphere in the first one and a more flexible combat system (melee and Telekinesis are actually useful in combat). They also added multiple different skins for the Necromorphs and even some new types not seen before. I like the varied settings of the levels but I think this game lacks a decent final battle like the first one.",True
"The first thing i would like to say is that i ws actually surprised about the quality of the game. This game, was great when it game to graphics. The blood, the story, everything. Though there were facts of the story in this game, that i dont think goes together correctly with the previous games. I wasn't too bothered by it, but i think others could be. The fighting mechanics are really unique when it came between the angel and demon weaponry and the enemies to match. There are special enemies every so often that are only affected by the angel/demon weapons. I thought it made the game more interesting. The game length was pretty long, not going to lie. took me a full day to beat, not too bad. One thing, the bosses other than the final, and one before, were a bit of a challenge, the rest were pretty simple to beat when you notice the obvious attack patterns. To me, it made be say because here, all the normal fights between the demon and angel spawns, are epic, where the bosses, didn't compare to it. they were... boring to say the least.  Compared to Devil May Cry 3 and 4 (I highly recommend playing by the way) There were bosses that made my blood boil because they were fun, and had to rely on timing. Oh one more thing. The language in this game is funny, very hateful and messed up things are said, definitely not to be played around children, but it also annoyed me, because the other games barely cursed, were this one curses in almost every scene. My final rating after playing the game, is about a: 3.75 out of 5. I would rate it a 4 if the price was lower. not worth 50, but it is still fairly new. But if it's on sale, definitely worth the buy!

"[h1]BUY THIS GAME[/h1]
I used to love Locomotion and Railroad Tycoon, and this is a solid 201X version of these games.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
-Industries can change their output. Very useful, but if you don't pay attention goods start stacking up and eventually output decays to zero. They do this automatically, increasing output if regular trains/lorries come by, or decreasing if ignored.
-Realism. Each train engine, train car, tram, etc. actually exists (or existed) in real life, and there's a little bit of history about it in the buy menu, which is really cool. Also, the models don't look cheaply done. Someone spent a while working on them.
-Towns can be influenced with a variety of factors. Want a town to grow faster? Give it some goods or industrial materials. Also, connecting a town to multiple others (more than 3) results in accelerated growth.
-Towns actively build themselves towards transport hubs. Build near the fringes to save money and provide the town a tram line and BAM! Wait a few years and you might not be able to see the station (no exageration).
-Pricing is determined based off distance and volume of goods, not just volume of goods (makes it more realistic).

[h1]Cons[/h1]
-Unlike Railroad Tycoon, you cannot build or buy industries without mods.
-Using mods (this includes additional train models and other assets, like new factories and buildings) disables achievements... I'd personally seperate ""mods"" and ""assets"" into two categories, and allow assets to count towards achievements.
-After it runs for a while, performance drops significantly. Cannot figure out why (like 1 day will take minutes instead of seconds).
      EDIT: I may have figured out why. I cannot manually select it to use my NVIDIA 940M instead of Intel Integrated Graphics... as the IIG warms up, it slows down significantly, resulting in lower framerate and thus a slower game.
-No feature to group lines to have similar replacements. Its a pain with 30 or 40+ lines to update the line replacement if a new engine or car comes out.
-Autogenerated maps occasionally place industries in the same supply chain exteremly far apart, unlike the campaign where most things are within a short train ride of each other. For instance, in one game I'm playing, there's 4 loging camps on one side of the map and all the processing mills are on the other, which means I can't make anything requiring planks without a very expensive setup >.<
-Upgrading tracks will frequently result in ""collision errors"" with signals or buildings around stations. This is the biggest pain of the entire game by far, since in late game when you want to build high-speed electric trains you either have to delete a whole bunch of things and hope to god your fixes work, or just deal with sections being slower than the high-speed rail.

BULLSHT

The only thing roots related is WW2. Rest is bogus.

- Where are the server lists?
- Where are the big multiplayer maps like Foy, Kursk, Ponyri with tanks in them?
- Where are the fun game modes like Base Assault?
- Where is the cheat free environment?

Yes, let's talk about the cheating a little bit. If you want to play this game, you must purchase an aimbot to make it fair, because there is an aimbotter in almost every match. Don't worry about bans, because this game has no working anticheat system. At least, with servers lists, the server admins would be able to ban cheaters. 

This game posesses nearly nothing from the roots.",False
"After looking this game for about an hour and watching a few videos, I bough it for the low price of £6. While I did have fun at first, I found that it became quite repetitive after some time. Combat doesn't feel very fast or challenging in any way and nothing is hard at all literally anyone could do it which is a positive for newbies but a huge con for 99% of people as there is no challenge or progression. Melee combat is especially poor, as bayonet thrusts are slow and easily avoided if you're on the receiving end and most bots won't even try to attack you but you can mow down 50+ with no effort.  To evaluate, a good game for 20 minutes of feeling like a god and then it gets extremely stale and boring.

"Let me just say that this could be a great game.

The combat is fast and intuitive. The spells mostly pretty varied and interesting. The enemies are really tough and challenging. There's only one thing that screws all this up.

The game doesn't tell you what anything does. You have no idea what relics do when you pick them up unless you can just figure it out for yourself. It also doesn't tell you jack shit about anything in the shops. It doesn't tell you what items in the store do, it doesn't tell you what spells do or even what kind of spell they are. The game honestly expects you to just gamble on every single purchase you make and that's really fucking stupid.

From relics to spells the game gives you no information about anything and that's just completely unacceptable. The items that show up are already random but you honestly expect the player to try and work out what every single item and relic does and then just remember it by looks and name? Why would anyone want to do that?

There is a right way and a wrong way to extend gameplay, forcing the player to basically play the game with the wiki open at all times is a fucking terrible way to design a game. Why on god's green earth would you give me five options at a store and then not tell me anything about any of them? How does that make me able to make meaningful decisions about what I'm doing if I have no idea what anything does? It's just a shitty way to extend game time.

Add to this the already punishing difficulty and the lack of healing between stages and you have a recipe for a really grindy time. It's such a shame because the combat is so good but the way they handle shops and unlocks is just so bad it ruins the whole experience.

Other than that is shares Dead cell's totally counter intuitive unlock system. If you unlock enough items in a set tier of items (relics or Spells) it opens up the next tier of spells/relics to show up in game. What this actually does is add a shit load of stuff to the pool of things that can show up. You depending on a specific ability or item? Well if you unlock too much stuff you just make it harder to find specific things.

Add to all this the red portal vendors (who are randomized) show up and three of them are basically worthless and you have a recipe for annoying.

Two of the vendors take a random spell from you and give you a random spell or item in return. Why would I want to lose one of the four spells I picked to start the game? I picked it how is me gambling on a random spell that might not help at all an appealing option?

All in all the game has a lot of promise, the dev's just make several really bad design decisions that add nothing to the game and one really bad decisions that seriously cripples it.

If they ever add item descriptions to the shop I'd probably recommend it whole heartedly but as long as they insist on hiding basic information like what relics actually do I can't recommend it. It's a really cheesy way to up difficulty.",False

Rimworld gives me better graphics, though at the expense of some resource-heavy stuff like z-levels and heat-induced state-changes. (Dwarf Fortress has a lot of moving parts.) While letting me take manual control when I need people to do specific things. Like, in Dwarf Fortress the entire guard-force might decide to wander off to get drunk, and when they fight they'll go running around one at a time and get killed. In Rimworld, I can order people to put on or remove items directly, order them to stand guard in specific places, and so on. Rimworld also lets me adjust my difficulty setting in-game, rather than having to guess at what'd strike a nice balance instead of either destroying my fort before I have weapon-production or never sending any threats at me and leaving me with little to do.",True

"As a northern Jarl. My ambition was to unify the Northern people, as my father had did before me. I set out and subjecated my neighbours. Soon Norway, Sweden, Denmark and half of Finland was mine. My most favored and ONLY son, a true prodigy of my blood line; did me proud when he said he wanted to service in the Byzantine Varangian Guard.

With tears in the back of my throat, my heart beating with pride as I saw the ship sail away to a golden sunset. Many months passed without a word from my son. I had many daughters in his absence. I ruled and I went and conquered the Saxon kingdom. The south was open for the taking.

I reccive words after putting down a foolish rebellion. That sails bearing the family standard. A Golden tree on a field of green. I made prepartions in the hall. Odin be praised! My son was finally home! As the doors slams open and a man I barely recognize as my son steps into the light. He seems ashamed despite my smiles. After the feast, I told him it was time for him to take on a wife and make a family.

Dark became the hall when he told me the news of deeds in the Byzantine Varangian Guard. Sleeping with one of the wifes of the Emperor. He had lost his manhood. I had not gotten my son back... but another daughter.

I told my housecarls to seize the creature before me and put him in chains. He did not scream nor complain as my men dragged him away. I have to respect him for that.

The day came when it was time for blot, so I personally was the one who placed the blade at my former son's throat and made the leathal blow. The Jarls of the Kingdom, seemed pleased at this. But I knew that behind their false smiles that their resentment of me was now higher without an heir. I had only daughters.

Who would have known that my sons life was connected to my own. Bloodlines are like trees. Roots are the ancestors, the trunk are you and the branches are the children. Now without the branches my line has come to an end.

As I see the army of my wifes brother come over the hills eager to see my head detached from my body, I can only think what will happen to my memory. Will someone remember this bloodline? Or will we fade into oblivion? Even so, I will see my son in Valhalla. And there we will feast with the Aesir. Odin see me!

then you have the dialogs, the pain of the characters, dealing with death, thinking of survival, an entire array of options.

I have played every total war game since Medieval 2 and this is the best of the series by far. The unique factions and lore really allow the core design of total war games to shine.

Only problem I had was that I had to create a new Rockstar social club account because the one I was trying to login to was saying the password was wrong.(But thats only a minor problem that wasn't the games fault)

"Aside from there being way too many circles ending at the Military base which forces people across 1 of 2 bridges where people camp or swimming, I love the game. I'll recommend it but this whole ""random circle"" thing needs to not land on military island more than half the time.

I am now going to revoke my recommendation. Still getting about 75% mil island circles and it's getting a tad annoying. I will keep you updated, but seeing as the developers can't fix simple issues I don't see this going away anytime soon. I'm going back in for another try, I have high hopes. Wish me luck.

Dear Diary,
I'm writing to you again to say the last 3 games in a row all ended at Mil Base...it's getting kind of old. Also, one of the developers thought fog was a good idea...because getting killed out of no where is fun when they're 5 feet away and you can't see them.

"Entering this game with a friend was the kick off to many killed hours. 
Friend said normal difficulty would be good enough, I begged to differ. We settled on Hell on Earth difficulty. A few minutes later we were seperated, each surrounded by terrifying undead-looking zed creatures, and still didn't even know the controls. To put it simply, we stood no chance on that poorly-lighted ranch. We lost horribly. Nevertheless, we go back into it and suddenly there's been over thirty hours sunk into the game. Still suck just as much, but enjoy the game just as much.",True

"If you have ever played the Mafia game using a deck of cards or have the Werewolf set you know exactly what this game is. It is a clever social game where the werewolves attempt to allude the villagers for one night, and everyone has to figure out who the werewolves are. There are multiple roles, but not enough where it is clunky or too complicated. I am used to playing the old Mafia version with a deck of cards so coming in to this game I am used to having multiple nights where people are voted out every night, where this game differs is it only has one night and one vote. 

I think this is a good step for the game, because it keeps everyone involved and does not risk fracturing the servers when people inevitably quit out because they were killed. The rounds feel like the perfect amount of time. So far the population of this game seems to be good, I had no problem finding a full server and played with some awesome people, laughing and having a great time as we all attempted to persuade each other to further our own agendas. I am using the VIVE and I thought it was brilliant that Ubisoft is offering Crossplay between Oculus and PSVR. There still is Uplay you have to deal with, which personally does not bother me but may bother some of you. 

I was a little dissapointed that I could not use my VIVE controllers to move my hands 1:1. You use the controllers to select emotes and gestures you can make, which still felt pretty fluid. The game has many clever features, such as if you stand up to plead your case it temporarily mutes the other players so they hear your case. 

Overall, yes I agree the price might be a bit high for some people, and I do worry that long term it might hurt the player base, but as it stands right now I reccomend this game. I truly felt like I was with a group of friends laughing and having a great time and that is what VR is about for me.",True

This game has everything you would want from a survival game; the building creation is great, it isnt built from blocks it's actual walls and ceilings, which makes a change. The whole thing with an island full of dinos is AMAZING; esepecially when you get to tame them for your self! The game gives you an adrenaline rush wether you are in PvE or PvP as the game is just as good in both (obv you die more in PvP :P) overall for game a 10/10.

Dev. team also get a 10/10 as they keep working with the game and they listen to what players want. It is absaloutly amazing the amount of new HIGH QUALITY content they churn out, that WORKS! New dino dossiers are popping up left right and centre and this is very exciting.

Plus its easier to build up relationships with others, the cutscenes that can occur are very nicely made with some being very funny (like the reaction for dunking the Mayor's ""unmentionables"" in the 'pot-luck' soup), and the crafting elements allow for players to make nicely designed farms and homes.

"Been playing Torchlight 1 and 2 for years. It's one of...maybe three or four worthwhile ""Diablo-likes"". My Girlfriend picked it up on sale and loves it, as well, and she doesn't really like video games that aren't on Switch or 3DS (which, I believe, this is...and/or TL1). Anyway, long story short...get the game, especially if you like Diablo 2. This doesn't feel like 3, which I like, but I know that one really turned people off to Diablo...so there's that for you.

It's a button smasher / point and click with minecraft graphics.  Also I didn't spot this so please be warned, this is ONLY part one of a 5 part series, and it takes less then 2 hours to complete.  At over 10 bucks an hour thats expensive, and I see no mention if the other 4 parts are gonna be DLC or jsut updates to this purchase.  I suspect they will all be DLC,  So expect the full game to be expensive for probably a 6 hour playthrough...

Saying that though,  It is nicely done.  Although given it's Mine - Craft...  It had no mining, and only 2 or 3 crafts.  The story is pretty good though.",False

"Now here's a good indie game. Jamestown is a top-down shooter (such as 19XX) with the odd plot of being a convict on the lamb trying to redeem your name in the new world. The year is 1619, and the new world happens to be Mars.
You battle your way through Martian and Spanish forces and uncover a diabolical plot all in the safety of the cutscenes. The rest of the time you're blowing your way through anything that gets in your way.
The 4 ships you have to choose from are a bit limiting, but varied and each useful in their own way. This is also where the game shows it's true awesomeness. If you can get some friends together on the same computer, you can team up with whatever selection of ships you want and blow away the Martians and evil Spanish.
A great game, I'd advise it for anyone.",True

"It's was okay experience. Half of the game is boring, when playing on normal difficulty. The game picks up with the 4th level(world). It has some rpg mechanics with points to the stats of the character improve/increase or the weapon/magic of your choice. It's probably better,when you play 2nd time when you can experiment with the playstyle you want and maybe on harder difficulty. Most of the boss battles are generic, but for the final boss I'll give props to devs. It feels a bit survival,when you have limited resources,but when you have all what you need it's hit or miss with the levels. By the way it's heavily inspired by oldschool wolfenstein game with the level design. Sometimes you can get lost in the maze,since almost everything is so similar. It's hard to believe,but there are FPS drops in this game. In the final battle on low graphic settings I had drops to 24 fps, not great. There are a lot of graphical  options but I would prefer if the game auto adjusted ,so that I would have 60+ fps performance. Audio is also hit or miss. Sometimes tracks are good and catchy and sometimes it's so generic so it's hit or miss. Overall I enjoyed the game and it's a good throwback to the 90's. Be open minded when playing this game. It's great, but it's not bad. It's...ok.",True

wonderful messes arent for everyone. and battlerite isnt for me.
I was a founder and in 2017 i deleted the game enraged. summer 2019 i jumped back in with new stamina and high hopes. i played about 6o hours in total and somewhere around 3oo games. didnt get very far and certainly didnt improve. at all.
since it started, a lot changed to the better but the thing that bothers me most didnt change at all.
Battlerite is hard.
you need to study, you need to train. you need to practise and stick to it.
its not a game you just play 30 min before bed. its not a game you boot while eating.
Battlerite is a commitment.
Its a nice game. it works. it has looks. it lacks players. the queuetimes can be endless. the players are friendly. mostly. somtimes. a few of them.

Also, The implementation of The Missing link directly into the walkthrough gives you much better and complex expirience from the game.

You start with a simple house, a huge plot to work, and a push out the door to go do whatever the heck you want. 

There are events in this game. Both events that happen on certain days (Like the Beach Luau or the Flower Dance) that the whole town gets involved with. Then their are other events, not sure if they are random or what, but they happen and it makes the game feel so alive. There are over 20 towns people in this game and they are apart of these events. When you catch 2 kids playing in a strange spot, to someone losing their axe, to 'some racooons' rummaging in the garbage you gotta go stop.  It's the little story elements and exploration that help this game keep that magical charm. 

The music helps! It's so beautiful and fun and light.

You can farm, chop, mine, cook, craft, fish (man I love the fishing in this game. It's not the most amazing system, but I enjoy it. You cast your reel, wait for the 'ding' and start the mini-game. You just tap the bar to keep it lined up with the fish. It's so simple and oddly so satisfying.) 

Money is a huge portion of this game. You are always wanting it. You are always needing to use it. And how you go about in the world is a factor in how you obtain it.

The friendship system is probably the weaker part of the game for me. Players on the discussion forum say it's par for the course for these games, but it sure is a doozy to get use to. Being friends with over 20+ villagers can be a little scary. There are 5 women and 5 men to choose from for a spouse. I have not gotten this far yet. So even with the weak friendship system, I still enjoy the chase to woo one of those to move in with me. I do know you can have up to 2 children, and your spouse will help you on your farm.

I'll shut up now. But I really implore you to try this game out and have a blast with it. It's not Overwhelmingly Positve for nothing! There is a lot of customization for your character and as far as I can tell, there is a lot of ways to boost your house the way you want. Just like Animal Crossing, you can get furniture for it, paint the walls, lay carpet and go to bed.  

Enjoy!

"Men of War is a Real-Time Tactics game where instead of building bases like in the Real-Time Strategy genre, you're given command of a wide range of unit types ranging from standard infantry to armour and emplaced weapons. 

One of the more standout features of the game is that each infantry unit has an inventory of its own, allowing you to ""appropriate"" headgear, weapons and equipment from fallen allies and foes alike. Hell, you can even take control of abandoned vehicles or emplaced weapons and use them against your enemies. There is also the Direct Control feature which allows you to take control of a unit's movement and firing. Very useful when you're trying to take out enemies with a sniper rifle or adjusting your tank's aim to score a kill. 

But be warned that there is a learning curve to the game and you'll need to get used to mechanics such as armour penetration, unit line of sight and visibility.

The game also supports Co-op so if you feel that you're overwhelmed by the number of units that you have to command on any given mission, you could get your friends to join in. When I was playing with a friend of mine, he loved to just give me command of all of his units save one as he was more comfortable with controlling a single soldier at a time.",True
"A small, but great game about surviving in a town plagued by a war. In This War Of Mine, you play as a group of people (or just one guy, your choice) to survive in the fictional town of Pogoren during a conflict between some rebels and the army. Each character has his/her own story. It's best to find out the game's mechanics first, then restart your story and play through it again. You'll search for food, bandages, weapons and medicine to battle sickness, wounds and hunger. People will die, but if you help others they will help you. You can steal or barter, kill or get killed. Each action has consequences, some small, some gigantic. You need to battle winter, outbreaks of crime and the army storming the town. You can betray your friends for rewards and guilt, or keep them safe and suffer.

In the end, it is your choice, and the ending will be based around the choices you make.

A con would be that the game isn't too full of content, but in my opinion it doesn't need that. This game is great with the ammount of resources to play with it gives you, you make your own content.

By buying this game, a small percentage will go to charity, which I find great.

Anyways, buy the game!

"Had a harder time finding a shooter that plays to the sensibilities of an older gamer who grew-up playing Medal of Honor before it stunk, and the original Call of Duty in high school with friends. This one brings some of that back, and then some. No single-player needed, just some good friends who can call in Arty (artillery) and know how to snipe flame-throwers at a distance.

"My X-posted youtube comment I made in response to a vid that concluded DayZ was not worth buying, largely because of its current cost. I think this sums up my opinion as someone who has spent a lot of time and thought playing the game and considering its past, present and future. TLDR; It's worth the money.

I really liked the vid! When you conclude however, I think your reasoning for whether it is worth buying or not needs to take a couple things into consideration. Your conclusion seems largely based on the cost of the game in its current state. First, look at two of the most recent game releases. Fallout 76. Nuff Said, except that it costs 59.99 US or 79.99 'deluxe.' Atlas, a lazy, broken and blatant reskin of Ark that was originally coded only as a small expac for Ark. Early access for 30$. 

Secondly, games cost more than they did two or five years ago so the price of Dayz is actually market median and relatively reasonable. People were paying close to 200$ for early access to Tarkov, and people continue to blow money on skins and gambling and other greedy microtransactions. Not to mention WoW which not only charges 15/month, but also requires people regularly purchase 60$ 'expansions.'

Lastly, DayZ is a unique, fun game which has stood the test of time and will be around for a good 5 to 10 years with mods. More importantly, Bohemia uses funds from sales to continue developing DayZ and the Enfusion engine, which will be the the basis of future games like Arma 4 and from other studios which use the engine. Sales wont last forever, but people want to continue to see improvements in content and playability, and they want to see more games from Bohemia. 

You aren't just paying for a copy, you are paying for your experience over time in DayZ and other games, which requires money from you and a lot more from developers. If you enjoy DayZ and want to see it improved and expanded over time as it already is and will be, I think it is well worth the cost. You won't ever play anything quite like it.",True

"Well, Owlboy has made its way into my top 10 favorite games of all time. After completing the game, I was left feeling a slew of emotions from the result of an amazing story.

PROS:
[*][u]Atmosphere[/u]: This game's soundtrack along with amazing polished visuals help create some of the most beautiful atmospheres I could ever experience. No detail was left out.

[*][u]Mechanics[/u]: The gameplay and its mechanics I found were very easy to grasp and are fun to use. The controls are smooth and very responsive. The game mechanics vary in interesting ways that always gave me something new or challenging to play with.

[*][u]Story[/u]: Owlboy is a highly story-driven game, and it is done well. There are a few little side missions and collectibles here and there, but the story takes grasp of most things the player will do. It is beautifully told, and I highly recommend paying attention to it, as it will push you to play more and more.

CONS:
[*][u]Game Length[/u]: When I play games, I like to explore every nook and cranny. Even with the way I play games, Owlboy only took me 9.1 hours to complete. I wish there was a bit more content to keep me busy as I feel like I blasted through this game, even though I explored it thoroughly.

[*][u]Final Boss Fight[/u]: [spoiler] I did enjoy having to use all 3 of my followers to help me defeat the final boss, however, I felt it was a bit too easy compared to previous boss fights. The fact that I didn't have to fight Mostrom was a bit disappointing as well.[/spoiler]",True

"[b]Think: Gang Beasts, but more puzzles and climbing[/b], that's what this game is. However, [u]I would rate Human: Fall Flat much higher than the aforementioned title[/u] for many reasons:

- It has one of the best physics based puzzelers I have played, ever.
- Controlling your character feels amazing, it's simple, but works so well.
- There is a decent character editor.
- The multiplayer experience is fantastic; just hop into a game and help solve puzzles with others.
- The game is filled with amazing set pieces; you can pretty much drive or tamper with whatever machine you see (my favorite being the cargo ship on the water level :D).
- There is more than one way to solve each puzzle, making for a really satisfying experience when you solve something your own way.

   I have had a blast with this game! I was skeptical when I purchased it initially, but since then I have become infatuated by it and will totally come back to it again and again. The only gripes I have are the occasional bug and that there are only a few levels at this moment, but if there was a level editor the replayability of this game would be awesome!

Every monster you hunt will always bring something to the table even if you hunted it a thousand times they could surprise you. While I will say you can only play so much by yourself before you get bored or get tired of losing, having at least one friend with you can make a huge difference and you'll find out just how many ways you can play this alone or together.

"Fantastic fun FPS classic renowned not just for its unashamed good cheesy humour throughout, but also for its frenetic addictive gameplay. The developers haven't bothered updating the sprite graphics and animations, and I don't find the flamethrower final boss in World Tour section to be impressive, but because it's a great game anyway, I forgive them (I got it on discount too). The basic game anyway is on par with the Doom games, but Duke Nukem has some advantages over Doom. There is more variety in level design, it has some inventive and unusual weapons such as a shrink gun and ice gun. And Duke Nukem has tons of secrets and jokey easter eggs to discover, which adds replay value.",True

"I'm not going to lie: I actually enjoyed my first hours into this bug-filled crap. I'm into farming and resource gathering games. I spend my entire free time playing MMOs, which is the prime example of farming gear and profession mats.

BUT, with that being said, I literally can't believe I'm farming the SAME materials in every single planet or system I've visited so far! Even the planets feel the same, just with a different color pallet attached to the, with climate changes (btw, with only 3 shallow possibilities: cold as fuck, hot as fuck or radioactive as fuck).

Come on, Hello Games, I really tried to enjoy this, but the game is the same crap, no matter where you go, from your first planet to the middle of the goddamn universe. There's nothing to keep you attached to this, absolutely nothing. Can't believe I wasted 18 hours of my time on this shit. There's no sense of progress, you can't even stop for 5 minutes without having to farm elements to keep your suit and ship functioning properly.

Please, If you value your time (unlike me, apparently), stay away from this game, It's not worth the buzz. Stay away from Hello Games while you're at it, they're outright liars. It's not even the same game as it was advertised for the past 3 or 4 years.

"Pros:
~The music is just amazing. It's pretty common in JRPS's to have epic orchestral tracks, and this one is no different. Love it
~Great storyline. It's a bit typical at times but the world feels real and the characters make it all enjoyable.
~Fun combat. There's enough diversity to play to your style, though I will say towards the end there are clear and obvious OP builds
~Most of the characters are pretty cool. The only playable character I didn't like is the little sis from the German city.

Cons:
~No voice acting. Major bummer. This game shines even without it, but some VA would really take it to another level.
~It's pretty texty. I like reading and didn't mind, but many people don't want to skim through all that non-skippable text.
~The 2D art is pretty good. The block toons definitely show their age, but it's not bad.

"It's a solid FPS about killing lots of monsters. 

Combat is very fun and free flowy with double jumps, powerful weapons and a focus on moving around instead of taking cover. Combat is pretty much all you do though, if you want an FPS with a truly engaging story this is not the game for you. 

The story was very interesting and i was very engaged by it, reading every data log and so on. However nothing ever pays off, the story just ends unfinished without any real feeling. As someone who really wanted a big finale to everything I was dissapointed with the, in my opinon, abrupt ending. 

However the game is very well made, runs very well, and is extremely fun despite being repeteative.

"While it looks like a Darkest Dungeons clone, it isn't. Let me clarify this immediately. Now that I clarified this, lets get to the details. First, the negative.

This game suffers from what I like to call XCOM syndrome. During this game, your characters will come across situations that require a skill check, which in itself makes sense, considering how many different things can happen. But like XCOM, you can never 100 percent anything. Even if you've maxed out your corresponding stat. Most you can get is 95 percent. Not bad? Sure, but again, like XCOM, this is a lie. I once tried an event that I had a 95 percent chance of succeeding 4 times in a row, and every time was a failure. I'm not great at math, but I'm pretty sure that's near fucking impossible. So the stats you are shown must be lie of some sort. Now, this wouldn't bother me so much if certain events (Story specific ones especially) didn't have consecutive attempts required to complete. Example, the first three checks you pass, but the last one you fail. This results in injury or a curse or something else you obviously won't want, but not only that, you have to start over again. So imagine the frustration of knowing exactly how to get a task done, but only to be denied constantly by bullshit stat checks that are stacked against you. And at most, these checks will require different stats, so you'll rarely ever have favorable stat checks. At most, I had characters having around a (supposedly) 60 percent chance all around. So for whoever can do the math, 60 percent times 4, what are the chances of success for making every single one of those checks? This also carries into the battle mode. Attacks that are supposed to hit with a 95 percent chance will miss half the time. Classic XCOM syndrome. So whoever did the math, stats, and numbers of the game don't know how numbers really work. Again, I'm not a math wiz, but I can flip a coin. And I've never flipped a coin 10 times and got heads every single time...... twice. Oh yeah, this was on easy mode apparently. I never play games on easy mode unless it cheats. I didn't even have to do that for XCOM. 
This game also seems like it might be rouge like, but all events are scripted. Once you learn how something can be done, you just need to remember how you did it before.
As time goes on, characters have these interactions nightly. And in all honesty, this is what I enjoyed most about the game. HOWEVER, you only have 120 days before the game ends. And sometimes, characters won't initiate interactions that lead to a better ending. So you're forced to finish the game before characters can really finish their individual stories.

Ok, now the positive.
AMAZING art! Fun characters, and I was genuinely interested with how the characters developed as time continued on. 

So in conclusion, I enjoyed the story, but the whole game aspect of it isn't quite figured out yet. There still needs to be fixes. Even though I said the game suffers from XCOM syndrome, XCOM allows at least a bit of leeway room with screw ups. And yes, I did finish the game so I actually know what I'm talking about. 

Either wait till they make a couple of fixes, or wait for it to go on sale. As of now, it's a nice resource management visual novel that suffers from an inaccurate (or just plain lying) math.... algorithm? Whatever the word is for programming a math formula. I'm on the fence honestly. I can't say it's bad, but I can't say it's good. But it's not Darkest Dungeons.",False

"Rainbow 6: Siege is nothing like other games in this series as it is a pure multiplayer game. There are 10 short situations just for the tutorial.

R6S is a team death match game 5v5 with objective just like CSGO with realistic elements. you can lean gun, throw the grenade to destroy the wall and floor to kill the opponent on the other side. The hardest part in this game is you need to remember the map to gain the advantage against opponents. The sound in R6S is critical because every time you move, swap weapon, or even turn around make a sound.

There are 28 operators that you can play (at the end of season 1), 14 from attackers and 14 from defenders. Each operator has their unique skill and playstyle. So it's very hard to master just one operator and there are 28 of them with additional 8 operators to come this year.

"After spending in/around 1900 hours on this game I initially believed despite a at times toxic community, this game was a great product, I still believe it's a great idea,beautiful and incredibly well executed at times with massive amounts of room for potential improvement.

However community toxicity combined with a corrupt management and abusive lead developer have caused me to change my mind.

After a recent issue in Policy change regarding family sharing seemed to cause a disturbance in the community who began to ask the development team for answers  due to no prior warning in a cancellation of steam family sharing policy the response of the lead developer Dondi was at best very defensive without reason to incredibly abusive.

the level of incompetence he is known for I originally disregarded as rumour and groups of people being over-judgemental. after seeing it first hand I would not invest in this game. I became invested myself and would have remained a loyal follower if not for the absolutely disgusting childish immature behaviour of this grown man and content creator who aspires to be more.

We may all have bad days but from what I've began to gather. that is all this product creator has and at some point it may effect you should you decide to support him.

"While at the moment the game feels more like a tower defense than a real RTS, this game is still pretty good and constantly updated.

However, the only gamemode available AT THE MOMENT of this review is survival, it is pretty tense and I don't think it is possible to actually beat it, but rather survive as much as you can and grab a spot on the leaderboard like in Space Pirate Trainer.
It doesn't really give you time to breath which some people might like or dislike, I'm on the latter.

More gamemodes with more lax settings would be amazing, and even a singleplayer campaign with ""scenarios"", such as having to play as a sniper, with some voice introductions like in the tutorial, and some neat other bonuses like in Command and Conquer Generals.

"[h1] DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine [/h1]

[quote] PLEASE NOTE: Although Steam says that I have played Just Cause 3 for 9 hours (on the review page), I have played for roughly 14-15 hours, there either is a glitch in the overall run-time or I don't know how many hours I play when it comes to games... decide for yourself [/quote]

I finished Just Cause's main storyline, I finished Just Cause 2's main storyline... what about Just Cause 3?

Sadly, I have to say I had to struggle through this whole damn game to finish it (main story only!). Just Cause 3 is definitely not the game I was expecting from Avalanche Studios... Just Cause was good. Just Cause 2 was much, much better. Then, Just Cause 3 comes into the world of gaming and s*its all over the previous games. Just Cause 3 was certainly the weakest of the series...

Just Cause 3 was sadly developed by Avalanche Studios and published by Sqaure Enix. The story vaguely continues from where Just Cause 2 left off. You've finished your job from the sequel and now Rico Rodriguez returns to his birth place, Medici. A corrupt place, just the same as the previous two games by the way, with a corrupt government and a corrupt president, by the way... just the same as the previous two games! As Rico, you have to take back what is rightfully the citizens of Medici... freedom!

The game is an open world, third-person action game. Where you shoot, blow up stuff and complete the copy and paste missions and side missions. The story is the same as always and is boring and stupid. The characters I couldn't give a rat's behind about. They are the most stereotypical type of Italian/Mexican/Latino people you could ever lay your eyes upon

Just to clear it out of the way, the voice acting is terrible in Just Cause 3. Rico's voice actor is obviously different than Just Cause 2 (even his appereance can never remain the same!), his friend who (ironically!) is called Mario and has the worst Italian accent I could ever listen to (ha ha ha, very funny! They got the idea from Super Mario... ha... ha... ha...) and the other minor characters that you see in the game are terribly voice acted

I must admit, the game does look beautiful and they really pushed the graphics up from the previous game. Just Cause 2's world was beautiful but Just Cause 3 was a sort of improvement from Just Cause 2. And of course, blowing up stuff makes a return from the previous game and was the most fun I had in this... game. However, the game ran so poorly with settings on high, couldn't even run the game on very high without a few frame rate drops here and there, even turned down to medium the game ran poorly (GeForce GTX 980 Ti) and my PC overheated so many times that I had to stop playing for a couple of hours to cool it off

The A.I, good God the A.I in this game is dumb. There are no difficulty options, fair enough, but the soldiers, the rebels and even people walking along or driving are brain dead and stupid. Soldiers running into each other and running into walls and out in the open. Rebels stand straight in the firing line, getting shot constantly and civilians hitting each other whilst driving and other brain dead stuff. Just Cause 2's A.I was way better than this!

The missions... good God were the side missions annoying and felt like actual copy and paste. They made the same mechanic that I hated from Just Cause 2, you have to play a certain amount of side missions before unlocking the main mission to continue the stupid poorly written story. But, the side missions were so bad and were exactly identical to each other (destroying billboards, destroying loudspeakers... same challenges and so on and so fourth!), you either make a good open world game or don't bother at all

The map system in this game is God awful. The always online DRM was annoying as hell (ironically, even the police in Medici are called DRM, what coincidence is that!). The game ran like horse s*it and load times were awful (even a game like Rise of the Tomb Raider, which came out this year (2016) for PC ran better than this trash (which came out in 2015, might I add))

You can tell that Avalanche Studios gave more focus to their other game Mad Max (which came out roughly the same year this game came out (2015)) since although that game wasn't the greatest (in terms of story telling and so on), it was certainly better than this trash. I hope Just Cause doesn't make a return in Just Cause 4 (but knowing Sqaure Enix it will), because Just Cause 3 made me not want to return to the Just Cause franchise

When I come to recommending it or not, I would whole heartidly say to steer clear away from this one. If you want a game that you can blow up stuff and have fun in an open world environment, Just Cause 2 is the answer and it comes with a multiplayer mod

Just Cause 3, for me personally, killed my liking for the series

"  Многие в свое время сильно распинались, рассказывая, как игра ужасна, со временем негатив улегся и игра явила множество своих плюсов. Расскажу только о тех минусах, которые не получается простить или не заметить.

  1. Постоянная попытка постанавливать сцену. То камера сама начнет лететь на ""нужный"" объект/взрыв, то персонажам запрещается использовать бег или стрелять.  Поверьте, если сцена хороша, я так на нее посмотрю, зачем конкретно поворачивать мне голову и связывать руки/ноги?
  2. Скриптованность появления врагов. В RE4, RE5, Dead Space и других играх я могу увидеть притворяющегося мертвым врага и заранее его продырявить. Но здесь это не только нельзя сделать, все хуже - зомби неуязвим пока встает, и только когда он ""красиво поднимется в него будет входить урон. Это ОЧЕНЬ раздражает.
  
  Пофикси разработчики всего эти две вещи и я бы рукоплескал игре.

  Мелочи, которые простить можно, но все-таки они как лишнее пятно:
  3. Почему убрали возможность командного взаимодействия? Больше нельзя подлечить конкретно союзника (таблетками, только когда он в агонии), больше нельзя передать патроны (а в RE5 это неплохо развивало взаимодействие), все предметы просто продублированы. Но это же кооперативная игра, а дублирование предметов наоборот делает игроков более самостоятельными, даже эмблемы каждый теперь сам сбивает для себя. Определиться бы - кооператив это или попутная прогулка?
  4. Где задачи на подумать? Даже в РЕ5 хотя бы были зеркала с лучами.
  5. Старая прокачка и выбор оружия были приятнее и вариативнее. Мне нравится настраивать под себя арсенал, а тут 3 скилла и будь доволен.

  Итого: Хороший и добротный продолжатель 4 и 5 частей. Кооператив добавляет игер лишний бал и можно честно поставить около 7 из 10. А так просто было вытянуть выше, всего лишь исправив перечисленные ошибки.",True

"I will include a tldr at the end for those that just want a brief review, but I'm first going to go over my thoughts about how the game was handled and the developers before reviewing the game itself.

I remember being one of those people that got very excited when the game was originally shown off at E3. I payed attention to most of the news that came out about the game and eagerly awaited its release. However, I didn't pre-order and instead waited for it to come out and to read some of the reviews. After the flood of negative reviews hit all across the internet, I ended up passing on the game in disappointment and forgetting about it for some time. 

I was surprised when I heard that the developers where still working on the game and adding new free content years after release; trying to improve the game and turn it into what everyone expected it to be on launch. This was about a year or so ago when I learned about the various improvements made, and I said to myself that if I felt that enough content was added, I would finally buy it. I ended up buying it during the steam summer sale for $30 (US), and I completed the main story and all of the side quests except for ""Dreams of the Deep"" before writing this review.

I am genuinely impressed by the work and dedication Hello Games has poured into this game. A game in which almost everyone denounced after launch, and nobody thought it would ever be improved or fixed. Hello Games have earned my respect for what they have done over the years following the release, and I want to say thank you. Thank you for your hard work and dedication towards making this game into something even better than what was expected, and I can't wait to see how this game will evolve in the years to come and what the next game will be from Hello Games.

Now onto my thoughts about the game itself. In short, it is a fairly solid game with some great ideas sprinkled throughout, but it is dragged down somewhat by some design decisions and bugs. Some of the aspects I thought were great was the language learning system, freighter/capital ships, various planet and space exploration mechanics, and some of the lore. I really like the fact that you have to learn alien languages before I can actually understand them. The main downfall of this is that you can only learn on word at a time and there are hundreds of words per species! I eventually gave up on learning a language after learning about 300 words for one species and realizing I might only be half way done learning it. This wouldn't have been a problem if you could do something like learn multiple words at once instead of one at a time, or require you to learn less words. I also really liked how freighters and capital ships acted as a mobile base with the ability to hire frigates to do expeditions. I ended up getting a class A capital ship with a fleet of frigates and constantly sending out expeditions to gather even more resources for me to hoard for story missions or sell instantly. The exploration was very good in the beginning but started declining after about 20 hours since I had discovered what I believe to be either all or most of the planet types (including the very strange/unique planets). It was nice to have a variety of places to explore ranging from inhabited and abandoned space stations/outposts, ancient ruins, and derelict freighters (in the most recent update as of the writing for this review). I also want to stress how I love the fact that you can explore basically anywhere which really makes you feel the scale of this game, and it make it feel like you are actually exploring even if it is only for a little while. However, due to the procedural generation nature of the game, many places start to look and act the same after some time and you stop exploring due to curiosity and start doing it purely for gaining resources. Lastly, I thought that they did some interesting this with the lore and background; specifically with the Korvax and Gek. Without spoiling anything, I want to say that their backgrounds and relationship was interesting and I can't recall off the top of my head another sci-fi story that had dome something like this. 

There are some significant flaws such as a general disappointment the rewards for the majority of the quests in the game. Most rewards don't feel big enough to compensate the amount of work that is required. The story is serviceable and predictable if you pay attention enough to the game environment and names of quests. The ending also feels somewhat anticlimactic, especially since the location used for the finally was also used in other parts of the game making it not feel like a unique and important place. The game isn't necessarily grindy, it just takes time to do some tasks such as finding specific resources. Lastly, the game is buggy in numerous places. I have had quests that got stuck in a reward loop giving me multiple copies of the same reward. My ship would do odd flips and spins when entering my capital ship sometimes. Textures not loading and/or clipping, and other smaller bugs popping their heads every now and again. None of them ever hurt my progress or caused crashes, they were just annoyances.

I will give this game a 3/5 for now with the potential to increase depending on how the game is updated in the future.

tldr;
3/5

You can create, explore, and destroy, and the only limit is your willingness to put forward the effort. This game allows you to be rather expressive with your imagination; given, this game shines as a co-operative game for dungeon crawling, fighting all sorts of beasties, and building massive strongholds. Definitely a bit more fantasy-action based than minecraft.

"Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is my favourite game of [i]all time[/i]. There. I said it. It is quite literally, the [i]perfect RTS[/i]. It effortlessly captures the massive scale of the war you're fighting by literally allowing up to 1500 units per player (in a high player-count game I've seen upwards of 18000 at once), and makes it so incredibly easy to manipulate your units, that you can bounce between the macro and micro scales as fast as you want, whenever you want. There's no bullshit 'morale' system, no bullshit 'squad' system, and no bullshit fullstop. It's pure, fast-thinking, and [i]perfect[/i]. On top of this game being fucking [i]brilliant[/i], it's one of the only two RTS games that aren't complete bollocks (the other being AoE:II) - reasons why below.

My main problem with other RTS games is unneccasery mechanics. Simply having more mechanics does not automatically make your game more meaningfully complex, and it just encourages a focus on micromanagement. Starcraft suffers from this terribly, and battles are determined by who can press the most buttons in the least amount of time. There's no [i] concious thought[/i] in that at all, and battles are never won on strategy - this [i]completely[/i] undermines the very idea of a 'real time [b]strategy[/b]' in the first place.

Further problems include the fact that if you have no resources in other games, you have to wait for your scout/miner/whateverthefuck to bring resources back to your base to build more units to back up your army, and if, say, you were in the middle of a battle, this is precious time lost, and it (once again) is down to whoever clicked first. SupCom's economy, however, is decided by more by map control (more map control gives more mass extractors, more mexes means more mass collected per tick) than who-clicked-on-a-pile-of-shit-first, and map control is decided by, you guessed it, whoever has the better tactics (or more units, but that must mean you've got a better economy, and as such have already demonstarted superior tactics).

None of this [i]even mentions[/i] the game's [i]nigh-flawless[/i] use of asymmetry within the factions. Each unit in the game has different capabilities based on the faction you're playing as, and each unit either has a strategy, or a unit that hard counters it. [i]It's a giant game of rock-paper-scissors, but it [b]actually benefits the game[/b][/i], because (unlike other asymmetrical games ([i]I'm looking at you, Overwatch...)[/i]) you can see exactly what's around the corner at any given time, and adjust your strategy accordingly. [i][b]This means the game is based purely on outsmarting your opponent.[/b][/i] No other RTS is like this. [b]That[/b] is exactly why Supreme Commander is a masterpeice.

The game is even still maintained by the community via FAF - Forged Alliance Forever - at faforever.com. Recently we got loading screen tips, because, why not, and it's updated frequently with various balance changes and the like. The community is great - I play with the GB clan - and they're the loveliest bunch of guys you're ever likely to meet (even though I haven't been active for a while).

Simply put, SupCom:FA is the closest game to pure real-time strategy ever made. There's no messing around. It's a fast-paced, rapid-fire, mental challenge, not a twitch game, and it is almost completely unique in that regard.

One of the BEST!!! You will keep playing again n again.,True
"This game was pretty fun, especially for a South Park fan. I spent 12 hours on this game and I found it to be rather easy, even when I put it in the highest difficulty. The RPG element and the graphics are spectacular. I really hope there's another South Park game that will come out soon, but 9 times out of 10, there probably wont.",True
"Elite Dangerous is an interesting game. It's a space flight sim where you spend a lot of your time completing tasks that sound dull on paper like delivering goods or messages from space station to space station with vast gulfs of space in between everything you see, with the occasional encounter with pirates, bounty hunting, or larger battles that are a far cry from what the trailers for this game depict in terms of combat. This is not an arcadey fast paced game and it isn't always that exciting but I think the appeal in it comes from something else. Everything in the game has intricately detailed weight and fine nuances within every detail. Your ship feels like a real thing that you own and the space in it becomes familiar and welcome. 

This comes out in little details like how the sound design lets you hear the strain your ship takes when it's under fire as each hit echoes through the hull, or when your control and display panels begin to spark and catch fire when it takes heat damage from flying too close to a star, or how you hear and see the ship ice over when you shut off all systems but life support and thrusters to lower your heat signature to avoid detection, or when the conopy gets damaged and cracks until it shatters taking your air with it into the void leaving you precious minutes  of air in your suit to get back to a station in the silence of a vacuum. Your ship feels like Your ship

That attention to detail also comes out in how the game moves at a measured and calm pace that allows you to appreciate the vastness of the Milky Way Galaxy. The distances are enormous between things and you feel that within those little details. When moving between destinations within a solar system or between two solar systems your hud will let you know what the distance is and how long it would take to reach at your current speed. It's interesting to note how when you're moving slowly it would take days or years to reach those locations without turning on your frame drive which allows you to travel at thousands of kilometers per second and even at those speeds it can still take a minute or two to to get where you want to go within your current star system, then to get to other star systems you have to move beyond the speed of light. The distances are enormous as they truelly are in the galaxy and you feel like you, your ship, and the things humans have built in this galaxy are the scale that they should be which is very small in comparison to everything else. Yet there's a kind of zen like calm that can come from flinging yourself across the stars as a tiny spec amidst the massiveness of it all. It's a subtle enjoyment that comes from the slow mastery of your ship's controls and realizing that every display serves a purpose and that you've grown to use them all like the tools they are. It's the relaxation that comes from gliding through the openess of space with complete control over your destination. It feels very free and much of the enjoyment in the game comes from those little moment to moment experiences that let you feel like a realistic part of that universe. 

This isn't a game where you're the hero of some massive galaxy spanning conflict out to save the universe. It's the story of who you would want to be if you could travel through space and the kind of stories that your experiences make that feel very personal and human. I've experienced coming out of faster than light travel into a star system only to discover that it doesn't even have a single small outpost and I that don't have enough fuel to get to a system that does because I didn't map my route properly. I've slowly and methodically tracked a bounty between two stars hunting and pursuing them until I finally corner them and take their ship apart piece by piece, I've donated money to help a space station make repairs, I've been a gun runner that got lucky when the security for the station I was heading for got distracted blowing up some other poor sod who did something foolish, while I snuck in with cargo bays full of very illegal weapons. I also felt kind of guilty about it afterwards as it increased crime in the station. I slowly mastered the delicate task that is docking your ship properly and in a timely manner. I put a rail gun on my ship and only realized once a fight had already begun that my ship only had power to fire the rail gun, or keep my engines going, not both. I then promptly got blown to bits in the middle of desperately trying to redirect the power in a vain hope that maybe I'd find some clever way to keep both modules powered. More than once I've just sat back and cruised through a star system until a whim to do one thing or another strikes me. My experiences from this game are very much on a human scale with the concerns and activites a pilot might actually undertake. It feels grounded which lends everything a certain layer of believability and increased engagement, You don't feel like you have to be the chosen one born to be the hero pilot of an infinite empire. You feel like who you would be as a pilot within this universe.

Now to be fair many of the complaints people have made about the game are fair.The tasks you get hired for, or that are available aren't that varried structure wise. To me that feels realistic as these are jobs that someone hires you for or that you take on as a pilot not quests of salvation that only a hero can complete. I realize though that to others the lack of variety may feel boring. It's also true that planned updates like being able to get out of your ship and wander around stations or land on planets haven't been made and no one knows when they'll be made if at all. So you'll spend the whole game in your ship. I admit I would really like to get out and experience the stations and their residents rather than interacting with it solely through a menu and seeing the state of the station in stats and text. Exploring the planets that are out there in full scale detail would be great as well as getting out of your ship to do repairs or board other ships and do fps combat type stuff. Realistically though those are huge things to develop so either they're going to take time to make or they won't be practical to make and the developers will have to go back on their word. That's not great, but if you can move past those perfectly reasonable expectations I think you may find that the core of the game is still a worthwhile experience that stands on its own. 

For people who are thinking about getting this game I would advise that in my experience this is a game that isn't really about spectacle, adrenaline, and lots of heart pounding excitement. It's a game about creating a deep experience that is very personal to you that will move at a gradual pace. For me it's meditative in nature and lets me relax, explore, and create my own stories. It's also a game where I can see that a lot of love and care has gone into making it. Also despite being an mmo the multiplayer isn't the main focus and is somewhat limited. I like playing the game solo but it's something to consider if the multiplayer is important to you. Everything else is pretty much a space pilot sim that encourages freedom and introspection. Oh and it has a steep learning curve with more than a few things that aren't explained in full. I found that most could be figured out by just exploring the menus and checking what the control binding were but some may require a guide or explanation. A couple are that all of the displays and menus in your ship are practical and are used for something and free look is great for navigating those menus and taking in the sights. If you're using a keyboard and mouse I also suggest looking at one of the previouse reviews by Hetzer that has an excellent alternate key binding set up as the default one is clumsy.",True

Really Good game like the graphics Fun and enjoyable,True
"After fully playing this game, it's safe to say I loved it! I love the artstyle, the gameplay, the storylines, the characters, the slightly different interactions you get depending on how drunk you get them and the replayability. 

Everyday you encounter a variety of people who tell you their story and the more you serve them the more you get to know them; their favorite drink, and their least favorite drink which helps you move their story along. I also like the little things of purchasing things for your room as well as the scattered cut scenes. I loved all the different endings and once I played through the game enough times to believe I have unlocked every ending and voiceline I was left wanting more. 

I hope there would be more beautifully created and engaging games such as VA-11 HALL-A in the future and I would highly recommend this game for those that are looking for a story-filled game that doesn't cease to put a smile on your face while you mix drinks and nod your head to the jams!",True

"Rapture, impossible rapture.  I played the original Bioshock when it came out and I wasn't quite as impressed as everyone told me I should be.  Consequently I hung back on playing the sequel.  Well, if you haven't played it I suggest you go ahead because I think it is a thoroughly enjoyable game.

One of Bioshock's strengths was the emergent combat - attach ten proximity mines to a gas cylinder and throw it at a big daddy to kill it in one go?  Give it a try, see if you can reach him before someone shoots the cylinder while you're still holding it.  The mechanics in the new game just improve your range of options, you are allowed to wield a gun in one hand and a plasmid in the other. allowing you to string together some slick combos even for the 'all thumbs' gamer like me.  The selection of weapons is more interesting including a spear gun which can carry your enemy across the room and pin it to a wall like a rag doll.  That takes a long time to grow old.  Upgrading your weapons and plasmids adds interesting additional effects and widens the range of options.  Shoot someone with a hot rivet equipped rivet gun to set them on fire, they will run to a pool of water to extinguish the flames where you can then electrocute them in water.  It's a violent playground for the maladjusted.

Also in the new features section is your character's ability to use the Little Sisters to harvest Adam for you.  While they are harvesting you have to protect them from harm.  You have the opportunity to set up defences before the harvest commences - turrets, mines, traps and so on.  You will need to because as soon as the Little Sister starts harvesting every splicer in the area will come to grab some of the action.  There is a bit of double jeopardy involved because you can't be certain how much interest the harvest will attract.  You might need to defend against five splicers or fifteen or more, so how much of your equipment your use up is a bit of a gamble.

The environment is more decrepit than ever and as unlikely as ever.  An art deco greenhouse at the bottom of the sea, it isn't possible but you so want it to be.  That is the magic of it - I know enough about physics to know it cannot be done but I so want it to exist because it is wondrous.  Even though it is now very leaky.  The levels are large and complex and convey the continuing deterioration of the city very well.  The desingers have leavened it with enough unspoiled locations to show you what is was like, which serves to make the rest of it seem so sad.

The story doesn't have the twistiness of the first game but it is less jarring.  The main antagonist is not so compelling as Ryan from first game but Ryan still exists on the log files.  The log files you find also manage to convey the smaller stories within the dirty schemes whilst mixing in a simple conversation about the masses versus the self.  All the voice acting is good, some if it very good.  I could listen to the man who plays Ryan read the telephone directory.  You are able to influence the feel of the story a bit more with decisions you take all the way through the game.  Not by much but what there is, is pleasantly satisfying.

So overall I think it is a good way to spend forty hours - I am slow so your mileage may vary.  It is a melancholy game, in a great location with good, tense gameplay that is not too soft on you but equally doesn't leave you chewing your keyboard in frustration.",True
