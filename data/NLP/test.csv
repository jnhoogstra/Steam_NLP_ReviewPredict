HEY THAT'S PRETTY GOOD!,True
GREAT,True
"This game, this game right here is really, really awesome! It's like playing with legos, on the computer, and you don't have to buy the said legos. This game is what I have played a lot, just like another game I've played a lot. If you love legos, and are too lazy to get the money to buy real legos, then this game is for you. And one of the awesome things is that you can host your own server if you wanted, and addons are really easy to install. I recommend this game to people who have someform of creativity and loves legos. Just becarful when exploring the server list, there are some strange servers out there... not saying all of the servers are bad, just some of those servers could cause you to lose your sanity being there. I happen to host a server, though I don't get very many players thanks to certaint people who shan't be named for reasons that I will not tell you about. Though there can be some downsides to this game, it tends to cause weaker computers to crash, which is annoying since I have a horrable computer, but if you know what you're doing, and keep the addon count small, you'll be fine with hosting a server, and don't be afraid to ban people, they break the rules on your server, so it gives you the full right to ban them. And there are other people who complan about how bad the server is, and here's a little tip when dealing with them, simply tell them this ""My server, my rules. If you got a problem with this, then get off of my server."" and then ban them if they do not stop, and if you don't want them returning day after day, calling you some very rude, and stupid, names, then perma ban them, like I said, it's your server, you decide how it works, if people don't like it, then they don't like it. You can't change that. And be sure to be a very kind person so people like you, if you do that, more and more people will show up on your server. These are my words of wisdom for hosting a server, I'd share my wisdom on how to not be banned on other servers within five seconds, but I do not have time for that today. Good luck, my good people, you're going to need it. Also, check out my some of my guides for Blockland, I only have one at the moment, but feel free to check them out!",True
"I really enjoy this game i played with a friend and it's fun being a 3rd person zombie game.

pros:
multiplayer
strategy game (have to think how to place barricades)
graphics are not stressful meaning you can play it on a ""bad"" pc
cheap

cons:
zombies i think need to be nerfed in rounds above 17
turrents don't do anything i could tell
edit: was a noob didn't notice could mount guns to turrents, if you don't have turrents you won't last.

Suggestions:
add more obstacles, barricades, weapons
add doors so that we don't have to make a plus sign
shape to get in and out of the barricades

overall a really good game please buy it to support the creators and hopefully they can make an awesome game amazing :D
graphics: 7/10
gameplay: 9/10
storyline: no storyline needed
simplicity: 7/10 i say this because you have to make a gameplan and experiment what is best (makes gameplay better)
difficulty:2/10 rounds 1-10 9/10 10-...

I would recommend this for a game to play when you are bored or have one-two friends online 
it's okay to play alone but it adds to the aspect of surviving with friends.

Overall grade: 9/10",True
"I've never written a review for a game before.

This game is a buggy mess. Constant connection issues and definitely not on my end (after hours and hours of research and troubleshooting) losing the bounty, and on a couple of a occasions a double bounty, because of this, and losing high level hunters to the same issue because ""you were in combat when this happened"".

Creatures will spawn on top of you from time to time, though this is rare and frankly, most mobs are pretty easy to take down. Though the distraction and noise of such an event will usually cause you to die from enemy players and teams.

I can run this game on maximum settings at 120+ fps and my ping never goes above 40, even on my secondary server which is Russia.
I'm more than willing to accept responsibility on my end for connection issues and hardware/software issues. After spending a great deal of time to figure out the source of these problems, I've discovered there is nothing more I can do on my end.

Unfortunately I played this game for far more hours than any refund will allow, largely because I was really interested in the premise and adore the atmosphere. However the stealth aspect is a bit lacking, you can occasionally creep up and get the drop on an enemy player(s). But very often the combat devolves into a very arcade-feeling shootout.

Every so often I'll have a really good duel against some good players and I have really enjoyed those moments, but they are few and far between.
Because of the long loading times, I also find myself waiting...a long time, usually for other people to load into the map as my pc is more than capable of running this game with ease. This, coupled with the near-constant connection issues, makes for an extremely unenjoyable experience. There's no point attempting to enjoy the occasional ""all-in"" load out with good weapons, since the chance you will just lose all that money and effort to some random disconnect is too high to risk.

This means that unless you are one of those lucky few without any connection issues, you will never get to experience even 1/5 of the weapons and playstyles available. Because you will need to constantly watch your money due to losing it through these unavoidable problems. I've still managed to get around 11800 odd of the hunt dollars, through sheer persistence, but it dwindles down extremely quickly once you have a bad spate of connection issues.

The game just isn't consistent enough to warrant enjoyment and I'm extremely disappointed. I'm happy for anyone who hasn't had these issues, but for now, it will be uninstalled and ignored for the foreseeable future.",False

"For the price, this game offers a good 4-6 hours of detective work. It shares some mechanics to Frogwares' Sherlock series with the observations and deduction screens. The art style, while I was not fond of at all, started to really grow on me. The plot is interesting enough to keep you engaged. Also a nice touch is the multiple dialogue options which do not offer total freedom (ie you're always steered onto the right track and cannot fail), but you can still make some mistakes, some absolutely dire! 

For the price tag, this game is a strong recommendation of mine for fans of detective games.",True

"This is my favorite game on Steam. I have played it since the Fall of 2017 and got to experience the Waking The Tiger, Man the Guns, and La Resistance DLCs as they came out. This game is so awesome. I have found nothing more thrilling in video games as playing as Germany and trying to crush the Comintern and the Allies before America joins into the fight. If you buy this game, you won't regret it. The learning curve is extremely steep but the difficulty makes the mastery of strategy wholly worthwhile. This game inspired me to change my course in college and focused me down the road into the legal profession with a minor in programming. This game has changed my life path and I hope everyone at Paradox is proud of their work here. Thanks you guys.",True

""And all these stories we've been telling each other? Just that. Stories...""

What is “Her Story”?
Is it a Puzzle Game?
Is it an Interactive Movie?
 
Her Story is a crossbreed between a simple Puzzle game and an interactive movie.
The “gameplay” revolves around listening to the woman in the clips and based on what she says, you have to type in keywords or -phrases to find more clips.
There is no clear objective at first, you are only presented with a search engine and your first keyword: “MURDER”.
You press enter and listen to the first few statements.
Rather quickly you’ll realize that your goal is to find out what happened to a guy named Simon.

About 2 hours later you know the answer to that question.

To call the game “minimalistic” would be quite the understatement.
So, you shouldn’t ask “WHAT is Her story”, but “WHY is Her Story”.
WHY is Her Story a good game?

It’s the way the story is presented.
You do not experience the story from start to finish, like almost any other story, be it a game, a book or a movie.
Each of the 200 statements (ranging in length from 2 seconds to about 1:30 minutes) has its own clip and because you search only for keywords and -phrases, the order in which you view them is completely mixed up.
Also, you are limited to the first 5 clips (in chronological order) that come up for that particular keyword.
That means if you search for “Simon”, you get 61 results, but can only view the first 5, so you always have to dig for more keywords.
Soon you will be trying to figure out who everybody is, establish the timeline and following multiple leads.

Since you do not unlock the clips in any specific order, nothing stops you from just trying out random words.
Or better, come to your own conclusions and try a word that you might not have heard yet, but think might have some significance.
You’ll be surprised how often this works and when it does, boy does it feel rewarding.

In conclusion I’d say “Her Story” is more of a story-telling experiment than an actual game, but I look forward to other games that evolve this principle.",True

"Gameplay consists of joining a multiplayer server, each with different game modes. Free for all, Team Deathmatch, Team objectives, etc. All of them are really quite fun. Albeit, there isn't a large selection of maps to play. For some, the combat mechanics of the game might be a little slow. i.e. swinging your sword can take a short time, and gives your enemy sufficient time to lunge in at you and kill you. It's made so that you can engage your foe in a fair dodge/parry/lunge swordfight. Now just imagine 32 vs 32 doing it at the same time, and a couple archers on the sidelines. That's Chivalry.",True

"[h1]This game gave Witcher 3 a good run for its money in the story department[/h1]
I haven't been able to like another story driven game since playing Witcher 3 because it ruined all other games for me but Life is Strange changed that.
This game hit me right in the feels. It also had me guessing what would happen all the time. I just had to know how it was all going to end. That is why I stayed up till 4 am just to finish it even though I had work at 10:45.

"I wanted to like this game but EEEUUUuuurrRrrRGGGGHHG!

The updated graphics and most of the gameplay is pretty good but the glitchy controls have just made it unplayable for me. 

Hold grab while jumping, sometimes she will grab the ledge sometimes she won't, depends on her mood I guess. You can spend an hour trying to figure out how to do a jump only to die over and over to realise that even though you do the EXACT same thing each time she will only make it 2/10 attempts. 

I hit breaking point and just unistalled it as it got to the point where it wasn't seen as 'challenging' but actually seen as broken..

Moved onto Underworld and I'm 15 minutes into it and it already feels like it has superior controls and is less temperamental.",False
"Though I suck at it, Frostpunk is extremely engaging, incredibly fun, but challenging enough to keep you on your toes. The main story scenarios are where the best parts of the game as they give you loads to do and with different conditions, such as clearing burned down houses or keeping heating up on certain buildings. My only gripe is that at a certain point in endless mode, you do not have anything left to do, such as research, and sending scouts out can get kinda tiresome waiting for them to get materials and make their way back to the city. Overall, this game is great in the scenarios and the early stages of endless mode.

"Don't play this game if you have important things to do. I've been playing this game non-stop since I purchased it.

"Very great game, can lose hours just playing in it. You need a very strong PC to be able to enjoy this properly, however. Also have not really played the online PVP or PVE as I hear bad things about them. I stick to single player and non-dedicated servers where 3 of your friends can join you in a private game.",True
"You are Lucius Wagner, a 6 going on 7 year old demonic boy. Your goal is to kill your family and everyone inside your mansion. Your father is running for senate, but with all the death going on inside his home, he fears he will lose. Nobody suspects that a 6-7 year old boy has the capability of commiting over 15 murders.

The game took me about 8.5 hours to beat and get 56 of the 58 achievements, the two I didnt get being the ""Play 20 Hours"" and the ""Play 40 Hours"" achievements. It was fun while it lasted, but paying $20 for a game that took 8 hours to beat seems a little overpriced. It has a good story, and its extremely fun and intriguing, but I wish it lasted a bit longer. It would be worth every penny if it was only $10.

"simple, 2d, fun.",True
"Talking about dead by daylight, we are talking about a unique game. A unique, fun, infuriating and soemtimes crazy driving game. First of all, the game in general is fun, and the whole idea of things happening in it is nice...BUT. If only they would have done that ""PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR"" better, the game would have been way more enjoyable to play. All in all, we have facecamping, bodyblocking, getting stuck in the trees, searching a game for 30 minutes and then getting kicked and many more problems. In average, i could say the game is pretty balanced, though some killers seem like cancer to play against, but maybe its just me... Now i know what most people think though: ""Ban the facecampers!Hooray bodyblockers"", but thats just 1 side of the coin. On the other one, both should be fixed. Facecamping is not realistic, not fair and all, but think about bodyblocking. It just sounds stupid aswell. A giant human is not able to step over ot push a small crouching dwight away?Really?That always wondered me. Now, talking about the community, its pretty nice. I mean...Comparing it to CSGO salty russian community, this seems like heaven...Killers complain about all the palletlooping stuff and such like infinite, but i would say this is normal, this is after all just a survivor, whom can only run, and its up to him, how to do that, you are the killing machine here. Ranking system...Oh well, how many times have i gotten rank 20 killers/survivors, when im rank 4(both survivor and killer) myself. 
         Here is my conclusion: the game is good and fun, but could have been better if devs fix all those annoying bugs and facecamping/bodyblocking... So far, i give Dead by daylight a 7/10 and i hope it gets better with devs working.

"So it's been a long time since this game released, yet it's still getting DLC/updates all the time.

I'm a huge Elder Scrolls and Bethesda fan and I've spent hours playing all of their games. The way this plays is pretty close to the single player ES games, but with PLENTY of multiplayer additions.

I never thought I'd be interested in a video game economy, but finding rare items to sell is such an awesome feeling. There's a huge marketplace with literally any item you could ever need, and sometimes people just sell stuff for 99% off for literally no reason but to help players.

This game is FULL of seasoned players that are more than happy to help new players too. I've had multiple people give me full sets of armor/gold/teach me how to fight/build better characters.

There's also a ridiculous amount of lore and RP elements too. Like, a lot. You could spend months reading in-game books/talking to NPCs/doing story quests just to enjoy the lore.

Would recommend for <$10

Pros:
- A soundtrack (4 amazing songs) you can unlock, download, and keep (DRM free) (Big fucking plus that no other games have done for free and at such a low price point)
- Fun selection of insults to listen through
- Everything that's good from the original FC3
- You get to feel like you're actually all out of bubble gum and ready to kick some ass
- LAZORS PEW PEW, BITCH
- Game has similar gameplay aspects to the original FC3
- Game has completely different story line from original FC3, however it's not nearly as deep

Cons:
- Story isn't longer (beatable in ~7 hours)
- Wish there was more soundtracks to unlock & download

Walking down the road you hear some bellowing cry of intense pain. You walk over some bushes on a hill to investigate the matter a bit more to only find out it was a Blood Dragon consuming a scientist, just the average day in this pink misted hell. Suddenly this soldier from the Daft Punk regime starts pew pewing at you with his laser rifle. Quickly, you take your Fazertron and turn his head into swiss cheese within 2 left clicks. The Blood Dragon is quickly drawn to you, so you swap to your Kobracon rifle and start unloading it in it's general direction. It's doing almost nothing so you draw out your Terror 4000 and rip it's, and everything around it's, sorry ass in half.

"Going in on a whim to get this game, didn't participate in the kickstarter, I only saw a few videos so I didn't know how it'd go.  What I came into was annoying stress situations, downs and ups (if lucky) if your units overstress, constant status ailments, constantly needing to make sure your lights up, planning items to bring in without over or understocking, dealing with the constant positioning of the units, it is all a hard hassal where your units have a very high chance, of dying. Meaning all the progress and equips on them, will be lost the minute they die, no redos. It's all such a major progress for small progressing rewards........and I loved it.

All of this stress, this pressure, this thought you need to put into the game is what makes it great.  It helps you strategize, who to bring with on an expidition, how they're going to cooperate with each other, making sure your supplies are exactly right, planning your funds and keeping stress underlined while going through gridded dungeons with turn based combat, it's all a fun adventure in a depressing setting.  All the while, every action is directed by a brilliantly voiced narrator. A dark, graggly voice telling your story as if he's in control of it all.  The music is brooding and quiet to fit the mood, and there's many units that can join your barracks ranging from healers, to paladins, to jesters, to valkyries (names may vary) all of which carry their own baggage.  Each unit always holds their certain pros and cons, between phobias and dungeon experience.  And there's even mild town building after each dungeon for every time you return, you'll more then likely bring relics with to help build up the town for your own better.  Buildings to help increase a units skill, weapon, armor, lose a negative trait, lose stress (yes it carries over) it's all such a good variety, especially for early access.

  It's really hard to find a negative, though I do find myself needing the usual break every now and then.  If anything, and this is a big anything, your stress can go up really fast in the wrong setting, and this will put you in a big hole. but this is countered by the fact that sometimes....all that stress isn't bad, though it usually is. Another negative is that...sometimes the characters talk a little too much amongst each other, where it'll be a while before the turn continues, especially after a stress upset. It's nice seeing character interaction and all...but mid battle and each character giving stressed dialouge, it gets a lil tedious. And this game is not recommened for those who hate permadeth. All this said, it has me excited to how the game will update as it's built.

  I'd defiently give this a 9/10, not perfect, but still great.",True

"[h1]You’re better off playing Abzu. [/h1]

Flower is a relaxing exploration game originally developed for the Playstation by thatgamecompany. You play as a gust of wind, blooming flowers by flying over them and collecting their petals. As you bloom flowers, you breathe new life into the world around you. 

I was quite looking forward to Flower going into it, having recently enjoyed Abzu, but my initial enjoyment of the game was quickly replaced with disappointment. And in fact, I’ve had to stop playing the game because it has caused me motion sickness, which is something I almost never experience with games. If you’re interested in playing this, you’re much better off playing it on the PS3/4 as the issues with the game stem from it being a poor port. 

[h1]Positives: [/h1]
[list][*]It is a beautiful game. The world design is fairly minimalistic but I thought that was a good decision here, it makes it feel more peaceful.

[*]The music is lovely, very relaxing. [/list]

[h1]Negatives: [/h1]
[list][*]Flower’s biggest problem is that the controls are not good. For a game in which all you do is move, controls are really important and the controls here are so bad that it makes anything after the first level frustrating to play. You frequently have to fly around in a circle or make precise movements while travelling quickly to get all the flowers that are lined up, and I’ve found that the controls just aren’t responsive enough to get this done. In fact, it just isn’t responsive enough in general, trying to turn around is a clunky affair. I also found it frustrating that you’re either stationary or boosting and coming to a stop is very janky. These issues seem to come from the fact that the game was originally developed for six-axis controls, and they just didn’t do a good job porting the game to a different method of controls. I imagine that M+KB is even worse. 

[*]Speaking of travelling quickly, I found that the movement speed was just too fast. You really zip around quite quickly, seemingly faster the more petals you’ve accumulated, and I found that I was going so fast that I was easily missing flowers because I either didn’t see them or I was just going too fast to get close to them. Seeing as the controls are so poor, circling back to get flowers you missed because you were going too fast is really rather frustrating. 

[*]The final nail in the coffin for me was the fact that it just doesn’t run smoothly. I did check to make sure that I was running at a constant 60FPS, and I was, but oftentimes it felt like the game was running at sub-30. No doubt this contributed to the rare motion sickness I experienced. [/list]

[h1]Verdict: [/h1]

Flower is a beautiful game that’s made to be rather unpleasant due to it being a poor port. Bad controls in a game heavily focused on movement is quite the issue, and it doesn’t run smoothly either. Unless you have a Playstation you can try it on instead, you’re better off avoiding this one.

You guys need to fix your agro system. Its really bad,True
"THIS REVIEW IS AN EDIT:


Dayz is a game with uncanny potential. It's a game that flung the whole ""open world, your choice, zombie survival"" theme into orbit. This game, in over 3 years of development could be the perfect survival game but the devs just can't get it right. It is overloaded with bugs and is lacking in content aside from grab gun and kill as much peopel as you can. Frankly, it's sad to see a game like this wasting away with so much unused potential.",False
"Compared to the joke Elite Dangerous, they actually took good care of the license with this game. I'm not going to mention the overpriced DLCs since you don't need them. At all.

On the plus side is the fact that I think they have kept true to the feeling of the movies. Not perhaps so much the first one, but the sequels. The music fits perfectly and the dinos looks terrific. The managment part of it is not very deep, but I kind of like that in this game since it allows me to focus on other things like watching a Raptor eat a goat. Never gets old. 
They also seem to have optimised the game fairly well and unless I have a huge park with tons of dinos and guests, I get no framedrops at all. The dino AI hasn't really bugged out on me yet as well. There are some collision problems now and then but I think overall it's not bad at all.

However, there are some negative sides:

1. The slapped on overthetop idiots that you have to listen to. Yes, I'm referring to the Entertainment and Security divisions. I just have one question: WHY???

2. Terrain restrictions makes it incredibly annoying to build. One little rock in the way? Nope! You can't build here!

3. I've also only encountered one bug (a rather bad one though..) and that is that the game crashes when you try to change from borderless windowed mode to full screen. NO, FRONTIER! I don't want to waste computing resources on having the GPU to update Aero and other things in the background. How can you not have fixed this? *sigh*

4. It's rather annoying as well that the game pushes you to leave the islands after a while. Until you have finished the tasks you are supposed to, the dinos behave fairly well. However, if you try to grind a bit, you will do nothing but having your ACU to tranquilise dinos after they have wrecked a fence for the 10th time in the same amount of minutes. And this only gets worse and worse when you try to polish your themepark. I like to try to perfect each one before I move on, but sadly the game really punishes you for playing like that.

5. The ""contracts"" (whatever that means in this game..) is very repetitive as well. Make your park generate 15000 USD per minute.. then 20000 USD.. you get the picture. There are some nice quests (spoiler alert) where you e.g. have to cure some dinos with an unknown decease but they are pretty few and far between. It's mostly braindead mindless grinding missions.. Oh, sorry.. contracts. My bad.

Overall, at this price it's worth it. I think the DLCs are overpriced (read A LOT!) but at 13 something Euros for the base game it's a fair price. It's rather sad though that they can't fix these easy things that annoyes the !32%£%^ out of me because it would raise it from a good game to a great one. And like I said, I have enjoyed the game so far.

The ""story"" isn't interesting enough to make me slog through the levels, and I can't completely stand by a game [i]just[/i] for its soundtrack. In my opinion, a game should have challenging, yet fun, fair, and rewarding gameplay. Crypt of the NecroDancer's gameplay is pretty unfair in its random room generation and crazy enemies, and when you combine that with the rhythm action mechanic, it ends up turning the combat into a tedious, time-consuming, unrewarding experience very quickly.",False

"Firstly, I was very afraid of this game, as I didn't knew anything about story, characters and etc. But ""Telltale Games"" studio showed me, that they can make a good, rich story game once more. I was enjoying this game as much as Walking Dead. If you like Walking Dead, Tales from Borderlands or Game of Thrones, buy this masterpiece at once. You won't regret it.",True
"On the whole, this game is pretty charming and enjoyable. Dialogue is constantly goofy and humourous, and while trying to keep track of however many different small details and questlines can be annoying, the game feels overall pretty satisfying and fun. While the combat and character building itself isn't especially deep, there's enough depth there for interesting and deliberate choices, and works to taxi the game from joke to joke. The game is reliable funny and hard to predict, and definitely carries a lot of quirky, silly charm.

My negative recommendation comes almost entirely from technical issues. This is a game that feels like it's being held together with chewing gum and good intentions. Getting the game to properly even recognize key bindings and resolution settings took me jumping into multiple places in the game's files, and the game still crashes on occasion.  The mouse pointer stands about a 50/50 chance of being invisible on startup (which more or less makes the game unplayable), and the only solution I've found is to alt tab out, and back in. The problem being is that alt tabbing out stands about a 50/50 chance of locking the game and the entire desktop, with the only solution being a system restart. Stack that on top of the mouse pointer sometimes disappearing upon loading out of a combat encounter, and you can see how it becomes more and more frustrating.

While I still quite enjoyed the game while I was able to play it, I've quit less than halfway through when my savefile was corrupted for the SIXTH time, and this time, I was unable to go into the game's .json files and recover a previous one. I've lost about seven hours of gameplay, and no longer have any motivation to continue.

TL;DR - The game itself is good, but the structure holding it up and trying to make it run definitely isn't.",False

"This game is EXTREMELY fun! However, there is not a lot of official content. 

- I also have a problem with the base button layout, and how some buttons have multiple functions (Drop weapon == pickup physics objects). 

- There is way too much time for the slow motion feature.

- The physics in the game are extremely slippery, so jumping up some crates can be challenging. 

- The sensitivity is a little bit odd.

- The menus are sort of janky/unorganized.

- Heads don't pop like fucking balloons when shot with shotguns.

- No limit on grenades. 

- Switching weapons is interesting, as holding a weapon removes it from the slot.

"I rate Osmos 4/5. Good...

...but this game can quickly become frustrating and is extremely difficult. Indeed, I remember an old ""friendlyware"" dos-based lunar lander game I had which sought to have fairly realistic controls. This is harder than that game ever was. In this game you control some sort of microscopic super-organism (I always pretend it's some sort of genetically engineered thing) and generally try to make it become the biggest creature in the petri dish (or microscope slide rather). You control it by ejecting parts of itself out in particular directions. Hence moving makes you smaller. You consume any other creatures (well most other creatures) which are also smaller than you are (bump into them to consume them) to get bigger (In a way it reminds me of that old Mortal Engines young adult book except there it was entire cities, not micro-organisms). The bigger you are the more you need to eject to move or even change direction. This dynamic quickly gets really complicated and challenging because you have to balance your need to move (both to hunt and to avoid danger) with your need to consume. I admit the game is now too hard for me to win (I'd have to be totally obsessed with this game to even try at this point) but despite this I still had a lot of fun getting to this point along the way. This game has peaceful, relaxing music and has a great visual athstetic. This is certainly one of the best, though one of the hardest, puzzle games I have ever played.",True

Mission: Whistleblower 

At the end of the mission, you may end up fighting two factions. If you move away from them so that they fight each other, the game can get stuck on ""Enemy Turn"". Left it there for half an hour before giving up and restarting.

Also, transition between realtime and combat mode has a bizarre wait time on it. After engaging combat mode, guards continue to walk for 10+ seconds, even pausing and resuming their walk, and can ""ambush"" you while you helplessly wait for combat mode to engage.

Mission: Uninvited Guests

At the end of the mission, there is a door to the escape vehicle. You can break this door directly by having a character ""work on it"" for a few rounds. Alternatively, there's a jack-in point around the side, which has some additional paydata. But, if you (1) break the door directly, then (2) jack in to grab the paydata, then (3) your decker gets wiped out in the matrix, you don't just get a stunned decker.

"The only way I recommend this game is if you are a die-hard Naruto fan (have watched/read/played the story up to this point) and have either played previous games in this series before or are up for a bit of reading and experimenting with controls.

That said, here are the reasons I do not recommend this game to everyone else:

NS:UNS3FB (even as a acronym it's a mouthful) is a fighting game with three modes: Story, which picks up around book 50 of the Naruto manga, after the attack on Konoha (um, the second one) and goes to the heat of the Fourth Great Ninja War. From what I have heard, the game actually makes up its own ending to this, which will probably cause confusion when the fourth game in the series comes around, but I'm not concerned with that.

See, this game is not a game for beginners, and this is my greatest beef with it. There are no tutorials in story mode. There are just about 25 dialogue boxes that display tips for the game - and you can't even access the start menu to view them until after the first few battles! So yes, if you haven't played the previous games (which are not on Steam currently) prepare to experiment a bit. Even then, you may get the feeling of missing out on things, watering down the experience. As I understand the battle system right now, it's only okay. There are items you can use... but that's not really my play style. Plus there are a TON of them to unlock, so I just ignore them completely. I've never needed any of them yet.

This brand of xenophobia towards newbies continues with the story itself. No explanations are given for past events, nor is any glossary given for the Naruto lexicon that has built up over the past 10+ years. There is a timeline that allows you to view key events from before the game, but I am halfway into story mode and have not yet unlocked a single one of those events.

And the cutscenes. Yikes. I haven't compared them, but the story mode likely covers most, if not all scenes from the manga. This means a lot of content, nearly all voiced and paced accordingly. The story has its moments, yes (Naruto meeting his mother in Chapter 4 had me tear up, honestly), but you will come to realize quickly that you will spend around 4/5ths of your time in story mode watching cutscenes and the rest actually controlling your character. It gives Final Fantasy VII: Dirge of Cerberus a run for its money. Each chapter roughly consists of about 5 1-3 minute stages... and then an hour's worth of scenes. This is odd. Other Naruto games have managed story better - I'm thinking of the early Clash of Ninjas, and maybe even the original Ultimate Ninja games, although I remember those less. I've finally wised up and started skipping scenes.

There is an overworld, or should I say a collection of straight paths which try to resemble an overworld. Besides Konoha, which you only spend a bit of time in, the overworld portions seem pointless, and are basically only hubs in which to shop and save your game before going to your next fight - menus could have done them equally as well.

There are thousands of collectibles to buy, but most of these are titles and still images you can use to spruce up your ninja info card for online play. Unless you are a absolutely hardcore completionist, you'll probably just buy the ones you want and get on with it. If you can find them - ever try navigating a drop-down style menu with 1000 options? You're going to.

The second mode is simply free battle. It's straightforward. Naruto Shippuden has a large roster (around 100 off the top of my head), and you'll probably find your favorites here. Many have alternate costumes/forms which may or may not be considered separate characters. Most of the characters have to be unlocked from story mode, though. For Full Burst there is also a 100-mission mission mode. I've heard gripes that not every character from Story mode is playable, but with a good-sized roster already, I have no problem with that.

The third mode is online play. I have not tested this, but I assume it plays more or less akin to Free Battle. With other people. And there's rankings.

I remember seeing a screenshot in a magazine for the first Storm game long ago and being blown away by how true to the anime it looked. Here, backgrounds look good, but character outlines ruin the setup a bit, I think. Still decent, though.

"It's a pretty fun and interesting game. Takes awhile to learn the basics of the game, but once you learn them you should be good. Only problem i had was there were some toxic people who would get mad at you for doing bad and kick vote to kick you. This happened to me often when i started playing it. Another problem is there are some hackers even in level Premium. Other than that the game is lots of fun. I don't recommend you to get into skins or knives cause you will waste a lot of money on them trust me. But skins also make you win games, so there's that. Keep telling yourself that the knife you bought will go up and you will make profit. So yeah that's all i have for this review. Other than wanting to die",True

The puzzles don't flow well in this game, it's a lot of backwards and forwards to find the answer. I found myself having to use a guide here and there, it broke from the immersion of the actual game.

"I already read Higurashi when they cry with its first translation provided by Mangagamer. It was also the very first Visual Novel I read (It's advertised as a sound novel yet I prefer the ""Visual"" Term), so I might not be very objective here, let's be honest, Higurashi will always have a special place in my heart ^^. Here's my review :

If you watched the well-known anime adaptation and are wondering if the source material is worth it, i'll advise you to give a shot to this first chapter, you'll find soon enough that the anime had its way of treating the original story. The anime version played a lot on the shock value and the more gruesome aspects of the VN, whereas the original story actually take time to build up its atmosphere, its characters, and the pace is slow on purpose. All of this to create tension and inducing paranoia. The infamous scenes everyone remembers represents only a minor percentage of the text. Onikakushi is one of the weakest arc on anime, yet it's a strong beginning in the VN serie. Try this first chapter for yourself and see if you like Ryukishi07's writing, if you don't, that's fine, Onikakushi works pretty well as a stand-alone title.

Now for those who came across this title for the first time, let's summarize it.Higurashi is a 8 chapters serie (as of  this review, only the last one has yet to be available) released between 2002 and 2006 created by 7th Expansion, written by Ryukishi07. In this story happening in the rural town of Hinamizawa, we follow the life of Keiichi Maebara, a young transfer student who quickly makes friends with girls of his school : Rena Ryuguu, Mion Sonozaki, Satoko Houjou and Rika Furude. Together they play various game after class and are having fun everyday. However, strange things begin to happen around Keiichi, and what's more strange, his friends could be involved...

To summarize more of Higurashi's plot would be a crime, so I'll refrain from doing that. This story is Ryukishi07's first work and I expected rereading it after going trough so many quality VNs that I'll find it less memorable than at this time. But no, it's still engaging even knowing the full story. Sure, some descriptions are too precise and slow down the pace, sure, there are repetitions. But despite that, the atmosphere woven, this sense of dread and tension growing in your body as you read at night and the plot itself, all of this merge together to produce a formidable impression on the reader. Onikakushi, this first chapter, is particularly strong on that regard : you'll feel like Keiichi feels. You will laugh with him and you will be scared with him. For a first work, I really think Ryukishi07 did a really good job with his writing and with setting his little universe. Sure, it's no Umineko Chiru, but it's unfair to compare Onikakushi to this behemoth of a story ^^'

Unlike many other VNs, you don't have choices. You don't have gameplay sequences like in Zero Escape or Danganronpa. You just read, that's all. ""So, this isn't a game ?"" Yes and no. It could be, depending of your wishes. Ryukishi07 challenges you with his mystery, it's up to you whether you want to solve it or not. It's the only way to enjoy this as a game : a battle of wits between you and the author. At your disposal, you have almost every chapter Tips, which are the only real form of player interaction with the story. Once again, it's up to you whether or not you want to read them. Some of them are probably useless, but most of them expands on the universe. You probably won't solve the full mystery with only this first chapter, Onikakushi is pretty simple to solve in retrospective, but you won't have all the clues in your hands before the third chapter. I said above that Onikakushi works well as a stand-alone novel, you have no obligation to continue after it, but you won't be able to figure out the full puzzle. I'll say it once more : it's up to you. Onikakushi still stays an interesting story, which follows quite well the tropes of the fantastic genre defined in the XIXth century.

I reached the end of my review, hope you liked it ^^

"Just finished this game last night. And what else can I say, other than...AMAZING!! It's a great throwback to the retro side-scrollers you'd find on something like the NES or SNES. It's difficult, but not impossible, and very well-designed. I can safely say that every time I died (which was quite often), it was always my own fault and not some ludicrious mechanic of the game that was poorly explained. Not a single hiccup on the game's part. The soundtrack is very nice. Catchy. The bosses were all interesting and fun to fight. I've been reading other reviews and it seems like everything that needs to be said about this game has already been said, so I'll conclude with a very enthusiastic, bordering on demanding, GET THIS GAME!!!",True

"Super fun. If you have a competitive nature and want somthing new to learn I highly recomend For Honor. Think of is as a 3D fighing game. It has modes for the less competitive as well and overall is a solid title. 

Does it have issues? Yes. Some people have issues connecting to the Peer to Peer system and you must have Uplay with internet. 

However, the campaign is actually pretty good and Co-Op too. The multiplayer is a blast, usually I dont have a ton of fun playing mutliplayer matches on my own but this is an exception for me. They had a beta weekend for free and probably, like Rainbow Six, have free wekends to try iy out. So if you are on the fence as to if it is worth $60 try it out when you have the chance, I have no regrets if that means anything.",True

Oh yes, this looks like an indie game, feels like an indie game, satisfying combat, graphics are a bit dated. I would however rather have a game with great game play over graphics so I'm ok with it.",True

"The game is fun, the user interface is easy to get used to, and the graphics are good.

If you are new to the genre, the game is a good entry point as the matches are short, maps are small, and easy to understand.

"I absolutely love horror games, including ones like The Resident Evil series Amnesia: Rebirth & The Outlast Series, but I just couldn't get into this game. Alien 1 is one of my favorite horror films and this game does manage to capture the atmosphere perfectly, but the gameplay is nothing but frustrating. Almost every encounter in the game requires you to die several times first before knowing where to go and what to avoid, and even worse there is no reliable checkpoint system in-place. Dying means rewatching cutscenes, listening to expositional dialogue sequences all over again, and repeating multi-step objectives that will involve you having to avoid insta-death scenarios for lengthy stretches of time with no save points available. 

Even though there is an entire ship for the Xenomorph to roam around, it seemingly only searches (at most) up to 1 room away from Ripley at any given moment. Being seen means being caught & its ears are 100x more reliable than the equipment given to the player in-game. I really really want to like this game, but unless they suddenly update it with a quicksaving feature then I'm not interested in playing anymore sadly. You end up forgetting what fear feels like & instead become much more intimate with tedium & annoyance.

Great story & atmosphere
annoying gameplay with a promising start

"If you were lucky enough to have played this game when it started and throughout the first year - year and a half, then you know this game had huge potential.  Unfortunately, there was never any focus on refining this game - there are just as many bugs as when it came out - all recent effort has gone into gimmicky crap and the game no longer has any balance or direction whatsoever.  If you're considering playing this game, just do yourself a favor and don't bother with official servers - they're constantly targeted for DDoS attacks to force players out of a server, the developers have never gotten a handle on duping and cheating in general, and the ability move players and dinos across servers have allowed huge mega tribes to just target one server after the other, overload it with players and dinos until the game is nearly unplayable, and destroying everything.  You'll at least have a better experience on private servers with people you know, though, be warned, the game requires a lot of time investment for things such as taming and raising dinos; dinos that you may find fall through the world and can never be retrieved, or drown in a 2 inch puddle of water... these things happen.

"One of the few games i'm proud I bought at full price. Even though you ""beat"" the game one or two times, you'll never become bored because there's an incredible amount of items, bosses, characters, enemies, achievements, etc that will keep you entertained for a pretty good amount of time. 

Every time you start a new game, it feels different than any other you played before. You can get pretty good items combinations or you can even think of your own tecniques to beat certain boss or group of enemies. Also, don't forget there are a lot of of mods you can try off that either adds items or changes the way this game is played. I reccommend getting the two add ons so you enjoy the full experience.

If you have a low end pc/laptop you can play this gem without any problems so, don't worry of asking if you can run it. Mostly, any 2010> computer/laptop can run this game perfectly.

My only ""con"" with this game is that, after you beat the game like 3 times, the last two levels have a very big difficulty curve. I really struggle with those two levels because, even if I have a good combination of items, sometimes the amount of enemies can overcome me and it's pretty frustrating. Maybe more practice will actually help me to beat with ease those two levels.

Anyways. Maybe this game has a pretty strange learning curve but in the end you will find yourself enjoying it because of the different aproaches you have to finish a level. So, if you don't like ""strange"" learning curves games, you might want to try elsewhere how this game works before purchasing it.

PS: I recommend playing it with controller. For me, it's easier to control, both movement and attack, with a controller.",True

"Pros:

Thoughtful, weighty combat
Eerie, atmospheric music
Interesting use of light and line of sight as a gameplay mechanic
Well designed bosses and general enemies
Doesn't hold your hand - allows you to discover mechanics and preferred playstyles for yourself

Cons:

Simplistic art style
Awkward controls
Frequent crashes
Friendly AI often bugs out, sometimes with frustrating consequences
Possible to miss important items early on, making the game much more difficult

DarkMaus is an interesting, generally well made top down RPG which takes clear inspiration from Dark Souls, though it has enough unique and interesting mechanics to hold the player's attention. It may not be as long as a Souls game, but this means that it doesn't outstay its welcome and, overall, is a very good experience for the pricetag.

However, there are a few isues I have with the game and, given the fact that the dev is known to respond to feedback, I feel that they should be pointed out.

A lot of people, including Dark Souls veterans, seem to find this game too difficult in all the wrong ways. I disagree. I feel that a lot of the negative reviews for this game came out of the fact that the players missed a near-essential item that allows for friendly ghosts to spawn and help you in combat. There are three of these items (that I know of) in the game and, without them, the game would have been much harder. These items are found in areas you have no reason to go back to - if you don't find them, then you are going to be at a disadvantage for the rest of the game.

Friendly AI is appalling. I am referring specifically to an NPC who will accompany you later in the game (but also to the ghosts to a lesser degree). He will walk into spikes, get stuck in doorways, blunder into traps, agro onto enemies we have no chance of defeating, and, on one occasion, he couldn't get through a doorway, on the other side of which there was an archer. He blocked the entire passage, so I couldn't get through to kill the archer. He wouldn't de-agro from the archer, no matter what I did. I had to go around the long way ariund (emphasis on long) and kill the archer from behind, by which point my ally had died and required a precious healing item in order to be revived.

One more problem I have is rather contradictory to the common concensus - I believe that there are too many healing items. By the end of the game I was sitting on a large stockpile of morsels and I was able to cheese the final boss by killing his three minions and then simply mashing quick attack while eating them. I never even needed to use medium or large morsels in the entire game - the number of small morsels I had was a great plenty. This was also taking into account how many morsels Destrian devoured in order to get through the fortress of traps which, as it turns out, he never needed to go through in the first place. It just wasn't properly explained what I was supposed to do when I rescued him. I had assumed that he would unlock a door in the fortress for me but this wasn't the case.

Weapon balance seems a little bit strange - it appears to me that if you aren't using a katana and shield as well as having some skill at pyromancy then you are just doing it wrong. Maybe it's just my personal preferred playstyle, but I can't imagine playing without a shield, a quick sweeping attack provided by the katana, and the ability to throw shield-ignoring fireballs if necessary.

Regardless of these issues, I believe DarkMaus is a fantastic game and it is well worth the price. If you are a Souls fan, you would be doing yourself a disservice if you did not play it.",True
i like this game because it is fun and historical,True
I can't say anything new that hasn't already been said.  The game is great.  Expect to drop some hours on this game.,True
"This was by far the greatest FPS of it's generation. Bold statement? Yes. Fact? Yes. A real masterpiece of UE2 creation and Ubisoft really hit the nail on the head with this. The level of tactics, balance and skill-based gameplay make this a real legend. Something I'm sure many players will reminisce over even after another 10/20 years have passed. The Xbox version in particular was a real gem.

The thrill and rush of being the last man alive in an important ladder/tourney match and strafing the balls out of a whole team with 1-shot kills. Spending hours learning every trick, quickshot and grenade in the book. Placing a claymore or remote charge in outrageous places in the open during crucial matches and actually getting a top-10 player with it. The outrage at ""host advantage"" when you just clearly missed and all your teammates saw that you bottled it.

I lost multiple 1000s of hours of my life to this game back in the day, and this is no exaggeration. It set the benchmark for what a skill and tactic based competitive shooter should be. I would run home after school to play countless hours on this, and entire summers were devoured by the addictive nature of clan rivalry and 1-upmanship. 

The community was at the foundation of it's appeal. You could play the game and catch out players hiding under different names across different clans by seeing and analysing how they played. Everyone knew everyone. Most people had a mic and weren't an annoying little kid.

I was one of the highest ranked players in a consistent top-3 world Clan during the golden years of R63 and Black Arrow, mainly on Xbox. Nothing really compared since. There is a hole in my gaming life. I don't miss the lag or host advantage though. 

Sure there were some annoying and bad things, though massively offset by the greatness of the gameplay. Also sadly, this didn't really age too well at all in terms of looks, but then again at the time of writing this it's 16 years old, but I'm sure it would give Siege a run for its money and then some.

If I could rewind time and play again with what I know now in life, I can think of very few things that would bring such joy.",True
The game is amateurish in the graphics department and a bit buggy here and there but movement and gameplay is absolutely amazing. Its easy to recommend this game! Good work guys!,True
I believe people rate this game low because campaign mode is episodic and you need to buy each one separately. Actually the story is quite good eventhough the graphics is not that good.

I have an ultra wide monitor as well and it sucks that the ratio does not work well but I find it fine to play with bars on the side for now until HBS gets it fixed.

"So you might be thinking about getting this game because you like the souls games. I'll say that this is by far the best souls clone game out there at the time of writing this. It even does many things better than the souls games. For instance combat is way better. I went through all of DS games beating just about every enemy and every boss with the basic R1 R1 roll away combo with the occasional parry. This game has a better and deeper combo system along with the limb targeting. Things it doesn't do better than dark souls is boss battles. There's only 5 and only 2 of those were interesting.

"After years of supporting Oovee Games over their sellout partners, it is, unfortunately, time to move on.

The last update (released on the 2nd August) completely broke the physics (as well as many mechanical systems) of the game; it is now wholly unplayable in its vanilla form.

The community members have found workarounds that involve rolling back to earlier states of development, but this is not ideal. The game is broken, dead, and the developers have not made any effort to address the hundreds of complaints made regarding these serious issues.

Even if the developers decided to release a patch at a later stage, months of silence is simply unacceptable; I am uninstalling this for good, and as it is not an EA title in its current form, I will be requesting a full refund on the grounds of the game being unplayable and abandoned by its developers. I don't believe this will amount to anything, but if theres even the slightest chance that I'm able to take money out of the developers' pockets, I'll take it.

If you're considering buying this, don't; it's done for.

Edit: As of December 2020, Oovee has committed to releasing more paid DLC rather than addressing the issues embedded in the August release. Some progress has been made in terms of returning the game to a more playable state, but the developers are riddled with cowardice, neither admitting to their errors or being open about what they're working on fixing next. I hate to say this, but, if this is your kind of game, you're better off buying into the Mud Runners franchise.",False

"Fast paced, aggressive, no hold barred, relentless, bloody, horrific, overwhelming and extremely satisfying combat. Put down your coffee, this isn't your grandparents video game, it'll take all of your focus and speed to escape death at the hands of the armies of hell. 
One of the smoothest single player experiences I have had, the campaign was surprisingly long to me and justifies the cost even if you don't plan on playing online.
DOOM is that game you turn on when you just feel like breaking something, as every glory kill is so satisfying. DOOM allows you to kill hordes of demons and feel awesome while doing it, smashing and blasting away while barely scraping out of nearly every encounter.
Highly recommended.",True

"You'll probably see a lot of negative reviews for glitches and bugs. I too experieced this, but I figured out why. This is a
next-gen game that uses next-gen graphics. If your gpu is below a generation 720 (Nvidia Geforce is all I know) or so, the game is unplayable. That's not the games fault. That's your crappy hardwares fault. Beyond graphical glitches involving the gpu, the game is the best in the franchise. The new parkour system is wonderful. People say you can't enter windows, but if you read the tips it says ""press LT to enter window."" The only downsides I've noticed is an occasional frame-rate drop in crowded areas and a lack of whistling.  Please add whistling Ubisoft.

Gives you nothing but angst. If I would really want to experience the cruel bitterness of the society when it is relieved of any control, I don't have to buy a game. 

The slimey experience to ""get by"" day by day is demolished when a group of ""ServerStarters"" nick you out of your 200 wood under your skin.

"Lots of fun initially, very atmospheric, great soundtrack. Combat and travel takes place on a 2D plane, so you can't go up or down. Feels like you are playing the ship combat of Assassin's Creed Black Flag, which is honestly the best part of it. Double Damage should just make a pirate/naval game with this engine.

However, does get a bit repetitive after a few systems. Theres only the few mission types you can get from stations and once you finish the main storyline there isn't much left to do but grind the same few mission types for credits and upgrading your ship. You will get some solid gameplay hours until then though, and if you like sandboxes with no objective then you might find it enjoyable even at the end.",True
Cute casual game. Fun for kids and adults. I love spending a little time playing this game. I can't make a bridge to save my life.  Oh well it is a playground after all.,True
"This is a really good space game.

The game offers various control methods to let you fly your ship like a pilot/dogfighter or play more of a commander role using turret view. At first it takes a while to get used to the controls and fight effectively with a style you like but once you play out a few battles out you will find a control style that suits you and probably end up switching between them depending on the situation and the ship you are using.

The graphics and interface are really nice and the game runs very well on my medium system which is an AMD APU with integrated graphics.

The sound effects are good but some cool warp like sound effect for the t-drive would be nice. The music is very good although perhaps some more variety would be nice especially for the battle music. 

The story and voice acting is probably the weakest part of the game but the game offers plenty of freedom to explore space and play how you want to. So you can play like a pirate or a trader, mine or do missions etc. There's plenty to do and it's all fun.

The game has a nice rpg element which means you can upgrade your skills for when you are in battle and upgrade perks for various different effects like trading bonuses or ship capture bonuses etc. You can customise your ships weapons and buy bigger and better guns and ships as you progress through the ranks and acquire more credits. 

Overall I would recommend getting this game, especially if you are into space games.",True

"Dissapointing.  Series peaked with Modern Warfare 2.  Its time to wipe the slate clean and start over. 

Online experience is unbalanced and dissapointing.  Who wants to play with enraged preteens that only run-n-gun with no strategy?   I also dont buy into the campaign storyline. If they could have shot the train in the first place they should have. Revenge is not a compelling story.  Finally, the game engine needs work -- there needs to be a better cover system, less lag, etc to make gameplay really improve.  It hasnt changed for like 5 games now. 

Matchmaking system is terrible.  Most of the better game types dont have enough people playing, -- unless you have bought all the DLC.  

I liked the dog though.  Maybe the next one should just be a dude and his dog in a postapocalyptic wasteland.  No heavy weapons.  Just rifles and tactics.

Disclaimer: I do still play a fair amount.  Need to get my money's worth!  Just wish it was a lot better than this.  It is still better than the majority of shooters ... but knowing I'm getting cheated on what should have been DLC for the last Modern Warfare .. that makes me upset.",False

"Started playing this game a while back, began very glitchy and quite frustrating at times, but as the alpha grew and grew, the game became loads of fun and full of opportiunties for both large success and great failure. Overall I love this game, and I probably play it most out of all of my games. It has come a great way from where it has started and never seems to let me down when I'm looking for a challenge, or browsing the steam workshop just to find a prison I can download that looks like a turtle. One bad thing about this game though is it can be very difficult to start out playing if you have no clue what you are doing and/or have no help, youtube does help a lot though in that case.  11/10",True

"I can easily recommend every game in Borderlands franchise, to everyone who like to play looter-shooters. What I don't recommend is for video game companies, to employ ret***ed (omg, they censor this word) idiots who believe, that putting a big, irritating banner of their new game in main menu of their earlier title is a great idea to increase sales. I like Borderlands, so I'm perfectly aware, that Borderlands 3 is out and I'm going to buy it, when I decide to. Your f***ing importunate marketing policy won't change that, so why don't you take that banner down and shove it up your a**es?",False
"I wasn't originally attracted to this game. I hadn't played the original game and I often find games with military themes uninteresting. But since I like turn-based strategy I was still a bit curious and when they had a free weekend I decided to give it a try. And after that I just couldn't stop playing! The game is fantastic and playing it in Ironman mode (not possible to load earlier saves) adds another dimension. Bad decisions have to be dealt with and I found myself mourning the soldiers I lost. A good story in a game is very important for me but XCOM is one of the few games where I didn't care that the story was quite bad. The simple yet deep tactical combat gameplay forgives it and in Ironman mode I also found that I was making up my own stories for the soldiers and the hardships they went through. 

The bottom line: XCOM is a wonderful game with soul and I can't recommend it enough!

"I have played Plague Inc for hours on my phone. I'm not usually interested in mobile games, but that one was so addictive that I couldn't stop playing it. Needless to say, I was delighted to see the game on Steam.
First, if you, like me, have played this elsewhere you will notice this is a worth upgrade. Although gameplay remains mostly unchanged, it feels fluid and fitting. Graphics are better and I'm quite fond of the new soundtrack. Oh, and better yet: no in-app purchases this time.

Although it is still in early access, I haven't found any bugs so far. As the developer himself stated, he is still adding features to the game (which is great), but it is a solid, bug-free release.

As far as the game itself goes, you are supposed to ""destroy the world"", but not with guns or explosives. You are a pathogen who needs to evolve an illness to kill. It's an interesting and original concept. You have to use your brain and create a strategy. It can be challenging and as you progress the game you can unlock more content, so there's plenty to keep you busy for a while.",True

None of the arcs have disappointed me, though the first mission of the Inquisitor one was a little tough to complete.",True

"I love this game and play it a lot. The style is amazingly well done and beautiful. The gameplay is simple point and click but thats all that is needed, and the developers have handled this mechanic very well. There's a lot to do, and although multiple playthroughs might get repetitive for some, there are different groups of survivors to choose from, which come with varied obstacles to tackle differently.

Each character has a unique skill and personality, with different needs and react differently to different events, which may effect how you can play. (e.i. some characters despise the idea of stealing and killing, while others aren't bothered by it.) Its fun to get attatched to these characters and watch as your actions lead to their horrible death, which makes everyone else depressed.

Another thing I will say is that this game has a very helpful wiki that is worth checking out.

"Before I go into detail, I want to get one thing perfectly straight. I love this game.
It's amazing! I realize that there are a lot of other survival games out there that people are comparing ARK to, but honestly, to me it's one of a kind. I have about 48 hours under my belt while I'm writing this, and I have to say that those have been the best 48 hours of my life. At first I was really worried, because a lot of the reviews had said that their computers couldn't handle it. My computer was custom-built by my sibling for me. I have no idea what kind of graphics card and stuff it has, and so I was worried when I bought it. After customzing the performance until I liked it, I began to play.
I started in a singleplayer world, got to about level 10, then decided to join a multiplayer server. I had some fun, then I went back to SP. I tried taming a few dodos, which worked... until a bronto squashed them. Then I went for a parasaur, named it Perri (because it was a girl). Then she died, and I tamed another, Perry, (a boy). Perry died as well.
I would not recommend this game for anyone who can't move on from a relationship with a pet. It's just a game. I was a little sad too, but then I started getting into the 20-25 levels. After taming a trike, I tried my luck at a dilo. Tamed the dilo, and then two turtles. I was like, ""THIS GAME IS AWESOME!"" That's when the lag started to happen. At first it was little, maybe 5 fps. Then it increased, until I was down to about 20 fps. Then my computer froze altogether. Then ARK crashed. Mind you, this was after about 8 days (In real life) since I bought the game. I took a little break, then rebooted ARK. After about another 30 minute, it crashed again. It might have something to do with my internet, but not likely. I suggest that you find out what kind of computer you have (if you don't know) before you buy ARK. Research your graphics card and other things in your computer. 
All in all, I would definitally recommend this. ARK has a deep, detailed backstory to it and anyone can enjoy it. 
Peace out!

A few days after I wrote this, and no crashes since. I have not had any trouble with the game after those two crashes, so maybe it did have something to do with my internet. I hope this was helpful!",True

"I HAVE REACHED 1,000 HOURS ON GMOD! TIME TO WRITE A REVIEW!!

This game, is a good....No really! The sheer amount of things you can do in this game is incredible!
You could mess around with workshop weapons, maps, and cars. You could spawn a bunch of enemies and challenge yourself to how many you can kill with a certain weapon before dieing. You could make an abandend version of construct (which is one of the defalt maps) using only the props given. you could creat stuff with the amazing amount of otions for your tool gun!

But that's just the sandbox...There are also GAMEMODES! You start with a couple games, but there are so much more on the workshop! These gamemodes are extremely fun to play with friends, or strangers online!

That's another thing! Steam workshop! The thing that always keeps Garry's mod interesting. There are so many things there, that your not going to get bored for a while.

Now you may be thinking to yourself, ""Seems really complacated and confusing..."" Don't sweat it! Just go to sandbox, and try out the differant things you can do. the more you play, the more familiar you become with the game.

If you couldn't tell already, I highly do NOT recomend this game......JK, BUY THIS GAME!!!",True

All you do is hold forward, the game plays itself. There's about as much mechanical engagement here as there is in a visual novel. But at least visual novels have engaging stories. The game has a story that takes itself way too serious and it just feels like fantasy Star Wars.

The soundtrack also feels like generic fantasy music and it gets real irritating real fast.

"I've been a fan of the franchise since the 1st one, and I think this is the best one so far. I never really got into playing the most recent one, I was more a fan of the original two. One thing I like about this iteration is that, while there are a lot of expensive things, there are also a lot of easy missions early on that can build up money very quickly. Within hours, I was able to start buying additional ships. Instead of pros & cons, I'll just talk about some things I thought were cool.

Early on, I'm flying around in my 1-person starter ship, and I get a mission to hire a pilot for my ship. I do that, and I see someone sitting in my pilot's seat as my ship's pilot. I click the chair to sit down, and his position changes to ""relief pilot"". Now, any time I stand up from my chair, he'll sit down and take over. I can then issue orders from the galaxy map, and stand over his shoulder while he flies the ship. So cool.

A few hours later, I'm letting him fly the ship while I keep an eye on the map for missions, and we get attacked by pirates. I take over, shoot them down, and the pirate escapes his ship and leaves it behind. I fly over, take command, and now I have two ships. Since I already hired a pilot, I give him the orders to continue on, and I take a nearby mission. Eventually, I'm docking at a trading station, and my pilot finished his task, so I give him the order to join me. I dock, take care of what I needed, and as I finish up, I see he's now arriving. I got to stand on the station and got to watch him fly in and dock, and have two of my ships docked next to each other. So coool.

A few years ago, I was glad that I didn't pre-order the previous X game when it bombed in the reviews. Now, I'm glad to have bought this at full price because it feels worth it. I can't wait to see where Egosoft goes from here.",True
GOOD GAME BRUUUUUHHHH,True
it is tones of  fun and plays with mechanics if you fight Sans plus it has multiple endings,True
"Yes, I'm giving this game a thumbs down, but please read this whole review before you decide whether or not to buy Phantom Doctrine. My reasons for disliking the game might not bother you as much.

Let me start with the good points:
-Customizing and building up agents is a lot of fun.
-Combat is actually pretty cool once you get used to the mechanics.
-No RNG, but luck and taking risks can greatly affect gameplay.

Now, there are several issues with the game. The most glaring problems are some of the OP abilities, such as wearing disguises during infiltrations and using unarmed takedowns to incapacitate enemies. Disguises will radically lower the difficulty of infiltration missions. They prevent most enemies (but not enemy agents) from noticing your character, allowing you to walk around restricted areas and accomplish objectives with ease. Couple disguises with the “actor” perk (which reduces the range at which enemy agents can detect your agent), and your team can effortlessly clear out entire enemy cells without ever raising the alarm.

Unarmed takedown allows your agents to knock out enemies quickly and quietly. This is fine for the stealth phase, but what makes it OP is that you can continue to use it to one-shot enemies even during combat. As long as the enemy has less health than your agent, they can be taken out with an unarmed, close-quarters strike. Many of battles I fought were resolved by having my agents leap out of cover and engage in hand-to-hand. That’s right; firefights can be won by abandoning cover, running up to the enemy, and giving them a good sucker punch. I have not once seen enemies use this tactic (heh, those losers use GUNS instead).

Then there is the difficulty itself. Throughout the game, your team will accumulate stronger gear, fancier gadgets, and later your own personal helicopter for extra dramatic escapes. However, the difficulty does not adjust to match your agents’ growing skills and cool new toys. Every building you break into (even in main story areas) has the same airport-level security as the last place. Security measures are never upgraded. Watchmen do not become more competent. The only noticeable change is that the enemy agents and guards are stronger, which has little effect on the gameplay given the main character’s numerous advantages. By the end of the game, the global conspiracy at the heart of the conflict starts to feel beneath you. Sure, they cannot be destroyed entirely and have unlimited funding, but every operation or cell that pops up is almost immediately obliterated by your vast Big Brother network of spies and informants.

Despite all these issues, I still enjoyed the gameplay. My main issue was with the story. There isn’t much to the story *spoilers ahead*. You might be thinking, “It’s all about the gameplay. Why obsess over the campy 1980s spy storyline?” Well, here’s the problem: The entire campaign is pointless. No matter how well you perform during tactical missions, no matter how insanely effective your spy network becomes, the main storyline always sets your character two steps behind the organization (called “Beholder”) they are hunting. In one of the early missions, your character finds the location of some super-secret enemy cargo. You open it up and *gasp* it’s empty! Most of the main quests end this way; the game is one long series of absurd setbacks. You can complete every side mission with perfect execution, but for the sake of the *story*, you have to constantly watch your character get outplayed by Beholder. Although many complain about the repetitive tactical gameplay, what I found most vexing was the familiar pattern of breakthroughs followed by disappointing setbacks in nearly every chapter of the story.

The nature of the story became apparent to me once I reached the early-mid part of the game as Kodiak (the ex-KGB operative). My quest is to stop the Soviet pilots from shooting down the Korean Air Lines Flight 007. It turns out that Beholder is the culprit behind one of the biggest incidents of the Cold War, and I have to stop it from happening. The story seemingly took a very interesting turn. As a former KGB operative, was it my destiny to prevent a diplomatic disaster and perhaps change history for the better?

It turns out it wasn’t! For after much effort to highjack the fighter pilot’s communications and give the order to disengage, the pilot chooses to down the airliner anyway, thus fulfilling a fixed point in history. Upon realizing the inflexibility of the story, I tried to focus on simply enjoying the tactical gameplay and character-building. However, the game just did not feel the same after the KAL007 mission. I had become adept at both combat and infiltration, could manage the spy network in my sleep, and could easily break the game by fully utilizing the OP abilities. None of it mattered. No matter how many operations were executed to perfection, it had no impact on the story. Kodiak’s overall performance would never be improved through side operations.

During the last chapter of the game, it is discovered that Beholder’s main hub is located in Grenada. Kodiak’s American ally uses her influence to get Reagan to invade Grenada (Another unnecessary historical tie-in! How clever!) so that the area can be secured after the bunker is raided by my team. After a rather anti-climactic battle with the main villain (a nerdy tech CEO with the code name “Valhalla”), the ending is triggered and Kodiak narrates what happens next. As with the KAL007 flight and invasion of Grenada, history continues on its uninterrupted path. Communism falls, the Soviet Union dissolves, and the Cold War ends. My character notes that this is what Beholder wanted all along, and ponders if the man I just killed wasn’t just the puppet of a much stronger force.

So were any of my efforts actually worth it? True, Valhalla tried to destroy both superpowers at the last minute with nuclear missiles (I had to abort the launch), but that’s only because Kodiak chased him into a corner by raiding his hideout in the first place. If she had not killed the supposed brains behind Beholder, would anything have been different? I suppose one could argue that with Beholder destroyed, they cannot control the US and Russian governments. Things might work out with the absence of the evil corporation ruling the world through puppets.

Great job, Kodiak! Man, I can’t even begin to imagine a world ruled by large, evil corporations.

"Despite what people say about the game, it comes down to if YOU enjoyed the old classic rts games (i.e Command and Conquer). If you did, then this game will be a blast to the past for you. Its very enjoyable and has a high skill cap for mastering the mechanics of the game. Basically, its easy to pick up on, hard to master. If you're not a fan, nor have never played older rts games, I'd still reccomend this game as the matches are very quick and full of action. The only complaint I have about the game is the player base. It needs to GROW, because as of now, its pretty hard to find a game.",True
"[b]Quick Breakdown:[/b] A strategy game in which you control various types of plagues in an effort to destroy humanity. Plague types include viruses, fungus, brain worms, zombie infection, bio-weapons, and even one that grants apes super intelligence (inspired by the planet of the apes). Custom user made scenarios allow for even more plague types to be played with.
[b]Length:[/b] 10-12 hours (Main game)
[b]Score:[/b] 8/10
[b]Review Date[/b] 2015-05-10 (Early Access)

[b]Full Review:[/b] [i]Plague Inc: Evolved[/i] (PEI) is a follow up to the game [i]Plague Inc[/i], which was originally released on mobile devices. I didn’t play the original game, so I’m not able to compare the two games, so I’ll just point out that this one has all the content from the original game, plus quite a bit more. And since the game is in early access still, there should be more content released in the future.

But onto the game itself, in PEI you control different types of plagues, evolving them so that they can wipe out humanity. You pick a country to begin your plague in, and from there it begins to infect people, spreading across the globe. As it infects more and more people you earn DNA, which you use to evolve your plague. There a few different ways to evolve your plague, such as the how it’s able to transmit itself to other hosts, the symptoms that carriers experience, different plague abilities, such as being able to withstand more extreme temperatures and medicinal drugs, as well as plague unique abilities (more on those later).

The strategy element of the game comes in how you evolve your plague. If you’re plague isn’t spreading to island countries, then you can evolve it to transmit more effectively via boat. You can evolve it so that birds act as carriers, increasing land based transmissions.

As your disease begins to evolve symptoms, doctors will notice its existence, and will begin working on a cure. As the plague becomes more severe, countries around the world will begin funneling more money into cure research. Once the cure is complete, it will be administered worldwide, eradicating your plague. Obviously, this is counter-productive to annihilating the human race, which is why you’ll want to evolve symptoms and abilities that slow cure research. Another option is to not evolve, and even devolve symptoms until the entire world is infected, and then evolve highly lethal symptoms to kill off humanity before they can cure themselves.

There are random events that can occur, such as planes using advanced sterilization filters, preventing your plague from spreading via air travel, unless you evolve your plague to overcome that setback.

How you evolve your plague will depend on not only these random events and how your plague is spreading (or struggling to spread), but also on your plague type, forcing you to adapt your strategy accordingly.

When you begin the game you’ll only have one plague type available to you, the humble bacteria. Once you manage to use it to eliminate humanity on normal difficulty or higher you’ll unlock your next plague type, the virus. The more you destroy humanity, the more plague types will become available to your disposal (and subsequently the disposal of humanity). Different plague types have different unique traits and abilities; bacteria for example are fairly straight forward, but allow you to evolve special renitences to the environs. Viruses evolve symptoms rapidly, forcing you to accommodate your playstyle to accommodate. Fungal plagues have greater difficulty spreading, and must evolve spores to spread more effectively.

Some of the more interesting plague types including the neurax worm, which is a type of brain worm that allows you control over the hosts. This allows you to influence their behaviour, either putting off cure research, engaging in dangerous activities to oneself, endangering the lives of themselves and others (even up to suicide), and even causing them to travel to countries of your choice to further spread the disease.

There’s of course the necroa virus, which turns dead people into zombies, reanimating them. From here you can control their movement, cause them to attack those still alive, both killing and infecting them.

There’s even a virus inspired by [i]The Planet of the Apes[/i], called the Simian Flu (which you being with, since it’s a bonus plague type). It’s quite an interesting plague, since not only does it infect humans, afflicting them with symptoms, some of which are lethal, but when apes contract the same disease they become more intelligent. From here you can evolve the disease to spread more effectively amongst humans, or among apes, or you can even evolve cross-species transmission. You can evolve symptoms to ail humanity, or abilities to strengthen ape-kind. These abilities include combat abilities, letting apes free captive apes used for scientific experiments designed to find a cure. Travel abilities that allow the apes to travel across land, and even build rafts to traverse the ocean. Apes can evolve to build communities, which give you additional DNA to use for evolving your plague.

When selecting your plague, you can also insert different genes into your plague to bolster its abilities. These are chosen before you begin a game with a plague, and you unlock a new gene every time you complete a game with any plague. Some gene types are universal, and some are specific to certain plague types. Genes help in different ways, such as giving you bonus DNA, increasing transmission efficiency by certain means, or altering costs for evolving/devolving your plague.

While that comprises the bulk of the gameplay, there are also different scenarios that you can play. These feature a special condition, such as people being able to teleport to other countries with the use of a portal gun (yes, from the game [i]Portal[/i]). Others feature special plague types, which are slight alterations to the main plague types in the game. Depending on the scenario, you may be able to choose your plague type and gene loadout, or it may be preselected.

There are also user created scenarios, which allow for even more ways to destroy humanity. I haven’t delved too far into the user created scenarios yet, but so far I’ve managed to play one that features demon possession, and another that is based on John Carpenter’s [i]The Thing[/i] (one of my favourite movies). There’s of course the option to build your own custom scenarios, but I haven’t yet played with this.

A typical game varies in length, generally about 15-30 minutes, depending on a variety of factors. It took me somewhere between 1-3 hours before I first successfully destroyed humanity, and my times from there varied by plague type. All in all, it took me between 10-12 hours to win a game on normal with each plague type at least once; and I’ve put in a total of 18 hours into the game so far, trying out different strategies and higher difficulties for the plagues, and having fun with the scenarios. I expect I’ll sink in quite a few more hours into the game.

The main criticism I have is that the game is sometimes a bit unclear on what different plague traits do, though one could argue that this testing and experimentation is part of the appeal. Other than that, the game lacks a tutorial at this point, which while I understand that the game is in early access still and isn’t complete, that’s something you think would be included already.

On the plus side, the game has keyboard shortcuts for any of the actions you need to take in game, minimizing how much you need to use the mouse. On top of that it allows you to remap all the controls as you see fit (though I find the default to work without issue).

In the end, [i]Plague Inc: Evolved[/i] is an engrossing strategy game where you help bring about humanity’s end. It has a lot more content than I expected in it, and it’s certainly worth the $15 price tag.",True
"
And yes this game needs some serious polishing. 

But , this is a serious simulation , and not another shooter clone. 
Being a fireman is following protocol and executing it at the best you can. 
Knowing the drills means you can improvise on them in new and daring situations.
This is how firedepartments in europe operate.

Simulations like this give a realistic insight on what it realy means to be a fireman (not the hollywood style one).
This is where Notruf succeeds you can practice the protocol, what equipment you need , connect the lines and hoses.
You can actually learn something from this. (dont know if there is already an implimatation of first aif procedures , would be a nice addition(tapping the space bar 30/2)

Emergency games are a still a niche market but there is so much potential in it. 

There are other heroes that put their life on the line everyday to help others and they dont need a gun to do so.

Advice , smooth the experience , keep the details functional, maybe implement a bit of physics.

"Pretty decent game. I love management games and RTS games, and this is a good combination of the two. You do jobs for cities, trade, fight outlaws, Native Americans, and the Confederacy, or you can pay them off and then trade with them. It's up to you. The game does have some limitations, and is rather short (beat it in under 8 hours).

"Don't be misled by the mixed overall reviews on Steam. It was flooded by a lot of bad reviews on release because of terrible connectivity issues which have since been resolved. This is currently one of the best games you can get on Steam.

Onto my review:

From the perspective of someone who's played every generation before: There are a lot of quality of life improvements: Radial Menus, Auto-crafting, using potions while walking, etc. Some skills like autotracking, perception are built into the UI; mix-matching armor skills is also much simpler due to the removal of skill points; and many others. Areas are wide, expansive, with some interesting monster interactions going on. Gone are the 'zoning' days where you areas are separated by loading screens. The areas, Ancient Forest in particular, feel so much more alive with the addition of wildlife, destructible areas, and the many nooks and crannies to explore. No underwater combat. Mobility has been greatly improved with the ability to slide down slopes, sling from certain spots spider man style (so awesome), faster wall climbing, etc.

If you're new to the series, what can I say? Huge monsters and a wide variety of weapons with unique play styles. It's like a best of the best series of boss fights. Hunting a giant monster is very satisfying, and even more so is using its parts to make better gear to hunt stronger monsters. Monster Hunter World is just the latest in this well-refined series that keeps getting better.",True

Its fun and theres lots to do.  The combat is really well made and is fun even after hours of play.

Only problem is the game doesnt run that great but its full of enemies and looks good so thats understandable.,True
"Eisenhorn: Xenos is a very special kind of game which is most definitely not aimed at the general public. Once and foremost, it is an interactive retelling of a Warhammer 40K book. That's what it ultimately is, not only in its core but in its entirety. This leads to two problems.

1. The entire gameplay is just filler material to progress the story and the gameplay which is in there is probably only in there to not have made it a walking simulator with cutscenes.
2. The fact that there was zero focus on actual gameplay shows massively in the form of very half-baked mechanics.

If you are interested in Eisenhorn, be ready to play only to progress the story and to get annoyed by very dodgy combat and stealth mechanics. Be also ready about hit and miss voice-acting. Some of it awe inducing, some of it so awful that it is mainly inducing cringeworthy mental pain.

Most of the writing is taken close to literally from the book Xenos and this is both a blessing and a curse: The parts which are copypaste are absolutely amazingly written, most parts that are not, are massively lacking in impact.

On the technical side it's wonky too, being a mobile port, but to me it looked reasonably well on 4k with everything cranked up to the maximum. The main selling point are the story and the atmosphere after all and those are spot on. Everything looks as if you would have imagined it, sometimes even better and more grandiose. The feeling of the Warhammer 40K universe is absolutely perfectly conveyed and this is what the entire project mainly was about.

I, personally, had a lot of fun with Eisenhorn: Xenos, being a Warhammer 40K fan. At the time of playing I had not actually read the books, but I ended up getting them because I was so amazed by the fantastic writing. And oh boy was it worth it. I really do hope that the other two (soon to be three with Magus) books get digital adaptations as well.

Judging the game as a game, it's a shoddy game appealing to diehard fans at best. Judging the game as an interactive book, it's amazing.

I'm going to do the latter and hope that if there will be a game for the second of three (soon to be four) books as well, it'll do a better job in regard to mechanics.

I can't technically recommend this to everyone, but I simply refuse to downvote a product I personally had an amazing time with, as even with all its flaws, it did manage to entertain me a great deal.

So this isn't for everyone, but a must have for people who enjoy stories over gameplay.",True

"So this is one of those fun and good sort of spin off games such as this one that were originally a Xbox 360 exclusive but given a re-release update and launched again for second time on Steam over 7 years later. As a Halo and PC RTS fan who originally looked at this game at first, I were mostly.... eh, dammit. I'd give the game a pass. To experience RTS in its glory is to play the darn game on PC with precise mouse clicks and keyboard controls instead of the controller where you may accidentally misclick your dudes there with the left thumb stick.

But now given now that the game is out on PC and on Steam in enchanced edition I'm actually pleased with the game and, after spending hours and hours into the game, the gameplay is different from other titles such as Age of Empires and Commander & Conquer.

Gameplay in the game is different because at the start of nearly every campaign mission or skimish matches, your HQ Building is in form of Firebases (UNSC) or Command Center (Covenant) with 5 slots which you can order, and quee up, new buildings on such as Supply Pads/Warehouse, Barracks/Hall, etceria. Of course, you aren't to be slated with only 5 slots as you can upgrade the main building up to level 3 that then will grant you 7 building slots to work with. Only downside to this type of base building is that upon destruction of Firebase/Command center, all other structures with it get destroyed as well.

During the gameplay sections, you get to also control leader powers with such as the Heal & Repair ability on UNSC to help out in those tight spots in the evacuation campaign mission as well as keeping your dudes and mechanized units in top shape if the cooldown is bit of a pain at times but for some odd gameplay and/or story reasons you need to spend resources in order to utilize the powers. Also to note on this support powers system is this is expended upon in the sequel.

As for one of other great things about the game is that the story takes place couple of decades before the events of main titles as well as the pretty neat cinematics with one of them even showed off the capabilities of the Spartans we don't normally get to see in the first 3 main FPS games except for H4 and H5 (considering a bit on how disappointing 5 is but just know only that we get to see more of capabilities. As well as in the books) with their agility and strength. The story take place in middle of the war that is slowly going against mankind with the colonies being picked off one by one and it focuses on the support ship Spirit of Fire currently helping out the operations on the planet of Harvest and I wouldn't spoil much on what happens next.

Just know that, chronically, the crew of the ship were the first to ran into, and know about, the Flood first but became incapable of reporting on our most threatening parasitic species to rest of the UNSC and other important bits. Also we get the sequel game super neat enough instead of letting them simply being put on ice (or put on a metaphorically bus, if you want to get literature critic/troper on the game) for eternality.

As being part of the audience, we can also say it is sad and/or suck to know that, chronically, UNSC doesn't know about the threat of the Flood until events of the main FPS games. But again points to the writer(s) for preserving the contiunity of the story but still....

For the final notes to consider on the game; for the OST it is great and the soundtracks is actually composed by the guy who did Age of Empire 3's OSTs and they rather fits Halo quite.... perfectly, I think, and they sound nice especially with those rock out music when assaulting the enemy's stronghold. Also I love how animations for the bases and their add on structures go such as UNSC's supply pads with those supply shuttles bringing in supply crates and going up to show that we are receiving supplies from Spirit of Fire to keep us going or even with the air unit production in Covenant bases having lights blinking to let us know that air units are on the way.

Going back to touch on the gameplay sections, it's actually neat that you can also discover Black Boxes in Campaigns to learn bits of story information on characters and events and such as well as finishing much of the skimish maps and beating the skimish matches with 6 different leaders. Also the difficulty of earning skulls in order to unlock gameplay options during Campaign and then to getting to the skulls will vary depending on mission.

All in all, my conclusion is that Halo Wars is a good game to get. Especially if you haven't played the main games because of their whole being Xbox exclusive games. It is one of those prequel games/books that allow you to know what the war is like and all as well as the characters. Only downside to the game is that, last time as of this review, that Multiplayer is more or less dead unless you goes onto the community hub and asks for matchups against somebody.",True

"Sleeping Dogs is an extremely fun game that is quite similar to GTA in many ways, but set in Hong Kong, and with a much larger emphasis on hand-to-hand combat, Kung Fu, as opposed to gun combat. There is still a bit of gun play later in the game, but it's almost exclusively reserved for story missions, and a handful of side missions.

At a certain point you gain access to a pistol that will always be in your apartments around the city, and that's it. All  automatic weapons must be procured from dead enemies, and you can only have for as long as you hold onto them. I would have preferred there to be some black market with a handful of other guns you could have in your apartments.

The story of the game is pretty engaging as you try to maintain your position as an undercover police officer, and simultaneously deal with a gang civil war, and other gangs as they try to encroach on the gangs' position. [spoiler] Done my boy Jackie dirty. [/spoiler]

I will say it stretches believability that Wei Shen, the main character, is promoted so much throughout the game. In addition, these promotions seem to bring with them no palpable increase in responsibilities, or culpability for his actions as both a gang member, and a police officer.

The DLC are definitely a trip. The ""Zodiac Tournament"" is clearly heavily inspired by the ""Enter the Dragon"" movie, ""Nightmare in North Point"" is ridiculously weird, and ""Year of the Snake"" is fairly similar to the base game. They're enjoyable, and innocuous, but you should definitely do them after  you have completed the main story.

The Good
+ 3 different classes of gladiators all with different fighting stlyes.
+ A fun but somewhat challenging campaign.
+ Fun retro graphics with plenty of gore.
+ Endless campaign allows you to play around with more of the ingame features; upgrading the ludus, upgrading weapons & armour.
+ You are able to take control of your fighters (you need to research something with your doctorae first).
+ Unexpected events which challenge your management skills.

The Bad
- Does get reptitive; only a certain amount of matches, same events occur, campaign only has 9 campaign fights.
- Short campaign.
- The odd bizzare result where your gladiator is much better than the opposition but still loses; this is pretty rare though.

"This game is a lot of fun. I love that you can pick your own music. Can't wait to see the game its final stage.

Though everything seems pretty accurate to the music. I feel like i'm following not just the beats but a little of everything in each song. Not a bad thing, keeps the game challenging, but it would be nice if I could choose what instrument to follow.  
I have been a musician for just over 12 years now, So following rythmes and what not are my forte. 

A feature to select what to track would be cool. Just throwing that out there now while the game is still in development. 
But its good to acknowledge all the aspects of a song/band. 

With this option, it would be awesome. Without it right now, or in the future of this games development, this game is and will be AWESOME!!!

So don't overthink, have doubts or have harsh critisism on this game due to my suggestion. Buy it, its fun.",True
"It is a nice game. Not great, not even good. It is just nice. Paying the full price is not acceptable, And I'm sorry I didn't wait for a sale to buy it. 
I had so many expectations for this game, I loved playing The Neverhood so much, but Armikrog seems so pale in comparison. It's not bad at all, I had some fun hours playing it, but I wanted so much more..

I really loved the way they put some references to The Neverhood, like robot bill on the wall, or the history writings in the wall, or even the cannon , those little details made me smile.

The graphics and the music were gorgeous, really great, but it felt like 80% of the resources for the game were spent on them. The important part about this game was suposed to be the puzzles. I expected that feeling, when you have collected so many clues you have no idea where  to use, and as you progress in the game you find some riddles you have the answer, and find some more clues, and in the end it all FITS it all makes sense. When you are being told a story but there is some fulcral detail you discover in the end that makes you suddenly understand the hole game. I am really sad I didn't have that, the game felt so empty. Most of the clues you knew what they were for not that much later into the game. You never really had to turn back to solve a puzzle that has the answer further ahead. 

It was really linear and really short.The puzzles were not that hard, and I was expecting something much more complicated, more conected, more complex. The game was short, the story had so much potential to be developed and it wasn't. But it wasn't, because to have a satisfactory story the game would have to be SO much longer than it was. They probably didn't have the funds or the time, and that is verry sad indeed, because this game was full of potential.

Somehow the development team missed something indescribable that made The Neverhood so loved. The verry essence of the game, what made it special (besides the claymation, of course) is missing in armikrog. The contents of the game were shallow and underdeveloped and it's really unfortunate it turned out like this.

Nevertheless, it is still worth playing, and worth buying, and I'm sure the development team made the best they could with waht they had. A good game, for those who had no previous expectations for it.",True

"Slightly Interactive Book more than it is a game.

Everything I have encountered so far is 100% scripted. No decision I have made so far seems to have made any impact upon the game or any outcome. While you will make choices, those choices are set in stone and frankly don't make a lot of sense.

So, my unarmored and extremely poorly trained blacksmith's son is suppose to take on two fully armored, armed, and trained people just to save someone which no one in the land apparently likes, respects, or thinks is worth saving? And while someone might say 'Henry would, he's honorable"" - this is the same guy who was willing to go rob graves to pay off a debt. So, yeah.. and why wouldn't Henry simply run to the nearest location and call for help? The two kidnappers are totally out of their realm, without backup while Henry has literally all of the land's militia to call upon.. but nah.. he can take out those two mercs solo, no problem..   -__-    oh and remember he's just a peasant, not some hero..  

sorry, but I just cannot get past the poor story telling. Love the graphics for the most part and this is the first interactive book where I felt that the dog was actually an asset worth having around. But too many problems, especially for a game that apparently prides itself on realism. (I mean come on.. wth would a noblewoman go to a peasant's room, alone in the middle of the night, just to talk? - she is risking pretty much every thing for what...some unknown stranger who is well below her status? it just doesn't make a lick of sense.

"I studied and studied the mechanics and played four iterations of this game (Italy as a Republic, ComIntern France, USA, and Fascist USA).   There's just too many flaws with the AI at the micro and macro level to be playable.

The micro flaws are well documented: you can't complete a battle plan because your divisions are ""never in position"" because it keeps moving them for no reason.  So you go to war without a battle plan and get slaughtered, even taking the time to painstakingly move every unit by hand.    

The macro flaws are worse- whoever your allies are, they are useless as kittens in a paper sack.  USA as allied?  Russia never joins in the war.  OK, lets play commie France to force the issue.  Russia joins the war, and they lose Moscow in less than a year.  The mechanic of taking 70 to 100 days to declare war on anyone makes being a fascist state useless.    THere's nothing to do but play WW2 just as it went historically, so this is not the sandbox game I was hoping for.   I just felt like I wasted 100 hours figuring out the game is unplayable because of its AI flaws.   I commend the developers for the degree of sophistication, but the level of sophistication must be balanced against the ability of the AI to behave rationally, and it seem that whoever you are allied with, that AI is dumber.

"Ok, jokes over. This game is one of the most boring game I've played. Despite thousands of players giving this game their highest praise, I cannot do that. I've played this game with my friends and we all thought it was boring. One thing that is most annoying is that people keep voting for 3v3, and it's one of the most boring mode I've played and experienced. This game is just overall boring to me, the gunplay, gameplay, the annoying ass captain always yelling out orders in a very gay and not realistic way.  Pretty much every aspect of this game is boring to me. Now the only fun part is where we mutiny the captain and took over the ship to ram into enemy ships, what happened next is really saddening to me, we've done more for our team when we tried to troll and sabotage our own ship (mutiny every shitty captain and ram our ship) and ended up winning the game because we kept doing that over and over. Also, another fun thing to do is just tk, I know tk sucks but in this game, It's really fun to band up and tk; Sometimes, every man on the ship will start to kill every player friendly or enemy. Ban me if you want, I ain't returning nor do I care. But yeah, thanks for reading this review and I'll leave it up to you to decide whether to buy this game or not but personally, I don't recommend it at all.

"This game... Why there are not many games like this on steam?
This game is awesome, its original, its rogue like, its hard, the arts are beautiful, the sound is immersive.
[strike]It's 10 out of 10.
I can't tell you anymore just go and buy the game already and have fun or stress with it. [/strike]

Well this scratched part above I gotta correct this.
This game isn't hard, its way above that level. Every single mechanic in this game are there to F*** the player. In hard games you have hard mechanics to challenge the players and less good mechanics to help the player finish the game. Think of Dark Souls, the Bonfire is a good thing right? Imagine Dark Souls without a checkpoint who fills all your health. Nice, now dive into Darkest Dungeon...

So you just leveled some of your characters to level 3, its gotta be a good thing right? 2bad4u. Treating diseases and stress recovering methods just got more expensive. Treating quirks are now too damn expensive you can't even think about it. Well at least they are stronger right? I gotta say this, NO. Your characters just got more stress resistance in lower levels quest. Oooops this is a good mechanic! I found it. NO! Your lv 3 characters can only enter lv 3 or above quests. You  gotta be kidding. The only good part of leveling is that you unlock more levels of weapons and armors in blacksmith and unlock more levels of skills in the guild, [b]IF[/b] you are able to invest harder in one character, and in this game a single critical hit with a bleeding effect can kill anyone.

The [b]Critical Hits[/b]... Who doesn't love them? In normal games they are your luck helping you defeat a strong boss. In Darkest Dungeon they are your worst nightmare. The enemy has the same chance of critting in you that you have to critting them, well, it depends of the character. But when you have someone in the party with the biggest stress you can sure hope it will get a critical strike from the enemy and things gonna be worse. When you crit you recover like 6 stress points and maybe the characters around you recover this too but when you take a critical strike from the enemy your character gets something about 11 stress points and the people around can get that too. But you can land a critical heal, which heals more and also recover stress.

Just like [b]This War of Mine [/b]did, Darkest Dungeon changed my mind about dungeon games. You are familiar with one hero killing 1000 enemys, burning villages, killing dragons alone... They are just fairy tails. In Darkest Dungeon every battle is hard, since the tutorial. You learn to respect and treat every enemy as an enemy, not some loot bags. The encounters can be a full team with a tank, one melee damage dealer, one mage with stress spells and a shaman with heals and buffing skills. The tank can guard the others meanwhile buffing his own defense, the damage dealer can bleed and hit hard your entire team, the mage will do stress damage to the entire team and the shaman will heal the tank meanwhile buffing the damage dealer.

You have to buy food and torches in the beginning of each quest, so you will learn how to spend money properly. I had to dispense some good characters because they went insane and I could not afford 2 weeks of treatment for them. You will have to make tough decisions, just like [b]TWoM[/b].

The funny part of the game is that you can make the game harder playing with less level of lights from torchs expecting to have better loots. Thank you but no.

I gotta say, [b] try this game. [/b] You never played anything like this before. If you are a casual gamer see some videos on youtube and stay out of this but if you are hardcore... You just found where to spend the rest of your year.",True
"Legend Of Zelda: Zelda's Adventure often comes up when u talk about this sort of 2D videogames, however i see no resemblance. This game is a Kirby more then anything else. The gameplay in this game is very well made and satisfying, however there is a lack in enemy types in the game, especially when u compare that to a very similar game, Mario Tennis which has 20 whole different types of enemies, which complete trumps this games enemy varation. The cool minigames or whats called the ""Proving Grounds"" are a hype inclusion, but are 100% impossible to complete for most people and the rewards are basically usless. The story has a lot of lore, but the player should have more reason to read that lore, so its not so easily missed. Its a really well made story, it resembles any Mario game actually, were u gotta go save Mushroom Castle, but instead its about stopping the event from ever happening, however this game does it way better actually. Its about saving two counties, races, or something like that, from war and calamity ganon. The art from this game is some of the best when it comes to board games.

But one detail destroyed all the fun: moving the car while in battle:

- correcting such routes takes time, since they need ti finish their grid contrained move

These 3 points greatly affect: 
- enemy manual chasing (as they always have longed raged wepons, it will be your job to manualy chase them while they fire back at you)
- avoiding scout cars (the ones you control) insta-death (loose 3 games in a roll beacuse of bad pathfind)

- When you right click to move, draw the path it will try to make, so it can be reassigned before it's too late.

"       I'm sure this has already been stated countless times, but consider this another review to perhaps draw in another prospective player driven away by this game's infamous reputation on the internet. THIS GAME IS NOT BAD! I would even consider it great by my normal standards.

       There are many qualms gamers seem to have with this game (although I personally believe that an overwhelming amount of negative feedback comes from hate bandwagoners) including soul memory, similar bosses, uninspired/disconnected area design, broken hitboxes, and enemies that attack in droves and utilize cheap movesets that give players little to counter. Of these, I would agree with the critiques on area design, although only slightly. I've personally found that although the interconnectedness of DS1 is rather lacking in this game, areas are a blast to explore and a marvel to imbibe on their own. Take Shrine of Amana for example: A somewhat linear area hated by many for the nature of its enemies and the plentiful pitfalls wherever one may go. The atmoshere was somber and relaxing, however, and the stone pathways, ancient white-washed structures, and glowing blue plant life set it apart from any other place I'd ever seen in a Souls game. 
       As for the others critiques, I believe it comes down to personal preference more than anything else. Many souls veterans would agree that the souls games are less about outright teeth-grinding difficulty, and more about learning from your mistakes and always proceeding with caution. In my opinion, Dark Souls 2 is no different in this regard. Enemies may attack in larger groups and initially appear to be overwhelming, but areas almost always have ample room to navigate and outsmart the A.I. Concerning broken hitboxes and repetitive bosses, a slew of giant knight-type guys is nothing new (looking at you, Demon's Souls) and I only truly encountered issue with the Pursuer, who's glowing-sword tracing attack always seemed to find its way through my torso. It IS true that many enemies will continue to track the player mid combat animation, but this frequently makes them easy to exploit for a quick backstab more than anything else.

Finally, we come to the overall presentation of the game. The graphics aren't anything groundbreaking, but aren't hard on the eyes, either. Massive, sprawling vistas that burst in out of nowhere in Souls fashion are ubiquitous, and although the movesets of many weapons have been changed (some for the better, some for the worse) the introduction of useful dual-wielding and power-stancing, as well as combat that feels strangely smoother than DS1, more than makes up for shortcomings in that facet of the game. Altogether I would probably rate this game a solid 8.5/10, perhaps even a 9 if we're talking about this particular version, since it includes improvements to questionable item and enemy placements, as well as 3 phenomenal DLCs. Most importantly, I would recommend individuals stop bashing this game simply because it failed to live up to its predecessor in every possible field, especially since it was developed by a different team, and thus was destined to have many differences.

"This is great, probably one of the best ARPG's out there honestly. It feels impactful, you feel powerful when you pick up strong gear and you can customize your build pretty wildly however you want and it'll turn out well. There's also good amount of legendaries, cool sets etc.

The good thing is, it isn't one of those ARPG's where a single item increases your dps tenfold, but rather all your gear combining into something awesome which is how it should be.

You can also reset your skill/mastery tree whenever you want (this is probably one of the best QoL features ever), enchant your gear, socket gems or re-roll sockets, sell items to an NPC and best of all being able to gamble for gear. (There could be more NPCs, or more features I have yet to access, I've only finished the first act.)

I'm almost certain that the person that made this game, knew what they were doing and knew what people playing a game would want and in that regard this game succeeded.

It's only real downside at least to me, is no multiplayer. Multiplayer is an insanely important factor for an ARPG to have. Being able to share your loot with friends, showoff how insanely strong you are and play through the game together, is one of the greatest things in an ARPG. So for me, if I were to ever give it a rating, having no multiplayer would lower it quite a bit.

Also, the wild amount of loot is really 50/50 for me. I enjoy obtaining vast varieties of different gear, weapons and items, but it doesn't feel as satisfying to get gear when you're fed a gargantuan amount of it. Within 5 hours of gameplay, at level 37, I had a full set of legendary gear I was somewhat happy with.

"This review is being posted amongst a barrage of negative reviews that really have nothing to do with the developers but instead with the publisher who made a controversial business decision to pull the newest title by 4A in the Metro series (Metro Exodus) shortly before its scheduled release in favour of an 1-year exclusivity deal with the Epic Games Store. Don't let this controversy overshadow Metro 2033, this game is worth your time and money...


Metro 2033 is a post-apocalyptic first-person shooter that oozes atmosphere, it's a linear narrative driven experience that has enough exploration to feel like you're not on rails, the game does a good job at changing up locales from the claustrophobic metro subway tunnels to the derelict and almost inhospitable surface.

"[h1]This game is simply put amazing, if you even have thoughts about getting it then I advise you to get this game, it has some growing pains and some iritable gameplay mechanics but it's quite easy to get past that [/h1]. - R34CT10N 74/100

Now for the full review: 

EDIT: With the new expansion on its way, or would wait until the first portions arrive (Being moons) before purchasing.

I bought this game on Saturday the 25th of July and have already played around 20 hours of this game, this time has given me a very nice view on the game mechanics as well as a lot of time to explore and I did NOT get very far at all.  The game is pretty fun for a casual gamer, a very very fun for the hardcore gamer.

b] The Good![/b

This game is extremely fresh and has a lot of new gameplay mechanics that have been added to the elite series. Combat is really fun and enjoyable and if you're just buying the game for the combat you're probably looking at around 30 to 40 hours of continous gameplay however if you're looking into trading and doing the quest and missions then you're looking at 200+ hours and exploration, combat, upgrading, wishing you had more money, doing assassination mission, dying, dying again, exploring, trying to trade, failing at trading, and so on and so forth. This game is expansive, the galaxy is in a 1:1 ratio and takes several hours to get end to end. There are alot of updates as well (Most recent being the power play) The only problem is that it's addicting...

b] The Medicore[/b

  While I will wholeheartedly recommened this game, there are some not-so-good features and while I expected some of these thing to be fixed, some of them are just gameplay mechanics that it seems the devs have overlooked. 

My first complaint with the game is the quest/mission system and how certain mission aren't as fluid as others, the transport missions are great if you need some quick cash especially if you go further away from your strating system but the risk doesn't justify the reward, I did 5 Transport mission, all paid around 50,000 CREDITs and I got scanned once, ONCE! and once I got scanned the only thing that happen was a 2137 CREDITs fine, I understand this but it feels cheap money, I really wish I was interdicted once and pulled out of FSD and some pirate just tried to steal my cargo JUST so I could feel like I earnt my 50K, it really feels weird and sort of empty however I do belive this is something that will get added later as it seems the devs are going to try and add more detail in.

My second complant is with the assassination mission, unlike the previous Elite games you aren't given a time your target will leave a certain station nor are you given a certain place your target maybe or even when the will arrive in another system all your given is one thing and one thing only, which system it will be in. This is really annoying for me as I found my self looking around at any signal source and wasn't even told that the only place to find them was at Unidentified Signal Sources' which the game does not tell you. Again I feel that this is a depth issue and not a game breaking problem, however it is close, I really am waiting for them to add the ability to stalk my enemy and find the right chnace for me to kill them, I also really want the ablity for Federal Security Vessels to come and find me and kill me because I was trying to kill someone. Devs if you're reading this, this needs to be added, stat.

My Final complant is the lack of detail in the mission/quest screen. I picked up a mission to find trade data for someone and wasn't even told what type of signal I was looking for, this lead to my first hour being me trying to find something and LITTERALY dropping out every chance I get to have a lot around. I didn't get it in the end and this was a problem for me.

b] The Bad![/b

This is where I would explain to you the arguments against this game, but I can't find any,  the graphics are pretty, the OST is amazing, the SFX and shaders are super, everything feels like it's fitting in place....as long as you have a HOTAS and you are not playing with a mouse and keyboard. I started playing this game with a mouse and keyboard, I played my first 80 minutes of the game with them, then I ran and dug out my entry level thrustmaster T-Flight HOTAS that I bought back in '08 (Still make and sell them) I then change my settings and wow! this is so much better. Yes this game is worse WITH a mouse and keyboard and feels VERY clunky with one, please do your self a favour and get the same one I used during this time (Upgrade to the Siatek x55 WAY more expensive) you'll be doing yyourslef a favour.


h1] Conclusions[/h1]

This game is amazing, from the graphics to trading it is simply put mindblowing, it is however let down by lack of detail in mission and the requiement of a HOTAS, however minor these are problems that need adressing BEFORE it's perfect. This game is ONE HUDNRED PERCENT worth the 50 EUROs (40 GBP) that I put down for it and it's probably worth more.

"I really enjoyed this game. It's really something. It's a treat. I honestly don't know what to say about this to be honest. It will make you happy. That's for sure.

Cons are numberous though. It's short. I beat it in 2.7 hours and I didn't ignore the extra hidden achievements. I missed them because I missed one little part or didn't follow through correctly, but I still did the right things here and there which added a little amount of time. Still short.

The first two chapters, or at least the first chapter and half the second is kind of slow. It's a lot of just going in one direction without much interaction.

The final chapter mechanic is not that great because going upside down is lame. Still playable and entertaining but not how I would have liked to leave the game.

This game is absolutely beautiful and sounds amazing, especially when you can start singing. I think this game is worth every dime, even at the low playtime (unless you go for the acheivements that you can miss easily, but I still think it'd be like 4 hours or so?).

"As I cross the 1000 hour threshold, I thought I'd write a quick review. 

[b]Simply put, this is one of the best and most addictive games ever.[/b]

The gameplay and replay value is extremely high. The elements come together almost perfectly in multiplayer action. Accessible and rewarding for new  players while ever-challenging for experienced players. 

Revenge can be had quickly. This fuels your addiction. The vibe of the game is humor rather than death and destruction. Even though it's nice and gory, with limbs and blood flying everywhere, it's not sickening violence. It's not obscene violence or dark and disturbing, but actually is just good fun. 

The genius of this game is in the timing required to block your opponent, the attacks and strategy used in battle for your chosen character is only limited by your willingness to learn and perfect your timing and anticipation. It amazes me that they've pulled off a first person slasher game, where the weight of your sword is a huge factor in landing that killer blow. 

Edit: eventually had to uninstall and say bye to this game due to the offensive idiots infesting the Australian server where I played. Got tired of the constant ""comedy racism"" and other vulgar trash talk. They were using the game as their personal platform for racist, sexist, hate-speech trolling. They claim ""it's a joke, it's ironic"" etc, but of course that's their excuse. That excuse gives them a fake green light to continue. So I had to leave. What they should do is bugger off to their own website and swap racist memes all day long. Why should others have to put up with that crap?",True
"I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an action packed, platformer RPG that never gets old, no matter how long you play.

And before you know it, you've been awake for 40 hours trying to make a cellphone. You'll want to clear your schedule before playing, because this game is by no means a game where can hop on for a half an hour and call it quits!",True

"I picked up the game just for VR. I'm using an Oculus Quest with a link cable, and it's little janky but it's pretty neat. You have access to everything, but there's a few issues like no smooth turning option or button remapping, and you're going to have a hard time communicating with other players if you play online.

After playing for a bit over the last few weeks, here's what I have to say:

Loud:
Police assaults quickly devolve into long stretches of pure chaos and crazy bullshit and it's absolute joy to play. The base game is already pretty fun with the incredible soundtrack and blistering pace, but actually being in the middle of the action with a legion of armed and armored cops swarming in from all directions while you're frantically trying to complete objectives... man this stuff is ace. There's not a lot of VR games that transition well from flat-screen, but I'd say they did a pretty good job here.

-Get a laser sight.
-ADS works by holding the weapon at eye level. If you don't want to use this mechanic that much, invest in skills that increase hip fire accuracy.
-I strongly recommend using weapons with a high ammo pickup rate. Trying to manage your ammo in the middle of the action is extremely difficult in VR.
-If you're prone to motion sickness, you may wanna pass on this. Even in VR, the game is very fast.

Stealth:
Goddamn, I hate Murky Station. My fucking knees hurt, yo.

-Keep your finger off the trigger.
-Mind your hands. In VR, the weapons have collision. You might accidentally hit someone or break a window.
-Do some squats.",True

"This game is bad. Story is boring as fuck, characters are boring as fuck, ESPCIALLY LEANNA. FUCK YOU LEANNA BORING AS FUCK.

For melee combat, you have a light attack and a charged attack. Light attack is literally useless, NO REASON TO. Early game, enemies are fucking sponges and need A LOT of attacks, late game everything dies with 2-3 shots, fucking lame. Combat is fun when you sidestep your opponent to land a charged attack, but otherwise its bland as fuck. It's more useful to KICK your enemy than hitting him with your sword.

Seriously, there is a huge emphasis to kicking your opponents and throwing shit at them. Spiked walls scattered EVERYWHERE (why orcs, why?) for you to kick people into, barrels and crates everywhere for you to throw them at the enemies. And they call it 'using your environment'. Yeah, sure.

So many fucking bugs. Leanna kept getting stuck for me after getting off a fucking boat, i had to reload a couple of saves before to get it to work.

You have a demon form later on in the game. ABSOLUTELY USELESS. You have a semi-powerful charged attack but no defence. At higher difficulties, you'll just end up getting slaughtered after killing 1 guy. Way more reasonable to stay with your shield.

The first couple of levels are awesome, lush green environments, great open spaces. The rest however, are boring as fuck dark corridors and caves. Bullshit.
The only good thing about this game, is the rope bow. That's pretty cool.

It really seems like the only people who like this game are hipsters. And the classic nostalgia ( i played it when i was younger and it was awesome!).

I restarted the tutorial four times hoping it would be a temporary glitch, or if it was due to where I positioned my buildings.

I try a different career, assuming what I just started uses a DLC I don't have, and I'm met with the same screen.
So... even though I bought the Deluxe edition, it seems I can't launch a career because I simply don't have all the DLC of the game? How shit is that?

"I have enjoyed all the Siralim games, and as expected, the latest version is the most polished and establishes the highest quality of life improvements for the player.

I love a good grind, and Siralim allows you to simultaneously grind across multiple dimensions (creature power, creature collection, team composition, artifact system, spell gems, character perks, probably some other things I'm forgetting or haven't encountered yet) all in search of the most ridiculous, synergistic, dominant party you can come up with across a vast breadth of creatures with unique traits.

Traits are the special characteristic that vary with each creature type (of which there are 700). Defining your party composition is really about finding an effective combination of traits among the creatures in your party. The fact that you can find/craft artifacts which can also have a creature trait (which means each of your six creatures in your party can really have two traits, one innate and one from its artifact) is a brilliant way to add another layer of possible party combinations. Layer on the quest for the perfect spell gems for your strategy, and you find a game which feels very structured but also offers nearly uncountable possibilities.

In addition, being a father of a newborn little dude, I also love the turn-based dynamics, the opportunity to roll at a casual pace, and the ability to play with only one hand on the keyboard.

Apologies if I got to rambling. Bottom line, if you like meaningful grinds with steady progressions, creature collection, and party composition, check this game out.

"It's like a historical fiction novel by Bernard Cornwell except interactive. You get to live the life of a nameless peasant that survives the massacre of his home. There is a pretty linear main story arc you proceed through but you have tons of freedom in how you approach any given quest or in choosing what quest to work on. You can play as a fine upstanding person, or a sneaky rogue. There isn't any kind of magic though. Well, except for alchemy which does offer some mildly magic like effects. The leveling in this game is not great, relative to other RPG games. They're somewhat limited by their adherence to realism. There isn't a complex skill tree that you can craft different builds from. You're going to be chopping people up with melee weapons and mastering the unique melee  combat system offered in this game. So gaining levels in this game is kind of a meh experience. What keeps the interest is progressing Henry's adventure and becoming good at the combat.

There's very good voice acting all throughout. Every single npc interaction is voiced. I guess it's part of the focus on immersion. There is no third person view in this game. You don't get to get outside of Henry the blacksmith's son. And you don't see walls of text appear when communicating with a cabbage vendor.

I really the hardcore gameplay mode. Not only does it make the combat harder, it makes navigating and finding things harder. You don't get to see your position on the map. You don't get any kind of hud pointer telling you were to go. You don't even get a compass. You do stuff like look at a map, note landmarks. find those landmarks around you to fix your position. Then  you can plan out a route by noting paths marked on the map and try to follow those paths in the world. Or maybe you get lost and have to figure out which way is north by finding the big dipper constellation, and from that the north star.

The game has a lot of depth in its systems, and it's a true rpg. There's lots of quests with multiple ways to resolve that can have different long term consequences to the story. While combat is a focus, it is possible to defeat the raider camps by poisoning their food, or maybe don't defeat them at all but just steal the bandit leader's spurs to get paid.

Last thing I'll say is do not neglect training with Bernard. You must train with Bernard to unlock the advanced combat moves. Sparring with Bernard is best way to safely raise your combat skills too.",True

"well how can i explane the greatness of this game i think ill start with the view,

Well Arma 3 is one of the best militairy simulation game and has allot of militairy type vehicles from cars to tanks to helicopters to jets and even VTOL'S (like a C-130 hercules) aldo the ground and air combat is great can the underwater combat be improved but it is there,you got boats a submarine and in CO-op games even underwater objectives,for the rest i can say that the helicopter flying is really easy to learn,if you want a bigger chalenge try the jet and UAV combat.

Just to say this game and the Dev team are great,they always add DLC'S of a minimum of 1 a year,But if you don't want to pay for those you can still test them out or play with them on some server, sometimes it will give you a overlay to remind you that you are using a DLC weapon,car,heli or attachments.

To say this game is a bit more expensive but it's worth it,surely will recommend it to everyone",True

"Sniper Elite 4 is by far the best in the series.  The visuals are stunning, the missions are thrilling, and the music is incredible.

The single player campaign has an excellent objective/map system in which you can sneak, stab, and snipe your way through semi-open world maps that are expansive vertically as well as horizontally.  As always, the bullet-time, x-ray, slow motion kill-cam shots are disgustingly satisfying, and the stealth kill animations are absolutely brutal.  The story is a little short, and the voice acting for some characters is better than others, but overall I would recommend everyone play through the campaign at least once.  The rail-gun mission was particularly fun and satisfying ending in a gorgeous and explosive finale of course.

Multi-player is it's best yet for the series.  The varying environments lead to fun, tense, and skillful matches that have your senses tingling and your hair standing up on the back of your neck when you hear an enemy creeping up nearby.  It's a great feeling to end up at the top of the scoreboard following a match, and it will definitely keep me playing Sniper Elite 4 even after I've finished the campaign.

In summary: Fun, violent, and beautiful.  9/10 for a delightful nazi killing rampage.",True
"7/2019
So to start, this game has been out for a few years now. I picked it up because it looked as if it could be a fun play through. The series has a well known past. Gore, blood, and Nazis. I guess I figured that when a new company picked it up, it would be more of the same. Wash, rinse repeat?

Well, the game could be fun. And I do plan to play it through. But man, this thing is hard to play. That's not to say that on Uber it's hard. I mean the development of the game is really bad. Frames are everywhere, it's capped at 60fps (frames per second). For a FPS (first person shooter), that's really bad. Most people who enjoy FPS need a way higher frame count. But the issue here is not the cap. It's not smooth. Frame drops like crazy. It makes the game very hard to play. The hitching is insane. This is uncalled for. It's offline, and I (and many others) are running this on very capable rigs. This just runs bad. Looked around on Google, and in steam and I see many, many discussions regarding this. Some say to rename files, some say to add console commands. This may, or may not work for many people. I have not tried any of this yet, because when I have done this in other games developed by them, it breaks other things. 

I would tell you it's just uncalled for today. It's a modern PC game. Running on modern hardware. This is not some windows 98 or DOS game running on modern stuff. I get it then. 

This seems to be a common issue with this developer. They may make a great game, but they make it run really bad on PC. Then they say how the PC community is great and they really want to make games for them. In the end, it seems to play the games you need to mod them. There is no reason to have to mod a game to run well when it's a current game on current hardware.",False

"I love this game. First of all, I'm a big fan of those RPG-Maker like games and this is just one hell of a good game. It makes me want to play the game over and over again to gain new paths, new endings, new reactions and the 'What if?' is always a luring voice in your head that makes you keep playing and once you finished it, you just want to do it again to see what will happen if you do it the other way. Always Sometimes Monsters is funny, real and yet surreal on the same time. Either you can be the hero or the anti-hero. Decide for your friends, your benefits or do whatever you want and send all of them to doom with choosing a way that would break friendships, relationships and futures. Nowadays most people always take the save way, this game shows what could go wrong or what you could gain if you choose the extreme or you do it the way our society does and keep things low. I really recomment this game. It's a fun, intense experience and for people who like to choose for themself it's a big hit. The mini-games are awesome, you have many things to do for a living, explore and meet interesting characters you just have to love, to hate or...well...sometimes you can't even judge a book at the cover. You have to think or let your heart decide before you choose and that is something most games can't: Make you think about the choices you did. The 'What if', regrets, fun in choosing..

"I was really excited to give this a try, normally Love city builders and this looked awesome, but after the first few hours its tuned out to be really simplistic yet complex in the wrong ways. So many times over the map it self would screw me over while I was trying to get the hang of basics.  The building maintenance occurs too often requiring many more launches to get things rolling.  
 
 My latest game really was a big bummer.  First I decided to get all starting resources under control. Had stockpiles of everything I could, Research was around 30% I was ready to bring some real people down. So I landed the Rocket and they shuttled over to the new dome. All is wounderful things are going slow and steady... wait.. whats this?? a metor hit my drone controler and my pipe to that dome??

"Pros: 
- The game is engrossing
- The occultic lore is really interesting
- There's a lot of replayability. 
-Trying to unlock new achievements is fun; this is the first game that I've become an achievement hunter for.
- The music is perfect for setting the atmosphere
- The art is really nice to look at

Cons. 

-Achieving even a standard occultic victory will likely take multiple hours a day over several days to achieve. Whether this is a problem for you depends on how much time you have to play video games. 

-Dragging the cards to their slots with a laptop pad can be a pain in the butt if you don't have the cards you need strategically set up close to the slots you need to put them in, which can be hard to accomplish thanks to just how many cards you'll regularly be using. I haven't had a mouse for a while so I don't know about that experience.

-Because of how long it takes to win the strict death mechanic is REALLY frustrating, especially before you learn how to effectively manage the different negative cards you'll be getting

- This may be just me but I couldn't figure out how to [spoiler] leave the Mansus [/spoiler] at first.

- I really wish there was a 'go straight to when the next timer runs out' button for speeding up the clock as it would speed up the game a lot.

- After a few rounds repetitively putting the same cards in the same slots for hours just gets dull after a while.

I personally love the game. I'll probably by some DLC. But it's hard to recommend to other people. I remember seeing a review were someone said they'd only recommend it to someone they know is really into esoteric Lovecraftian stuff, and I basically share the same sentiment.",False

"I did a review about this game and at the time i believed it sucked because of crashing issue and clipping issues.  Well after a few months of play I decided to update my review.  I bought a new computer that has more power to the system and it solved the crashing issue.  I believe my old computer just couldnt handle all the visual power the game was offering.  While I didnt run it on high it still had a problem with med and low settings.  My new computer handles ultra high perfectly.  

The game itself is beautiful in design but it still lacks any reall purpose excet go from server to srver building the biggest structures you can.  Thats basically all you do.  The different catagories are meanlingless because all end up being a regular building sim.  That aside the world(with the help of the new North expansion) makes the world a nice size but with all the people jumping on and making the biggest places and many of them it makes the world seem very small.  

The inclusion of a monetary ssytem would make this game more appealing with play owned shops and specializations that players can do.  Right now everyone can do everything which defeats the purpose of interacting to trade goods or services.information is the key on this game and you can find everything you want to know in a youtube video somewhere.

Ther eare to many servers.  There are hundereds of thousands of servers it seem with most only having 0 to 5 players on at a time.  A very few have over 15 at a time on.  Consolidate those servers so more have to get on one.

All in all I would recomend this game, the visuals are second to none, if you like build stuff this has a lot of tools to do it and the mods that are available are great but  I don't recommend them because it will crash the  servers.  I do think the addition of a economy and player professions would give the game more substance.

"If you ever wanted to get into visual novels or into Phoenix Wright but couldn't have the intended fun because of their bland interface, Danganronpa should probably be your first investigative visual novel. It makes you forget you're playing a visual novel, with it's whimsical characters, entertaining sprite display and camera play.
You don't just investigate and get done with it either, you gotta convince people that what you've found out is true in the Class Trial, a gameplay mechanic that is, to date, the best way to transcribe debating into gameplay: Pay attention to what people are saying, notice what's wrong with it and time your refutation. You even get to shut up Ad Hominems from particularly nasty or desperate characters.
Mechanics aside, Danganronpa introduces you to a confinement scenario that builds an entire world around it without you actually being allowed outside. This is the first installment in the Hope's Peak Saga and an introduction to a tale of Hope and Despair. The story is just outstanding and if you haven't been spoiled on major reveals, just take the opportunity to play it.",True

"CS:GO is a different breed of Counter Strike, but at the same time those who fell in love with 1.6 or Source will feel right at home with this version.  While this game doesn't offer the customization and years of community created content that previous Counter Strikes have, Valve keeps releasing content for this game to keep it alive.  The gameplay is fluid, the matches are competitive, and it's an awesome experience with friends.  If you've played the console versions of this game and were put off, please through that notion out the water.  This is the only version of CSGO.  Recommended.",True
"The game looked great, handled well, had nice gunplay, interesting vehicles, and more or less nailed the whole Godfather atmosphere and the late 40s-early 50s aesthetic. But that's it. The characters are shallow, they were annoying when they were trying to be likeable, the ""open world"" is a joke, the story just slowly implodes, and as the protagonist, you gotta fix it. 

It's a tough one for me, as Mafia 2 lands right in the middle. As an experience, it's probably worth it on a sale. But I gotta say, it's not something I'll remember for a long time.

"I bought this with some fear, having read several negative reviews but still curious to give it a try. 
I must say, I experienced none of the issues indicated by other users. It must be because the game has been extensively patched in the meantime, so it was with a relief that I played it. 
This game is what I always wanted Thief to be but it never was. I find the AI reasonable: they allow you some freedom of move without being excessively lax. If you raise an alarm, guards will keep their swords drawn and you'll have  a much harder time sneaking around. The abilities are very interesting and useful. Being invisible for a VERY short amount of time can get you through some sticky situations but you can't rely on it too much. The cloning skill is also useful but in the end, what you must rely upon is your skill at sneaking. And if you get caught, you're no fighter, so it's over.
So as far as stealth games go, it's a good game in my opinion.
Then there is the setting. Which is stunning. The idea of a city that is an immense tower stretching for kilometers around a world tree whose amber grants powers and vision is stunning, and visually very, very well rendered. There's some unique flavour to the visuals of this game that I definitely appreciate.
For me, it's a solid thumb up.",True

"Amazing game. The campaign is well fleshed out. All factions are equally balanced and provide a real unique set of differences that everyone can appreciate. Only draw back is in large scale fights trying to target individual enemy units when they are all bunched up can be quite frustrating.

-Might encounter some minor graphical errors.

Recommendations: allow a diplomacy option asking an ally to break war against another allied faction. Its strange being allied with 2 factions that are at war with each other.

Side note: i have noticed ppl mention its nearly impossible to get other factions to confed with you, patience is the key to that as reputation does matter, but so does the overall board control of all factions combined. I was able to get confed after turn 180+ There needs to be a clear indication that waring factions have a large advantage before small factions seem to confed up.

"I just finished the game and it was quite the letdown. It started off as pretty fun and atmospheric, but by the end the combat had gotten very tedious. The only non-humanoid, non-turret weapons are introduced in the penultimate mission and then feature pretty prominently in the extremely tedious, multi-stage final battle. The ending was the worst of all. The art looked cool and I love the music but narratively it was so anti-climactic and unsatisfying. If you're really finding the last few missions to be a dreary slog, it's not worth it to push on through. This is a 16(ish) hour game (my hours are up because I got up to do something else and left the game running by accident) which took me 4 years to finish because I have gotten either so bored or frustrated with it when I've tried to play. It's only really fun for the first few hours. I mostly agree with the majority of the negative reviews I've seen on here: the enemies are bullet sponges by the end, the weapons are inaccurate and the story squanders and interesting premise and characters' potential for any meaningful development. I feel like I did get my money's worth for this game, but I've gotten far more mileage out much better turn-based strategies like Invisible Inc., Into the Breach and a myriad others. 

By the way, here is a tip if you are struggling in the late game: If you find your characters are getting habitually KO'ed in combat, it's usually because you're playing the game in a fun way- spreading characters out and trying to flank the enemy. This strategy is likely to wipe you the more wide and open the space is because your characters cannot shoot for shit. This becomes especially apparent in the last 2 or 3 missions. You would think a bunch of people with rifles would benefit from more space to fight in but it's actually the exact opposite! Your best strategy is to draw the enemies back into a narrow corridor where you can funnel them single file into your fire/melee. All of the opponents who can move will blunder straight ahead, never thinking/able to open an alternate route of attack, and they will die one by one while only putting up a minimum of fuss.

Only play this if you are really, really into turn-based shooters and want a break from whatever else you're otherwise playing at the moment. Now I need something else to scratch the science fantasy turn-based strategy itch, so I'm off to play Mechanicus next!",False

"I can't even say how disappointed I am.

After playing EHM 2007 years ago I was really looking forward to this game. The improvement was however nearly none. But as this is something that I won't forgive to other game, I made an exception.

Game is still fun to play, is relatively realistic. However is buggy as hell. It happend me three times now that because of some error I lost my progress of many seasons. Can you imagine my dissapointment to play I don't know, tenth season and now all the progress is lost? And I started to save it on three diferent save files, however this last time even loading older save file won't help.

I am so sorry, but after 300+ hours of playing I am done with the game. If you are considering to buy the game, don't. Save money and time and go manage some amateur hockey club, it is way less frustrating.

"The changes that were made in comparison to previous titles are done very well.

Love the environment, this game looks absolutely amazing.
The combat system took some getting used too, but after a couple hours I got the hang of it. And haven't had no problems what so ever.
Also I'm a huge fan of exploring and collecting, and this game had a nice ballance to both. So it does'nt feel like a chore when trying to get every little thing in the game.  

I definitely recommend this game to AC fans and also anyone who loves exploring in games.

"If you looking for fun + amazing stories + crazy characters with their dialogues + badass weapons and equipment, this is the game for you. 6 hunters for you to choose, each has individual skills with multiple play styles. DLCs are extremely fun as well.

I recommend you get all the story type DLCs. For maximum fun and maximum level

"This game is awesome from someone who has never played any other monster hunter before. I love the feeling of progression that the game gives, as you kill more monsters you can create more weapons and armor from their parts. If you are buying it in 2021 like I did, be aware that the game will give you the defender armor set at the start of the game that pretty much makes you unable to die. Take that as you want to; if you don't want as much of the grind and just want to steamroll through the game on easy mode, use it. Not using it definitely makes the game more challenging because you don't have endgame loot at the start of the game, but that also makes it fun because you actually have to worry about getting hit. Anyways, great game and looking forward to playing more",True

"So, uhh... where to begin.

Okay, I liked this game, yeah.

PROS
• Great music, when it's not being drowned out by the obnoxiously-loud sound effects.
• Probably the last good Sonic game with a worthwhile plot you can care about and be invested in. Sonic and everyone else feel like real characters instead of just Baldy McNosehair quip machines like in every other game post-Unleashed.
• Interesting physics-based movement, playing with momentum has an insane skill ceiling and I never felt like I was even getting close to mastering it. Basically everything the Boost games stripped away, while I can't defend it, is still really interesting to mess around with. 
• The Cutscenes

CONS
• Way too skill-demanding for a game with such sloppy controls and camera.
• Seriously, the camera just does whatever it wants. Sometimes you will have no say about its position.
• Some of the later levels are just grueling. Knuckles levels are cancer and Tails levels give you tinnitus.
• The Cutscenes

I've made a few new characters since I started playing in 2013 (I think?) and started again with a few friends earlier this week. The main story absolutely holds up, and it's fun just to play solo. The dungeons are pretty good, I think they start out way more engaging than the early dungeons of FFXIV. It's a very fascinating MMO with engaging quests that shine when they go beyond fighting enemies and challenge you. The dialogue and voice acting are very high-effort--comparing to FFXIV again, XIV is partially voice acted and has no good voice talent at all until 4.0, while this game really hits the ground running. My only advice is to run it in directx9 because 11 on Windows 10 has a lot of crashes and lag for me and the people I've been playing with.",True

"Update 5-17-2016:

Everything I've said about this titel still holds true besides the optimization. The game runs quite smoothly now on max settings.

I now give this game a thumbs up for one and only one reason - VR Support.

So if you have an Oculus Rift or HTC VIVE and like racing titles - this one will not disappoint you. 
As it stands today, it is the only racing title available on the Vive and even with the wonky physics, subpar FFB and horrible sounds is the most immersive among all the other sims. You actually feel as if you are behind the wheel while surronded by nothing but the car and track.

If you don't have an Oculus or Vive then my negative rating still stands (unless of course you like arcade racers)

-----------------------old review below-----------------------------------------


Pros: Decent graphics
         Nice car selection
         Nice Track Selection
         Weather effects are nice

CONs: mediocre physics (not a simulator in any way shape or form)
           Weak FFB
           No Triple Monitor support (this is the reason for the negative review - the other problems I could live with)
           Bad optimization (this game is not as advanced as some would like to believe and uses way more resourses than games with much more to offer)
            Many bugs (are currently being addressed - so we'll see)

Feel like I jumped the gun when I preordered this game. I was under the impression that this was supposed to be a  simulator and being such would include triple monitor support and decent FFB. In it's current state it is nothing more than SHIFT 3 with a different name. I may be happy with this game if I had it for console or only used a single screen with a gamepad to play, but this is not the case. 

So if you are  a  console player or use only 1 screen with a controller and like arcade racers this is a good title for you.

If you have thousands of $$$$ invested in highend video cards / overclocked processor, dashboard setups and triple monitors. This game is sadly a waste of all that equipment.

There are plenty of great sims out there - this is not one of them",True

there are two kinds of mods that you'll find in the fan forums; mods and scenes. scenes are general scenarios, such as a base assault or an entirely redone campaign. mods are, well, mods. factions, weapons, you name it. someone even made a filter to make the game dark and gritty, and someone made tiberium from command and conquer.

Unmapped Lands 2: this scene is very simple to play, but it can also get very long the longer you play, because the AI gets so much gold that he simply never runs out when he's attacking you. there's a manual in the thread for how to play the games.

"If you don't know, let me start with giving this tiny piece of information: Sleeping Dogs was actually supposed to be the third installment in the True Crime franchise, called ""True Crime: Hong Kong"". Although I tried so hard to love True Crime, I eventually realized that it's not my cup of tea. It was actually good for them to scrap this idea off because Sleeping Dogs feels like another game on its own, surpassing True Crime in every possible way, basically including an impressive story and diversive gameplay.

You step in the shoes of Wei Shen, an undercover HKPD detective who is tasked with infiltrating and bringing down Sun On Yee - a very powerful Triad organization reigning in Hong Kong. To admit, the story has some easily predictable twists, but the story still comes out as one of the strongest suits of this game. This cut-throat, dog-eat-dog story has a satisfying finale, but something about the ending still seems cheesy to me: SPOILER ALERT! [spoiler]It's kind of ridiculous for Broken Nose Jiang to let Wei off the hook after acknowledging his true identity as a cop even if Wei was a great help on her journey to take over the Sun On Yee leadership.[/spoiler]

Although they share the same formula, describing Sleeping Dogs as a ""straight GTA rip-off"" is not fair at all. The atmosphere and open world created for Sleeping Dogs is astonishing and the developers at least tried to do everything they could to make sure that Sleeping Dogs is distinguishable from GTA and its clones. Let's start by hand-to-hand combat. You'll be busier with your fists than you'll be with your trigger finger because hand-to-hand combat is the main core of this game. Hand-to-hand combat already feels unique even by the beginning of the game, and you can improve the experience more by unlocking new moves (like leg breaking, arm breaking, stun moves, combo strikes) by getting Triad XP or going to the martial arts club. Gun fighting is way less emphasized compared to hand-to-hand fighting, so it's not the best selling point of this game but it is still fun though (Vault Shoot, everybody).

Speaking of Triad XP, the missions reward you with Triad and Cop XP which give you some special perks for leveling up. Both Cop and Face XP (which is efficient in a lot of ways, for instance buying new clothes and vehicles) are easy to level up but Triad XP is a little bit troubling because once you finish the main story, there's very little to do for leveling it up (there are few side quests that can boost your Triad XP, so you generally end up replaying the missions for getting the max Triad level).

The game may not be that rich in terms of side quests, but they still manage to keep you busy for a long time: Going for 100% completion takes about 48 hours, which is noticably fair. The side quests include street racing, debt collecting, stealing cars, hi-jacking security vans, doing favors (which kind of works like GTA IV's Random Encounters, but shallow in context). Praying at health shrines boosts your health bar, and opening lockboxes sometimes rewards you with unique clothes. Oh, and you can also bust drug dealers as a free-time activity which works like this: First, you clear a street corner off the thugs, then you hack the camera. After that, you use your survelliance system to identify to drug dealer and command your fellow officers to arrest him. Busting drug dealers was probably my top favourite side quest.

Definitive Edition comes with two distinctive story DLCs, namely A Nightmare in North Point and Year of the Snake - they add approximately six more hours of gameplay. To be honest, A Nightmare in North Point becomes pretty boring after the first 15-30 minutes because the game is lacking in extra content and it's just about kicking ghost and demon butts. Both DLCs do not live up to the glory of Vanilla Sleeping Dogs, but Year of the Snake is the better one. In Year of the Snake, you control Wei as a beat cop going after a crazy cult in the main campaign, and making patrol shifts as side quests. It also enables you to handcuff and tazer enemies when fighting them. 

The game has some few issues regarding the grappling/interacting button like: 
- The grappling button ""E"" doesn't work fine for me, switching it to mouse wheel did the trick though.
- For some reason, I can't interact with street vendors to buy food or clothes. Getting away from them or starting a fight can work. If not, reload the game.
- Wei sometimes refuses to get in vehicles because of the same reason. The solution is the same as above. 

The real question is ""Should there be a Sleeping Dogs 2?"". Absolutely. Sleeping Dogs has proven to be successful, interesting and innovative enough to deserve a second game. However, I think they should give Wei Shen a break here. As much as Wei is a great protagonist, going too hard on him would be ""watering him down"". I know that one of the distinctive features of Sleeping Dogs is that it heavily feeds on Chinese/Far East culture, but I also see good potential otherwise. What about a game set in 70's Boston focusing on Irish Mob? Or a Donnie Brasco-esque game with Italian Mob theme? An undercover cop cracking down on French Connection maybe? I think they're good enough to put in consideration and work.

"Very repetitive and not very involved. Played an hour and a half without failing any levels just by spamming the damage dealing abilities. The game is pretty much just a huge grind. Beat the adventures over and over for resources, use the resources to build a load of weapons, sell the weapons for money, buy some character upgrades, beat the adventures over and over, etc. 

There's apparently a story in there somewhere. Honestly I don't think it's unclear because of poor translation, I think it's just a badly shoehorned in story. As far as I could gather the story is basically ""your villagers are bias and there are lots of conspiracy theories."" Whether those theories are about the king government thing or a blacksmith maybe being a thief the writers seem to just want to make everything ambiguous for no reason. 

All in all, it's not a bad game if you want a management, auto-dungeon-run, grinding, loot gathering game. 
The 'clicker' tag doesn't really apply because there's not any gameplay that revolves around rapidly clicking something. Though I suppose it does help understand the grindy nature of the game. Honestly, I missed that tag when first looking at the game and probably wouldn't have bought it if I'd noticed it.",False
"Started playing the game, and realized there was no ""Save Anywhere"" feature.  Because I'm not some child who can waste hours of my life between save points, I found a mod at Nexus which solved my problem.

About 30 minutes into the game, reached my first ""Easy"" locked chest after getting lockpicks from my friend.  Using an XBOX controller, I attempted this minigame.  Four save reloads later, uninstalled game.  What utter garbage of a minigame, in 2018.  Unbelievable.

I experienced 10x less difficulty learning how to pick modern locks as a child in real life.  My patience for overlooking frustrating, short-sighted game decisions is almost non-existent these days.

Edit:  A year later I tried playing this game again only to find that I CANNOT avoid an enemy.  A F*CKING soft lock keeps me glued to enemies.  This game is a total trash fire.  F*ck you devs.  F*ck you.  When the main part of your d*mn game (fighting) is this atrocious, it is NOT worth wading through the rest of the sh*t.  Stupid f*cking people.

Despite this, I made it through 20 hours and the story seemed engaging.  HOWEVER I ran into game breaking bugs every 3 hours of gameplay.  Then I bought the Royal DLC Pack and ""A Woman's Lot"" completely made all my prior save files incompatible.  Just endless black loading screen if this DLC was Active.  At this point I said f*ck this game, f*ck Warhorse, requested a DLC refund from Steam, and uninstalled the entire piece of sh*t for the second time.  This is unacceptable.  The d*ckhole devs abandoned fixing problems with this game in favor of releasing even buggier DLC's that break everything else.  Money grubbing @sshats.  Never giving them another dollar for this or future game releases.",False

This is the first survival game that has been enjoyful for longer than a week.

Fall damage out of no where.
Terrible rubber banding at the start of a round when it's most important.
Wireshark shows insane datatransfer up and from their servers right before you land, and continues for about 30 seconds.
Perhaps this could be streamlined some how, or streamed over a longer time, or loaded in the count down warm up time.
Hackers do exist, it is annoying, but I luckily do not have much encounters with obvious hackers.  I have a decent rank in solo duo and squad FPP, so it's still enjoyable.
Having player community hosted servers that perhaps didn't reward BP/Rank but could have custom rules, join password.  would greatly add replay value and offload stress and costs from the official servers, without hurting BP.

you can break anything

"The game is well worth the price of 5 dollars. It is a rough gem (which is why it is worth the 5 dollars, no more no less). It is rough because first of all, there are grammatical and spelling errors all over the place, the localization is not complete, you can see Russian here and there which can be a pain for non-Russian speakers, second of all, there are multiple bugs that causes wrong string display and whatnot (nothing gamebreaking though), lastly, it doesn't really hold your hands and the game is not as visual as Democracy where everything is linked and you know the consequences.

It should be noted that having knowledge on the history of the USSR is extremely helpful for the game (it can sometimes even help you make decisions), not having any prior knowledge will cause you to get lost due to not knowing what an event is about or what the consequences are.

For a summary of the game: you basically play as a Soviet historical entity, replay the Fall of the Soviet Union and see if you can turn it around. You can choose several different approaches to the matter, reform the Soviet Union, go on a hardline path or go full on liberal. You can decide how to approach historical events (occured before the game's timeframe but can still use it to influence your stats) and current events (the events basically advance time a month at a time). The timeframe goes from as early as 1985 to as late as 1996, a total of 132 turns excluding historical events (where a victory scene will show telling you how you did). There are several numbers you need to keep track of: budget, science points, political power points, and loyalties. Budget is used to allocate around and make things run, science points can be used to unlock tech and ultimately win the space race, political power points can be used to export revolutions or enact reformation and loyalty ensures you stay in power (don't mess with the KGB or the military, those are quick ways to lose the game).

All in all, fairly interesting, nice replayability especially if you want to try out different idealogies.

很有意思的一款游戏，很便宜，但是物有所值。基本上的意思就是你被钦点“中央都决定啦，你来当(苏共)总书记。”，于是乎你来建设苏联特色[strike]修正[/strike]社会主义（你也可以选择走民主路线或者是共产主义路线）。

游戏是按回合进行的，每年12回合，一回合一个月，从最早的1985到1996年游戏结束（可以继续，但是1996年会给你评分）。游戏开局的时候可以选择玩历史事件（基本上就是选择有几个事件来决定你的初始数据）。游戏最关键的几个数据，钱，政治点数，科技点数，忠诚指数，自由指数，中美关系。钱是用来让鬼推磨的。政治点数可以用来实施政治改革以及影响他国。科技点数可以用来加科技，特别是对于喜欢科技取胜的（里面如果不废除和平号空间站的话，可以进行火星登陆）。忠诚指数包括克格勃，将领，知识分子和左翼右翼等等，时常注意好克格勃和将领的忠诚指数，这两个比较要命，太低的话容易被推翻。值得一提的是克格勃，克格勃很多时候都可以用来轻松帮你解决问题，但是比较耗经费，如果不给经费的话需要他们的时候他们就不会出动。自由指数可以用来让你决定往后的政治走向。至于中美关系，美国关系初期比较重要，不过玩的时候可以把美国政府推翻，一旦推翻美国政府，立刻会解锁大量的外交选项，比如统一两岸建立台湾特别行政区，让日本割让北方四岛以及让西欧诸国退出北约等等；中国关系不是很重要，但是到后期会有一些事件可以选择把海参崴还给中国等等等等，中国最大的好处就是有一个大大的市场，一旦开放就是可以拿来赚钱的，如果选择向中国开放市场，可以解决一定程度上的的轻工业不足（后面还可以向天朝出口军火）。游戏里面还需要注意其他苏联加盟国的忠诚指数（太低的话他们会分裂出去）还有极个别的有苏联驻军的国家（亚非拉同胞们）。如果一定想出口革命的话也可以，但是比较困难，比较耗金钱和政治点数，建议先照顾好东欧再说。

不过这个游戏翻译比较粗糙，不会讲俄语的可能会比较吃亏，游戏的英语翻译也是比较毛糙。玩这个游戏最好有一些历史常识，稍微了解一些东欧剧变的历史对游戏里面各种事件都会有所帮助。

你如果一定问我这个游戏怎么通关，我可以回答一句“无可奉告”，但是你们也不高兴，我怎么办？我就明确的告诉你这一点, ”人的一生当然要靠自我奋斗，当然也要考虑历史的进程。“ 你们啊还要好好学习一个。 曰..曰",True

The one downside I have for NieR:Automata is that it looks best with a computer that has a very, very fast CPU, and an incredibly powerful graphics card.  This is not a game for those with budget or mid-level computers.

I do recommend a ""variable DPI"" mouse as some parts need precision and others don't.

NieR:Automata is like nothing (yet also everything) before, and I would buy a hat and eat it if anything ever surpasses it in its creativity.

NieR:Automata is both darkly funny and deep in the philosophical elements, so I also recommend having Wikipedia open in case some of its references need researching.  This game challenges the mind just as well and just as much as it challenges the gaming skills of the player.

"Ubisoft got it right this time... have played other FPS/RPG titles before and there always seemed to be something in the game mechanics, controls that felt unfinished or broken.  But so far the gameplay, graphics & audio all seem spot on!

This next point maybe a minor point to most but I am one of those weird people who like to use ""invert Y axis"", this was a feature that was missing from the last Ubisoft title I played and unfortunatley that stopped the game for me. I can't help it, my head is just wired that way! Thankfully there seems to be a full suite of control options to suit all the most quirky players.

I will says though that I have only played this in co-op mode so far and has been a blast. So cannot comment on how the game feels when solo and joined by NPC team mates.

"Reassembly is a ship building/fighting game akin to Captain Forever and Void Hunters from Funorb.com. The concept of building a spaceship to destroy hostile fleets is not new, but this game offers fleet mechanics that let you lead (and eventually build) armies to take over the world. The game's ""goal"" is really in your hands, as it's more of a sandbox game, like Void Hunters. I remember when I got this game last Chirstmas and spent 50 or so hours playing through it, after I misjudged it at first glance and replaced it with Transistor (or maybe it was Bastion, both good games). This game's also easy to mod, has a modding guide on its website, and sports a vast number of mods if you ever get bored of the base game.

I spent half of my playtime in the ship building menu/10",True
"This game is an absolute must in every Steam library. You could compare it to Minecraft, but that game focuses more on building and exploration in my opinion. Terraria focuses a lot on boss fights (over 20 bosses and mini-bosses vs. Ender Dragon and Wither). The game offers infinite replayability and is worth a lot more than its $10 price tag. This is the main reason why I am recommending the game; if there was a neutral option, I would definitely go for it.

However, despite the praise the game gets, it is wrong to call it a perfect game. Journey's End, Terraria's final major content update probably, has been on the disappointing side for me. Let's compare the game's major updates.
1.0 had 3 bosses and 1 invasion. 1 optional boss was added later on.
1.1 introduced 4 bosses and the Hallow.
1.2 introduced the Crimson, an alternate world evil to the original Corruption, as well as 4 new bosses and 3 new invasions. 1 optional boss was added later on.
1.3 introduced 2 bosses including the final boss, as well as 2 invasions.
1.4, Journey's End, introduced 2 optional bosses, one of which can offer a post-ML ""challenge"".

Now admittedly, you can't really add more content to your game when you've already introduced a final boss. But it is entirely possible to ignore most of the addons that have been added in Journey's End. I completed my entire Master playthrough without even acquiring a single item introduced in the Blood Moon event.

On top of that, fuck Master Mode. Re-Logic had promised a higher tier difficulty to Expert but delivered an overly inflated mess where most basic enemies will shrug off attacks like it's nothing whereas bosses have not changed at all. By the way, there is an easter egg with world generation where if you input the seed ""For the worthy"", your world will become 1 tier higher difficulty than Master mode. If you're reading this review without owning Terraria, you have 3 difficulties, excluding Journey mode, when creating a Terraria world. For your first playthroughs, choose the classic experience, as it offers a great balance. You can say it has a difficulty multiplier of 1. 
Expert mode multiplies every enemy's stats by 2; therefore having a difficulty multiplier of 2. It also revamps every boss's AI, making the experience interesting.
Master mode has a difficulty multiplier of 3. 
Master mode, For the worthy, has a difficulty multiplier of 4.

The reason I bring this up is because despite the insane x4 multiplier, ""For the worthy"" worlds actually offer AI changes to most bosses, making them harder to fight, whereas Master mode, an official game mode, does not. It's not like Re-Logic didn't know about this either: they added an extra accessory slot to Master mode to help cope with the artificial difficulty, as well as warn players IN ADVANCE that Master mode is [url=https://youtu.be/WX7MNOAE9FM?t=225]""a gamemode only for tryhards and not for casual players""[/url]. Basically they knew the gamemode would turn off many players because NPCs are bullet sponges that can't even be stunned with knockback.

The summoner class was also promised love in the update. Nearly all of his newly added drops are locked away behind low drop rates requiring you to grind your way to obtain them. The new whip mechanics force him to go dangerously close to enemies he should be staying away from, as well as not addressing summons only attacking enemies within screen range, whereas the ranged, mage and even sometimes melee class can all attack enemies that are out of screen range.

And the new final sword added to the game is way too overpowered for its own good. You can kill the final boss in less than 10 seconds with it if you really tried, in Master mode. There are no post-ML challenges able to withstand its sheer power, not even Pumpkin/Frost moon invasions that only summon bosses in their final waves. I'd expected an upgrade for the Terra Blade, a once called ultimate melee sword, item which you can spend up to 70% of your playthrough gathering resources for, only for it to be surpassed by the Influx Waver, a common 1 in 9 sword dropped by an invasion which takes less than 20 minutes to complete. (Final sword spoiler)[spoiler]Instead you can craft an item which will throw every sword that has been used to craft it to the player's cursor, passing through blocks, without a limited reach, not even with multiple monitors.[/spoiler].

Despite all these criticisms I still believe the game is worth your buck. I am really sad the game will end with a gamemode that feels unfinished.",True

"Was awesome. Now it runs at 3-7 fps and is unplayable. At first, playing on smaller machine, I thought something was wrong with the rig. Then I fired it up on my dual gpu X99 system and its definitely the games fault. A shame that Apogee, the once king of PC games, cant make a DX9 game run right at the present. I was hoping for a resurgence from Apogee. Dont think thats gonna happen

EDIT/UPDATE 1/10/17: reinstalled after reformat of SSD. Tried running both 32 and 64 bit. While 32 bit does run better it still has problems that really shouldnt exist. Perfect example, in the screenshot below a certain gun (that has a video screen that can be turned on and off) that causes FPS to drop (sometimes down to 5 fps) when activated. Right click, in place of ADS, turns on the montior attached to the gun. Doing so makes the game unplayable.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=839732793

Can the game be played without that gun and that function? Sure. But its not the only issue it has. Lightning in game and in the menu screen just makes the game itself flash rather than have the lightning effect translate. Other FPS drops happen for reasons I cant seem to figure out. Running it on its stock settings - which is a 1280x700ish is the only way I can get the game to run smoothly in both 32 and 64 bit. Ive tested it now with three separate video cards. Specs below

i7-5930k
16gb DDR4 @2400mhz, 2133mhz, and downclocked all the way to 1333mhz
GPUs tested: RX480, 290x Lightning (crossfire and single gpu), 980Ti Kingpin

980Ti tested with most current driver and AMD drivers tested with past 4 Crimson WHQL and 1 Previous Beta driver. The 980Ti had the lowest drop in FPS on the weapon alt-fire shown above. However, the lightning screen flash (and screen tearing as a result of the lightning) was more pronounced in 980Ti and the RX480 vs the 290x Lightning. But the 290X Lightning experienced the worst FPS drop with the gun with the monitor when alt-fire/ADS was activated.

In other words, no matter what gpu's I use I have to deal with areas in the game that make it run like it was made by a 1st time dev and not Apogee, one of the largest, trend-setting, publishes in PC gmaing history.",False

"This game is pretty darn cool. There are no enemies or allies. It's you in what feels like a surreal, impossible test chamber that goes on a long way. You can press Esc at any time to teleport back to the main room, where you have a little map that lets you pick which puzzle area you want to go to. The objective is to get different ""guns"" that let you take and place blocks. The guns look the same, but they are different colors, and those colors are hints to point you toward blocks of the same color, to let you know you can solve that puzzle now. Each new gun you get replaces the last, and you get them in order (doesn't seem possible to get them out of order if you tried).

There are a variety of other puzzles which are solved using the same methods, but each becomes a -piece- of another puzzle, sort of like solving one thing in a Portal test chamber doesn't get you out of the test chamber itself, but just gives you progress.

It still has its flaws of course, i.e. stuttering when using the batmobile or gliding over Gotham, but that was also present in the second game as well.

This batman game in the series is really good, now that I've gotten a chance to play a good portion of it. Some say the batmobile segments feel forced, but I find them a nice change of pace from the normal on-foot segments the other games had. All around, a really great game. If you're over this game's really rocky start, then give it another chance.

"Killing Floor 2 improved everything that it could from KF1. It's gorier and bloodier, which is all the improvements have gone besides overhaul on designs.

I thought the ZED redesigns were hit or miss. The clots face definitely looks like corey taylor's mask from slipknot during the late 2000s period, but otherwise fine. Crawlers, Husks, Cysts, Clots and Scrakes are some of the specimens whose redesigns I was okay with. Fleshpounds, Sirens, Bloats, Gorefasts and Stalkers, I think, aren't that well redesigned. I think the one that stands out the most is the Fleshpound's redesign, that went from a slender, hulking and intimidating brute to a roided freak.

Lots of new maps were introduced to freshen the locations, alas some favorites didn't meet the cut from KF1. I personally loved West London from KF1 and was slightly disappointed it wasn't officially brought back. However, thanks to the Workshop, it can be downloaded and played with again in all of the KF2 visuals. Other than that, I loved all of the KF2 maps. I think they were really developed, they bring out a lot of the theme and project the mood incredibly well.

The music choice for KF2 continues blaring the heavy metal sound, although it's obvious that not a lot of the industrial tunes from KF1 has returned. Just strictly metal songs from artists that scream and growl primarily for the lyrics, while the instruments play as hard as possible. It doesn't turn me off but, I preferred the mesh and mash of industrial and metal music together. To note, some of the music this game plays is old tunes you wouldn't have guessed. Example, Turn Your Back and Run from Demon Hunter is from 2002 and it's on a game released in 2015 that you would think would have signed or asked new artists to provide music for. Makes me wonder if there wasn't a lot was available which forced the developers to go back to older material. Either way, I'm good with all of that.

And that's where the line for what I like about the game pretty much ends.

I may be a level 25 of this perk, but I still hate the hell out of Gunslinger. This perk took almost everything away from Sharpshooter and focused on wielding dual pistols. I understand why in a way, but I haven't fully accepted it and I don't think I'm ever going to. Gunslinger spends way too much time twirling and flicking those damn pistols around than focusing on reloading faster in the heat of killing ZEDs. I also feel the reloading animations in general for Gunslinger take a little longer, despite having the speed perk for reloading faster, which I find funny that when I'm hit as Gunslinger, I reload in top notch speed. But for any other time? I casually reload, which is an inconsistency issue.

Sharpshooter was my max perk in KF1 and I felt like it was neutered in favor for Gunslinger. I feel Tripwire just fucked with the balancing and handling between the two classes. Because Sharpshooter is only restricted to so little than Gunslinger. The Handcannons (now Desert Eagles) for example, were once in Sharpshooter, but now they're Gunslinger and Sharpshooter doesn't get a single Desert Eagle in it's class but gets all the other pistols. I could go on but it'd be nothing but just reckless drivel. Case and point, Gunslinger can go fuck itself and the aiming for it is horrible because you're going to waste ammo on one side and feel like you hit with only one pistol as opposed to both of them.

The next thing I didn't like at all about the game is obviously the loot box system. I don't care if it's just skins, but expecting people to pay $2.49 a pop for a USB key to unlock a crate to get a random chance at an item is just milking people of their money. I don't know what to make of the dosh system they've got now but I just see more excuses to continue this system.

The gameplay does begin to feel like a grindfest, then again so was KF1. The only plus I can give here is that KF2 kinda gives more incentive to level up with. I usually don't care that much for the events being held, since it's just adding a new map, give the ZEDs a reskin and it's just back to shooting away over and over again. That may or may not have limited mileage for you but it did for me.

Again, KF2 improved and brought in a lot of things than KF1. I felt like a lot of steps were made forward, I did notice some more improvements were made since there's more weapons being introduced and game tweaks are made. This review would be twice as long if I was reviewing it a year and a half ago, since there wasn't much to have been awed about with this game.

But with every few steps foward, there's a couple steps back and those steps back could be critical. For the KF veteran, some liked what KF2 brought but most didn't. For those just jumping into KF for the first time, there might be a few things to enjoy of it. Though, it may be a turn off to see that it's a grindfest with a loot crate system.

I'm split on KF2, but inches towards not recommending because of the loot system.",False

This game completely blindsided me. I went into it expecting another predictable action/shooter game but the story in the singleplayer was so immersive and intense this game has easily become one of my all time favorites.

"Insanely Awesome and Fun game Highly Recommended

If you love top down shooters, serious sam, hammerwatch and chaotic shooting this game is for you.
It mixes the best of both worlds of serious sam and hammerwatch together makes a really great game especially for multiplayer.
Its way too easy on easy mode its recommended to start on normal to experience it as fun and challenging.

The game runs smoothly if you set the FPS at unlimited and its not really a issue since the game doesnt have extremely intense graphics.
However the retro art style of the game fits very well with nice colorful environments and character animations that are very pleasing to the eyes.

The classic serious sam weaponry and new innovative weapons ""not counting the sniper rifle"" they all work adequetely to cutting down mental's horde.
There is a depth of liveliness in the maps having non combatant units and breakable environment for added chaos.
There are more enemies implemented in the game including the the old cast of enemies discounting some old and adding new ones but it doesnt impact the entertainment factor of the gameplay.
The effort to make new enemies or non combatants wasnt necessary but the developers really wanted to give a new twist to impress the players with nostalgia with a hint of surprise.
The bosses are progressively more challenging and gives different twists on how you should fight them instead of straight up brute forcing with makes it a lot more fun to strategize and play with friends or touch up skills on singleplayer.
Even enemies have distinct different attack patterns that encourages the player to use different weaponry, prioritize targets and experiment with strategies with the more encounters that the player has with the enemy roster and weapons in the game.

There are no moments i can think of where i can consider an enemy placement or part of the game i can label as cheap of where it uses trial and error to just kill the player making a unnecessary death making artificial difficulty.
Just like when you can see the enemies outline behind the topdown view obscured by walls so you can see their locations.

There is a bit of a problem of the game's maps being really large without a map its a easy to get lost sometimes but with a bit of searching after a minute youll find the way to the exit surely.
There is a pace breaker mid game where it forces you to use the sledgehammer and takes all of your weapons away counting that the game gives fair amount of weight to your arsenal gives a sense of starting over again but in a fun way.
Every weapon that there is in the game has a purpose even the pistols are still useful for taking out smaller hordes of gnaars or kleers or even shooting weak ranged unit enemies from a distance while dodging making a good weapon for ammo conservation.
The sledgehammer was poorly implemented however because youll hardly find any incentive to use it when you can just use the pistols as they have unlimited ammo if you are trying to conserve ammunition for other guns including the fact you will fight many at once and in a melee scuffle with melee units you will have difficulties not getting hit and its out of the question for ranged enemies because you wont have any time to dodge the incoming projectile from such a close proximity when your trying to run towards them. Why would you use a more riskier lower damage output weapon when you can stay back and shoot with the pistols as a alternative for ammo conservation.

For the price of not even a full game you surely get a lot for your money its worth a buy even if your not a fan of serious sam or hammerwatch.

Best play the game with friends for the laughs and singleplayer for the experience and story. 
Either way the game is a awesomely crafted masterpiece, Its a breath of fresh air from modern games youll love it to the core.",True

"This is fantastic. What I like most about it:

A. It’s easy to pick up and put down. I don’t often have lots of time to play games. Missions can be completed over several sessions with efficiency because enemies won’t regenerate.

B. The pet feature helps with battle and for running errands. This contributes also to why you get better efficiency.

C. Character development is straightforward and logical. If you want to focus on magic, develop the characteristics for that. If you want to focus on physical combat, upgrade strength, etc.

D. Side quests are fun and don’t feel like time wasters.

"The game felt a bit rushed. Seemed like there wasn't a great intro to each race and a full yet gradual understanding of thier abilities. This would be a harder RTS to get into than many others if you didn't have previous RTS experience. Really seemed like each race needed their own full story. I loved the little unexpected part to the story but I think the campaign needed to be about 3 times the size to get a good feel and connect with each race.  Seemed like all 3 races were smashed into a campaign designed for one.

Still, really enjoyed the concept, enjoyed the somewhat unique play style of the goo. Hopefully if they do a Goo two they will expand each of the races story lines.",True

"This game is a strange one for me. To be honest, I played Dead Space 2 before I played this one, so my viewpoint may be slightly skewed. However, while I would not say that this game is as good as Dead Space 2, I would very much recommend it. It is a very scary game that keeps the player's attention the entire time, and while the gameplay gets rather repetitive, the story drives the player to the conclusion. Honestly, I would just recommend this game so that you can be informed when you play its better sequel. 6.5/10",True
"Awesome game! Too addicted lol, just finished xstep and wondering how people are doing demon levels :o",True
"Enjoying the game so far

Far cry new dawn is a enjoyable game but it has its flaws, far cry has issues that we see all too often with Ubisoft and that’s greed. I genuinely like the game but a huge portion of the game being a copy paste of far cry 5, it does have changes such as
-a crafting system for weapons and vehicles 
-a replay system for outposts with scaling difficulties
-a upgradable base which provides buffs
-a restructured/heavily reskined map
And a few minor other changes

Far cry new dawn isn’t bad but it shouldn’t be a stand alone game,in fact if they made this one of the far cry 5 dlcs i would be happier to pay 60 dollars, it feels like the devs are just trying to convince themselves that this is a different game and yet it’s not called farcry 6, as if they know it’s not a full far cry game.

My rant aside it’s still a fun game regardless of Ubisoft recycling strat to make more cash",True

"Surprisingly holds up pretty well for a game that came out in 2007, both graphically and mechanically. 

A little short and repetitive but it was ahead of its time for its non-linear progression, allowing the player to choose where they started after jumping out of the C47, and what order they completed the objectives in. Players are encouraged to look for flanking opportunities and explore the map for new weapons, health, ammo or in-game achievements.

The three tiered weapons upgrade system keeps the game interesting and fresh for a while, and makes you feel rewarded for all those super badass quadruple headshot streaks you've been getting.

The writing is sometimes a little cheesy and too gung-ho 'Murica for me, but sometimes the more gritty side of the war shines through. Then again, who plays a Medal of Honour game for the story?

The issue I feel is that I feel like the developers don't have a great sense of how to scale this out. It's hard to briefly summarize the various issues I'm seeing for a review; most every system looked okay at first blush but by the time I was working on the 4th and 5th scenario I found myself blurting out ""Really?

3rd, There's no create one way, everyone has there own building layout, floor planning and different guides to approach different aspects of the game

You can easily blow 80+ hours in solo, I would recommend running on beta opt in ""experimental"", the dev usually updates with some amazing changes constantly and sometimes absorbs some idea's from mods into the game itself.

"This game while being well made in the fact that each hero has a set story and thought out abilities that make each one distinct to play, there are major problems in the balancing on these heros in the competitive multiplayer matches. 

When  you first get the game you only have a few of the heros unlocked and have to get your account level up higher to unlock all of the other heros. The problem with this is that these heros are completely unbalanced, which makes the higher level players be able to dominate each match while the newer players that havent unlocked these heros to do nothing but die all game. 

Another problem is that while the heros for this game each have a large amount of lore and unique abilities to it, the maps have suffered from a lack of attention. In the competitive mode there is a total of 6 maps that you can play on. This would not be a problem if the maps were designed extremely well and had an entire set of stratigic spots you have to learn to utilize, but sadly its just a map that is identical on both teams sides. This leads the game to become extremely repetitive after only a short amount of time and leaving you to only care about the progression of your heros that are destined to either stomp the enemy team or die nonstop due to lack of balancing.

This game was great in concept, but has a lot of problems in it that lead to an unenjoyable experience. This game may still have hope as developers balance the heros and add more maps to the game, however at this time they are charging $60 for a game that still belongs in beta.",False

"If your looking for an rythem game like Audiosurf 1 but in VR your going to have to wait a bit longer and this is why:

1. there is very little coordination between the music rythem and the ""orb"" rythem. The ""orbs"" come at you at some points in rythem with the music but this is only an small amount of time when your not trying to deal with point 2. I suspect this is due to the game used a lot of Audiosurf 2 as it's basis and just put in VR as the menus are almost the same and they use Audiosurf 2's rythem system to do the ""orbs"" which is also not good compared to Audiosurf 1. (on Vive the youtube search glitchs out a ton as I couldn't even type as the typing screen flashed up and vanished each time)

2. CROSSOVER, there is a ton of crossover the higher you go in difficulty of where you end up with an sudden blue on the orange side and you miss it due to lack of gapping between the ""orbs"" or it's just too far. This could be solved by multiple modes like Audiosurf 1 however you are stuck with one mode and 3 different shields with 5 different difficulties.

3. Difficulty = more spam, yep just ends up being more ""orbs"" thrown at you with no link to the rythem or even an attempt to and so caused me to zone more on getting them rather than listening to the music rythem to get them.

4. Consistancy is nowhere, in Audiosurf 1 you can easily keep replaying an track and it would be the same everytime making it so that you could learn it and become better, that is in this to an small degree of where you see patterns but there is a lot of difference in each playthrough no matter what difficulty it is.

5. Easy to ""cheat""Final point is that you can just do one thing to make any of the modes easy and get 90%+ most of the time and that is to just hold up both controllers together infront of your self and boom everything hits them. There will be some at different angles which will require some movement but even if you ignore them and focus on holding them where the main amount is, your good. The Gladiator shield is the best for playing when you want to switch between this and atcually moving your hands around as they have the front bubble and then side bits which end up providing a lot of coverage when you need it.

So please don't get this thinking Audiosurf 1 in VR and it will be awsome....it's Audiosurf 2 with lazy mode put in to just ride on the VR movement and so for excersing in VR I recomend Space Pirate Trainer in stead as it's lazy mode is hide in shields but that doesn't progress you.",False

"(not a multiplayer review)

Pros -

* Guns feel really meaty.
* Destructible terrain.
* Neat storyline that makes me think of ""Total Recall"".
* The Vehicle content while simple, is smooth and enjoyable.

Cons -

* Repetitive 
* Awful 'stealth' elements that are mostly down to pure luck (""YOU'RE THAT MINER!"").
* Dull boss fights with gimped mechanics (The Capek fight is a real stinker)
* Voice acting is so-so.
* You die, you have to start again - no starting at checkpoints or at the start of the level. You have to use saves, which feels cheap.
* Inferior to even older FPS games such as Half-Life in almost every metric.

If you, like me, loved all those SNES games like Secret of Mana/Evermore, Terranigma, Zelda, you are going to love Secrets of Grindea. I like everything about this game! Graphics are neat, the combat is challenging but fair and feels pretty balanced across all specs. The bossfights are especially well designed. 

Story is pretty much what you'd expect. In the current beta there is already a good variety of scenes (forest, snow, pumpkin/spooky forest, cave, christmas, toy factory).

The dialogues are funny and enjoyable.

Really though, great game, you can really feel that 80's vibe in the game. Awesome soundtrack, you can really feel the 80's.

"I've already played through this twice and hit almost 100% completion, and I still find myself coming back to this amazing game.

Sleeping Dogs is a fun and action packed game with a brilliant story, and a great setting, although at some points it's mechanics let it down.

Story:
In Sleeping Dogs, you will control Wei Shen, an undercover cop tasked with infiltrating one of the Hong Kong triads and bringing it down from the inside. Wei himself is mostly a pretty forgettable character, and is not really shown to have many major flaws. He is tough and intelligent, and is essentially a perfect human, to a borderline unrealistic point. The story does not so much shine in all its characters as much as it does with its excellent moral conflict as Wei begins to be torn between whether or not he wishes to destroy the gang he works himself into, and in my opinion the story is one of the best aspects of Sleeping Dogs, and is a main reason I continue to return to the game. 

Setting:
While the map may be a tad small compared to many open world games, the way the streets are constructed, the sound effects, and the whole atmosphere really creates a rich setting which at least to me, never gets boring. Hong Kong is essentially a necessary part of the game due to its focus on the triads, and even though it's quite small, what they do have is done just right. While I haven't personally been to HK, a friend of mine has said that it does in fact look like the real city.

Graphics:
Sleeping Dogs is a beautiful game, especially considering how it isn't exactly too new. Some of the textures aren't too great, and often the characters seem to shine like they'd been polished, but leaving the games apartment and walking out onto a street at dusk just after some rain still never ceases to amaze me.

Music:
The original soundtrack in Sleeping Dogs, for me, isn't really anything special. It certainly isn't bad, it just isn't really unique enough to stand out. The radio songs on the other hand, really hit the mark, particularly in my opinion on stations such as Softly or Warp Radio. I never get sick of just driving around the city listening to the music.

Gameplay:
While Sleeping Dogs on the surface may look a bit similar to GTA, it is in fact quite different, something which is both a positive and a negative. On the plus side, Sleeping Dogs' hand to hand combat is very well done. While it is spammy if you want it to be, the range of options you have at your disposal means that the combat doesn't get boring no matter how many fights you are in. A downside to this combat is the presence of firearms. Guns are not introduced until about 30% through the campaign, and even once introduced you would be hard pressed to obtain one outside of a campaign mission. There is not traditional weapon select as there is in many open world games, instead you are able to carry one small firearm stored in your pocket, but that firearm does not persist between missions meaning that if you had a pistol in your pocket and then do a mission, likely that pistol will have despawned again once you re-enter the open world. The general lack of guns in Sleeping Dogs is not necessarily a bad thing however, because the guns you can use are in all honestly not always that fun. They do not really feel as satisfying as guns in, say, GTA do, particularly due to the lack of variation. While slow motion cover vaulting or quick disarms are fun, the gunplay itself is often quite lacklustre in my opinion, meaning don't come to Sleeping Dogs looking for a great shooter.

Perhaps my least favourite mechanic out of the whole game is it's driving. Cars in Sleeping Dogs handle terribly. Steering is not smooth, handbrakes are a joke, and the reversing camera is just plain bad. The redeeming feature of vehicles is the ability to jump from one to another. Despite how unrealistic doing this is, it is still satisfying to jump from one car to another in slow motion.


Overall, Sleeping Dogs is perhaps one of my favourite games of all time. It has an excellently told story taking place in a rich and atmospheric world with great visuals. The melee combat is deep and satisfying, even though guns and driving fall off a little, making Sleeping Dogs essentially a must for any fans of a good tale.",True
"This game is amazing. Steam's version of this game is horrible. 
Read through any of the negative reviews and you will seldomly see any complaints about the gameplay itself. Most people including me can't get the game to function! This game will teach you how to quick save every 10 seconds because it crashes so consistenatly it isn't a matter of if, but when. Or this game will force you to become an expert at installing mods. I was able to get the game to run without crashing, or infinite loading and it was wonderful. But steam saw i was having far too much fun with the game and decided that it'll crash and load infinitely even with the anti crash mods i downloaded. 
The game is amazing, One of my only 10/10 games i would recomend to anyone who loves RPG's. Buy it on a console, or another pc platform, you will be very happy you did.",False

"Rimworld is a steal at any price.
Every challenge is so engaging and compelling that hours fly by in a moment.
You constantly feel on the edge of collapse, and the verge of triumph.

Below is a story created from in-game events directed by the AI storytelling engine:
--------------------------
5504, 15th of Aprimay.
Rebar, first colonist of Bots, surveyed his handiwork.  8 finished bedrooms. 8 *personal* bedrooms.
Pure luxury.
It had been a long road since they crashed. Three hard winters and more, building this place up from the dirt.
But at last things were starting to really come together.

The next day the bugs came.

The insects tunneled up into the bedrooms.  Luckily everyone was out in the fields.
We gathered to plan.  ""Ok, we've heard about this. Fire works best, and we've got stone walled bedrooms with nice wooden floors and doors. This is as good as it's going to get.""
Rebar deconstructed a large section of his carefully laid wood floor in the hallway outside, as a fire break, then tossed a Molotov down to the nearest door.  The fire lit up like a champ and tore into the new rooms.  So much for luxury.

We hadn't heard about how the bugs could mine.

They busted through a wall and poured out in a flood toward a row of surprised faces.
The fighting was brief and bloody.

We prevailed somehow, but with at least half the colony downed.  That's when the steel vents caught fire.
The fire raged into the workshop, leaping impossibly from bench to bench, out of control. It swept through the base, claiming the lives of the downed colonists - except for one who we were just barely able to grab in time.
We set up a makeshift hospital and barracks in a separate greenhouse while everything else went to ashes.

The next morning we took stock:
Three colonists upright with cuts and burns.  One - the only one we could pull out of the fire - permanently bedridden with a shattered spine. It was Rebar.
We had no bedrooms.
No workshop.
No food.
No *tables*...
Just one sunlamp and some half grown crops.
That's when the raiders attacked.

We limped into the fields and took cover behind some sandbags.  Little good it did.  The raiders moved fast and shot faster.
We downed one... They killed two.  Our last man standing was clubbed down into the dirt, and taken prisoner.

The sounds of gunfire faded.
Inside the greenhouse, it was warm and quiet.
Rebar, last colonist of Bots, lay paralyzed on the dirt floor.  Wishing he could at least dig graves for his comrades.
Wishing there was even enough left to bury.",True
"Imagine, if you will, a giant dnd game but you play all of the protagonists. Lore intense, strategy, and turn based mechanics makes this game glorious to play. I've never played anything like it and believe me when I say I keep coming back for more. The worlds are detailed and it feels like there's always something to do. NPCs are interesting, even down to the smallest of rats to the largest of beasts. Being able to customize your characters though skills and attributions creates a unique approach to gameplay as each party member can play a key role in your quest of being Godwoken. Can't get past a certain battle? Adjust some skills and come up with a new plan to defeat your foes! Have someone dedicated to summoning while another snipes from afar. I never thought I'd love playing this so much and now I'm faced with having to pace myself. 

There's a lot I adore about this game but it's truly something to be experienced and not talked about. If you love tabletop rpg games, fantasy, strategy, lore, and fun characters, this game is for you.",True
"This game like all rouge like games has alot of replayability. Only problem is, without another 80 hours i can't see myself killing the final last boss of this game.  Though I know im not the only one who shares this sentiment.

Keep in mind its still a very fun game I would recommend buying it, and it tends to go on sale alot so when its cheap give it a try.",True
"5 years ago on a hot Tuesday afternoon in August. I came home from work sat down and started up a game called No Man's Sky. I had played for roughly 60 hours before putting it back on the virtual shelf. Back then the game was beautiful. It was a sight to behold; looking at other peoples screenshots of their brilliant worlds while posting your own. There was a sense of even if you are alone in the universe, you truly are not alone. 

As of today the game is no longer beautiful. The game has evolved to become truly breathtaking at moments. If you are on the fence. 

Jump!

You may regret it but YOLO.",True

"I was surprised at how good this game is not only at parsing insults for valid grammar, but also at scoring them on whether they make sense.  It is also surprising how outlandish some of the insults can be while also being something that someone might conceivably actually say... or write into a comedy script, which is close to the same thing.

And since funny reviews are a thing, most of the ones that look like looney non-sequiturs are probably straight out of somebody's match against the AI (...) AND are full of eels AND are not a part of Europe.

So if you don't mind blowing a buck fifty on about an hour's worth of silly jokes, this game might be right up your alley.",True
Only one word is needed...... Awesome.,True
dfgh,True
"So I bought this game a small time back, and I have been constantly coming back to it. It feels awesome to discover a new way to set up factories, develop new technologies, and most of all get some good ol' ""BOOM TIME"" with the natives. Factorio has a unique way of getting us to think of new ways to solve a huge variety of issues, from Alien landgrabs, logistic networking, pollution, and resource management. This is an awesome gem of a game to play whenever you like. This is a game that will keep you occupied and rewarded time and time again.

Thanks to the team for this one, I look forward to seeing where this goes!

P.S. I just LOVE the Men in Black reference in the first trailer!  Splat!",True

"Cannot and will not stop playing. Logged over 850 hours and still going strong. The game never had a lot going on for a while but with all the fine tweeking Bohemia have done and are still doing which in turn is allowing some really fantastic mods to either port over form Arma 2 or Ones that are completely new come onto the scene. With all the current DLC and the Marksman DLC on its way plus the winners of Make Arma Not War announced there has never been a better time to get on and get stuck in. Whether its life you're into, base building on Wasteland/Epoch or just blowing and shooting the hell out of stuff on King Of The Hill, If zombies is your thing try Breaking Point (These being the most popular) , If you cannot find something you like then you are doing it wrong. 

But i will not sugar coat it too much but it can be a steep learning curve for those new to the game and yes there are performance issues for some and it can be a challenge for some rigs but the game is still good at 30fps or dare i say it even 25(from personal experience). There are many forums with tips, tweeks and setups that can help you get the most from your Arma experience. It may take a little bit of time but it is worth it.",True

"This game is just really great. It's got this quality in which it is perceived as a relaxing time watching your little town develop whereas the truth is it can become a far more tense affair in which starvation, fires and freezing can be the cause of your towns demise. What's more is these can be triggered in the most unsuspecting ways be it simple or rapid expansion or even the addition of new buildings. Now you may be saying that sounds horrible but without these challenges what would be the point whereas the fun it would just be too easy otherwise and this way you get a true sense of achievement?

"I have seen many different games fail because of the same reason: Developers not listening to their player base and being high and mighty with ideas that they created in a vacuum and thinking they 'know better' than their community. This is exactly what happened with Dawn of War III, The Culling, and Friday the 13th to name a few. The developers of those games made unwarranted and unasked for changes to their game and then proceeded to bite the bullet andkeep those changes even after they had received negative feedback from their community. All of those games were completely dead within 3 months of making those changes and sticking through with them. Because DBD has a much larger player base than those games it is more likely the players will significantly drop over an extended period of time. But this game could easily lose half its player base within 1 year if they keep doing this to their community. The game is bugged and the animations did not even need changes in the first place. I played a match where the match just ended when one person used the key to open hatch. Just instantly match end even though only one person went through the hatch. I am leaving a negative review to stop the trend of these terrible patches, even though this patch is still somewhat bearable. But BHVR needs negative feedback otherwise in 2 more bad patches this game could easily die off and I am trying to prevent that.",False

"[h1]Overall:[/h1]
This is a wonderful game to get that nice hybrid of Jurassic Park with a Survival/Crafting game, looks amazing, and for the most part is FUN to play. (That's the point right?) I 100% recommend it to anyone that likes the Rust, 7 Days to Die, style survival games. And those Rimworld, Minecraft, Terrarria survival folks may very well enjoy it too if they can adapt to the FPS/TPS gameplay. 

[b]Note:[/b] I can't speak to the PvP aspect as I never did it, so keep that in mind when reading. This is from a PvE Group standpoint. 

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Plays well as a group of friends game. There is a lot to do so you never have someone who is just there. (well unless they choose to not help out that is) between Taming, Building, Scouting, and Resource gathering there is always work to be done. 
[*] TONS of critters to tame and use for all sorts of tasks. Personally, my favorite part of the game is going out and getting more Dinos and such. Advancing my own skills to get bigger, and more badass Dinos
[*] Most of the time the maps offer good challenge regardless of how much tech you've researched. 
[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list]
[*] There are some tasks that I do find almost require a dino to do well. However, considering their purpose in the game this is an understable point. It does however make the task that much more grueling when you don't happen to have one of the 2-3 dinos that are really good at the task. 
[*] The Scorched Earth map (at least last time I played it) is a little heavy handed with the environmental effects, especially since they didn't impact anyone other than players, this is completely up to personal taste though.
[*] You can't learn everything, (or at least you couldn't) which makes this game so much harder in single player where you're already prioritizing tech to get first, but now have to also determine which tech to just never have, because you don't have a tribemate to pick it up for you.

The convoys with special parts however were challenging to beat and quite fun to chase down. Base building is very useful but I couldn't understand what some parts are for. 
To new players I'd recommend trying to use storms to catch some parts because I avoided them until late game and found them to be quiet an enjoyable and especially rewarding challenge.

The reason this game is different from other survival games, is because its less about PvE and more about PvP. If you like the PvE aspect in survival games much more than the PvP aspect, then this game may not be for you. If you like talking to people, raiding their houses to benefit yourself, or are ok with them raiding you then you might enjoy this game. All in all, I think this game is fantastic, even though it's been in early access for 3 years, the devs still work on it. 10/10 would buy again",True
"Great game for having a laugh with friends ^^

You can play Board games, Card games, create your own stuff, anything really :)

"Rather than listing statistics or opinions, I think the best way to recommend Rainbow Six is to describe it in as much detail as possible. Whether this is a review in favor of or against R6 depends on whether the reader feels like the game interests them, and whether they have a suitable group to enjoy it with.
Unlike most shooter games, which emphasize moving quickly and scoring as many kills as possible, Rainbow Six: Siege features a unique form of gameplay. Rounds are played asymmetrically, with one team reinforcing and defending a building, and the other team breaching and attacking from the outside. Players choose from a cast of operators before each round, each assigned to either attack or defense and equipped with a unique gadget. As of writing this review, there are 29 operators on each side, for a total of 58. Attackers win by defusing one of the defenders' bombs, defenders win if time runs out or they disable the attackers' defuser, and either team can win by eliminating all five members of the other team.
Rainbow Six receives four major updates per year. These updates are referred to as ""seasons,"" and each one comes with at least one new operator, a map rework, various balancing tweaks, and a variety of new cosmetic items. Additionally, at least one event occurs during each season, offering a large batch of limited time cosmetics. Some cosmetic items, which in Year 4 and prior would have been added to the in game shop, are now released within the battle passes. Currently, battle passes release with the start of each new season, and offer two ""tracks;"" a free track that everyone progresses on automatically, and a premium track that must be purchased with R6 Credits, the games premium currency. The battle passes are still a relatively new addition to the game, and have been tweaked quite a bit since their introduction in late Year 4.
Rainbow Six is an extremely teamwork-centric game, and I would say the game is worth the money only if you have a group of friends to play it with. The game's steep learning curve, caused by its unique gameplay and amplified with the release of every new operator, makes Siege very unfriendly to players without friends to show them the ropes. The game's built-in ""newcomer"" mode is useless for genuine newcomers due to being filled with ""smurfs,"" experienced players who purchase alternate accounts to play against inexperienced players. That being said, if you do happen to have friends to play the game with, the learning curve can be accelerated quite a bit. Playing alone is referred to as ""solo-queue,"" and is an extremely difficult and tedious experience, especially in ranked, due to Siege's teamwork-focused gameplay and frequently unfriendly playerbase.
That's about all I can say about Rainbow at the moment. I can honestly say that I have gotten more than my money's worth of gameplay out of this title, but I can also honestly say that it is not for everyone. Hopefully this explanation was helpful in some way, to some prospective buyers out there.",True

"Its a really pretty and amazing exploration type of game. A few cons about this game so far though, that I would love to see get fixed. First, bugs and glitches in this game make some things impossible to do. When I try connecting things to power, it doesnt actually add power to the machine I try connecting it to. It seems like it picks and chooses when it wants to add power. I also find that you run out of oxygen and power way too quickly, and im not sure if thats the point or not. Lastly, the inventory menu is honestly terrible. It's a really good idea, but you have to be in the middle of nowhere, not near any walls just to be able to see whats inside. It also doesnt allow you to take something out and move it to a machine, because the inventory moves as you do. Dont get me wrong though, this game is really fun and would be better with friends. I just would buy it when there are lots of bug fixes, and maybe even more content to this game. It really is a beautiful looking game though.",True

"In a demanding and high expectation climate of gamers Miscreated stands out as game with several pros & cons, Which outweigh one another is entirely biased. You'll have people who find no reason but to remain in Day Z, H1Z1, Modded Fallout the list will really go on forever. 
So to keep this as convincing and straight forward lets just list out what this game has , doesnt ,but... Most likely will

Pros - 
1) It runs
I have a 1070 and I've had a 970 and I've had a 760, At all times in my pc gaming life I've been able to run this game on various settings always in 1080. Currently I can run the game above 60fps with my 1070+i5.

2) It runs on Cryengine. 
This only benefits why reason 1 is so spectacular, Cryengine will never not shine graphically in any generation of gaming.

3) Scavenging feels real
You don't just find a gun sitting next to a baby bottle in this game, or a pair of pink high tops next to an army jacket.
Using visual clues scavenging feels smart however, this isn't to say in more pvp areas of the map it will feel desperate and you may die starving or dehydrated with pursuers who also... You guessed it, want to blow your head off.

4) Vehicles
Almost all survival games have vehicles but, Miscreated takes it maybe a small step forward. While you wont be operating helicopters anytime soon between various bike types, cars, trucks, uhauls, buses there's quite a selection... Also if your feeling sea savvy...

5) Gunplay
While you may not see much of this unless you truly stack one server with everything you can find gunplay feels akin to Insurgency. Not the clunky prototype feel of a lesser survival games attempt at making guns feel real, but not spinning about counter strike style either.

6) Server Reliability
I've never been without a server that has excellent ping and a good amount of players. Servers allow 32 players which for the map size ( which is large ) feels reasonable. 
I've never experienced lag or been randomly dropped from a server unless it's due to my own internet.

7) Weather cycle
There's fucking tornadoes


8) Community.
 Miscreated not being a giant name like Day Z, h1z1, or Ark the player base has yet to become cancerous. Most encounters if dealt with right can actually become quite the experience and may even lend you a friend. Almost everyone wants to simply get by. It's rare even if someone wants to straight up kill you they wont play a bit with your head before popping it off

9) Town's and Cities
Orca Island truly does have a lot going right for the layout of their towns and cities , all feel real with buildings and small shops, local fire and police departments. From small town to the city of the north as players will refer before seeing how huge it is, Miscreated offers an immersive ""lets go shopping and not die"" experience on a small side note after a few hours you really understand the map and how to find what you need, using mountains to see distant cities 

9) Devs & Potential

To end my pros I'll praise the constant quality updates that add in real game content, this game has come a long way from where it started and I don't believe it's come close to peaking. I'll admit several things are still holding this game back when you focus on them so lets do that.

Cons

1) 'True Survival'
If you're looking for a game where the tempurate and weight of your clothing alone can wind up getting you killed this isn't going to please that hardcore part of you, PVE is extremely weak with little to nothing in the world actually posing a threat except maybe falling off a cliff you didn't (or?) see. Which leads me to my next issue

2) 'The Threat'
Zombies or mutants..lets just call them zombies are kinda laughable concept wise. The three variants either look like a redneck who transmuted into baraka (MK) an alien that got tired of living within Xcom and a giant tumor with endless HP
they spawn thin and if ever they do attack, don't waste time running just take a note from Signs or Indapendance Day and beat that baddy to death with the non breakable weapon of your choice be it a bat or your own fists.
speaking of fists not breaking

3) lack of character conditions
Between smiling bleeding and dead you will find no other suffering and don't expect those bottles of gin you find to have any affect on you neither

4) Base Building
This may be a player base issue more than anything else but don't expect to find any base that looks remotely plausible to being supported by gravity. Maybe you can craft an anti gravity orb in this game but I really doubt it...

5)Crafting 
Crafting is a definite miss with almost nothing to offer outside of ""well I guess I can make that"" 
There lies a few shining creations capable of being made but the majority falls next to pointless

"Brilliant game, and very underrated.

The problem is that most FF/RPG gamers are completionists, meaning they sit using Draw for 10 hours at the start of the game, or play cards for 20 hours, and get bored.

If you don't play it like that, and do a ""normal"" playthrough, it's pretty amazing.

Also, the card game and the GF system are both two of my favourite JRPG mechanics (and I've played a fair few).

The game before was relatively tolerable until the newest update came. They randomized spray patterns so much that it isn't even skillful anymore. If I could unplay my 800+ hours (over multiple accounts, refer to MR.SKELETAL in my friend's list) and unbuy all the skins and cases I hae ever purchased, I would. Until they fix every single little thing that they thought was too powerful and nerfed such as controlled spraying., I will not be playing this steaming pile of shit ever again. Good day to you sirs.",False

"For 5-10$ this game is fantastic. The combat system is great with a variety of infantry, calvary, and ranged units. There's a number of factions to choose from which provides good replayability. A solid playthrough is quite the committment so it's easy to sink hours into this game. City management is decent with factors including unrest, economy, and population. However, from cities are good while others are bad. There's no fixing certain cities and they're doomed to be financially awful so it can be frustrating. The diplomacy is the least exciting and extensive part of the game. The selling point of the game is absolutely the combat. Crush the rivaling factions alone with fun and intense battles. The diplomacy allows no true alliances and depending on what faction you play you can be surrounded by enemies and have to fight a steep uphill battle. All the factions are fun but some have a pretty solid advantage. The barbarian factions are more limited on technological buildings and  troops such as onagers, scorpions, and even stone walls. It's slightly made up for by the fact that the troops they do get can be outright more interesting. Like headhurlers who throw severed heads at enemies to lower moral or axe wielding berserkers who fight to the bitter end in a bloodthirsty rage. Once again you can see the emphasize on the combat. Despite the shortcomings in diplomacy the game is super fun and there's a large mod selection too. So go build your big badass army and conquer. Veni, Vedi, Veci motherfuckers.",True

So,pff what to say ... 

The game and idea of this kind a game is very good in my oppinion,BUT ....the gameplay must be much much better. I got glitched through wall,I walked on air, the helicopter part,the heli went through me and didnt kill me. The controls are also very anoying,happend several time that character goes fully nutz and goes back/jumps/ without me pressing controls to do so. Also killing zombie with axe sometimes takes like 20hits to kill it,and sometimes just goes for 1shoot.

The story itself is in some part good and in some part very bad .... I wont spoil for those who didnt played it but,at the end of game I was like .. really,that is best what you can do ?

The game is worth buying only when is on sale,buying it on full price is very bad idea and I DO NOT RECOMEND IT!

Controls are relatively tight because they are so simplistic: left and right arrows keys, plus ""Z"" to change gravity. Only issue I had with it is there is a slight drift once landing, and given how precise you have to be to get some of the achievements, this can be frustrating.

"This is a tough game to review. It's not perfect, it has some flaws. Even glaring flaws, like the poor translations which make some parts hard to understand.

Not to mention that the main way of learning the story is listening to your passengers, but that's made quite difficult because you have to take care of them and your train. So you miss out on a lot of backstory.

But it's also a fantastic looking game. I can honestly say that these are some of the best pixel graphics I've ever laid my eyes on. Better than some bigger budget games with more modern graphics. Plus for me I really enjoyed the gameplay. The running around and shooting just felt good to me. The world is interesting and I wanted more of it.

Once again, in the span of four (?) days, they (mainly Selphine and Rune though) get caught in a story rife of poverty, opression and betrayal

Liked the story very, very much
You get a nuclear explosion that manages to crash the game!
You get to see Rune and Selphine(?) being VERY awesome too!
There will also be just as much, if not more blood than the first chapter!
Early in the game, Rune will claim that she can catch bullets (20000 fps wow so op) and handle 10 grown men in a fight

"tl:dr dated graphics, good game, get it

I really, REALLY like this game. Even though it takes place in college, it really brings me back to when I was in high school since, lets be honest, this kind of shit happened all the time in high school, sans the time manipulation thing (GOD i wish i had that back then....)

The look of the game....this is square...and the way the game looks is somewhat old school. We all know what square is capable of making their games look amazing. And while the game still looks good, for this day and age, its a bit dated. Though I am half thinking this was done on purpose, since max, the main character, likes her retro stuff (i mean she uses an old school polorid ffs) they wanted to perhaps put that feel into the game itself? i dunno. 

Controls, pretty solid. moving is very fluid. If someone runs past you, they actually bump into you. The time manipulation seemed a SMIDGE clunky with some bits that just didnt work (Ie. i turned on a light, rewound time, the light was still on but i had the on option that i had to hit before i turned it off)

Price plan, they were VERY smart with how they did this. Buy part one, try it.  you like it? here is part 2-5 in a bundle. which i am about to buy right after i post this. 

I give this a 10/10 so far. lets see where the story goes.

Updated Review nearly 2(!!!) years later:

15/10 would feel again
I regret taking so long to get back to this game because my fucking GOD. This game. It pisses you off because you made a wrong choice, then you found it was a good choice, no wait it was a bad choice. It has so many twists and turns. yes its a choose your own adventure type game which has a primary narrative, but it does it so well you can't even really tell and think YOU are influencing the game so much that you even go back and try to make sure every conversation went right with people EVEN IF the game doesn't tell you its an important choice you've made.
This, my friends. Is one of the very few games that has ever brought me to tears.
My only advice to you if you do play it (which why SHOULDN'T you, the first ep 1 is FREE) is DO NOT REBOOT YOUR SAVE AND FIX THE CHOICES YOU THINK ARE MISTAKES. STICK WITH YOUR CHOICES

The voice acting was pretty decent, but the written dialogue felt somehow silly; was also disappointed that two clearly American voice actors were used for the English voice-overs (as opposed to, say, getting a couple of English-speaking Arabs with genuine accents). The graphics were equally decent, however they were greatly diminished by clumsy or outright 'ugly' animations. Gameplay was much of the same - decent, if not fun, exploration and platforming going on that is muddied by clumsy gunplay and just plain awful melee combat mechanics.

That being said, the story has some potential. I really appreciate some of the creative decisions made in this area, such as having the leading lady be the protagonist's sister as opposed to yet another obvious love interest playing the role of Damsel in Distress. I also enjoyed the Middle-Eastern setting, though felt like they could have tried to do more to make us care about our environment(s) - or, really, anything at all. Aside from a few brief text bits during load screens, you don't really get much in the way of lore or history regarding the places you visit and why.

All in all, I am looking forward to the second episode.",True
"9/10

Great game. For those who loved the original Commandos series, an excellent sequel with improved difficulty. Everything runs smooth, no compatibility issues (Win 8.1)

PROS:
- Great setting, atmosphere and variety in missions, from Normandy to Burma
- Graphics very good for the time, still holding on in my opinion
- Bonus missions motivate you to pass the level thoroughly, adding replay value

CONS:
- Would be great if there were more missions",True

"Buyer beware, this game has child nudity and torture in it ""just cuz.""  When you die, you're treated to ridiculously violent stills of a small girl often being molested by whatever killed her.  It's revolting, disgusting, and unnecessary.  The translation is laughable, the puzzles are odd and make very little sense, and the ""story"" feels like it was written by a traumatized 5 year old.  The game will not scare you, but it might make you laugh.  Again, this would be fine were it not for the child nudity in the game.

"If you have a nostalgia for Simtower or Yoot tower this game is for you! At full asking price with all DLC (which is optional of course, but my OCD prevents me from buying just a 'base' game) that's more debatable, some of you may still go for it. I got my copy on sale, primarily because I just have a nostalgia for this kind of game. I don't play it a whole bunch, but want to on occasion. 

Honestly my biggest con?

BACKGROUND MUSIC! There is only one song! It gets old very fast, specially considering it's in the main trailer showing off the game's updates etc and everything. It's an ok song and that's it.  BUT!!!! Nothing a little muting of the music in the menu and playing my own music can't fix, but still. Just be ready to most likely do the same yourself.

this game to me at the start is a masterpiece, it's beautifully made and created a realistic living word. 
i very quickly got into the story and couldn't stop playing, until i started the sidequests.. exploring...
Dying... to then find myself over 30-40mins back in time from my deathpoint. I didnt know i needed to ""Sleep"" or use a potion thing to save and even so once i did i kept forgetting, being killed by bandits.. after this happened a few times i slowly found myself getting extremely fustraited and annoyed. i felt that i was getting nowhere and so far i have given up completely. this game is totally worth buying but the save system hurts. alot. :(",True

"We all know that Team 17 makes the same game every single time.

But to be fair, Worms Armageddon was already as good as a game about WORMS waging in war could be.
This game is WA, but with more stuff, sure, it is simplistic, but its fun, if you cant chill with a game where a worm can throw a supermanish sheep that can fly around with a cape, I dont know what to say.

My only real complain is that the artstyle does get shittier every new iteration, again, Armageddon had it nailed already.

I do miss the original keyboard scheme, for someone who played Armageddon a lot during childhood, its hard to re learn... I keep trying to aim up and down with the arrows instead of W and S.

With that being said, this is the first time they actually made a worthy successor to Armageddon, maybe even surpassing it (I havent played enough to tell).

Bottom line, if you are new to the franchise, sure, get the newest... and if you are an Armageddon veteran and dont own it on steam, then get Armageddon first and then this amazing game.

Have I mentioned I like Armageddon?",True

"I have played this game since it first came to early acess. The game was absolutely fun. However, the minute they nerfed flyers speed, and added Tek, and did all these silly things it just went down hill. It legit can take days to breed dinos... DAYSSS.. and hours upon hours to tame one dino. Along side that if someone wants to be a jerk, they can come up and hit your tame once and ruin the taming effectiveness. So, those hours  you've spent sitting there protecting it, and making sure it doesn't wake up, or go hungry..  Those resources you've spent and time you've spent making the dino's kibble (also takes hours of work to make, and...it spoils)  are just lost really. The game is full of trolls and griefers anymore.

"I sincerely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys simulators or is looking for something relaxing.    As a fan of the Harvest Moon franchise, this game really hit a fix I was missing, but beyond that, it was a game that was also it's own thing.   Though the combat in this game could use some work, the sole fact that added it as well as many other things such as crafting, interesting tools, and all kinds of customization made this game unique from a market that while not flooded, is generally well covered.   The soundtrack is wonderfully blissful and incredibly well made, and the art style is fantastic and full of life with it's vibrant colors.   

Though incredibly simple, I lost hours on this game and the growth you are capable of acchieving in it.    It may be more of a binge game for me, as it is not something I decided to play all year, but it is something I do not regret losing days of my life on.",True
"So, my review might not be the most accurate, since I only have 4 hours on the game at time of writing this. But, so far, this game has been quite sub-par considering it is marketed as a [i]'house flipping'[/i] game.

I have not been allowed to [b]flip[/b] any houses yet.

From the name, I was thinking that maybe I'd get to play like a dinosaur or something and walk around as a T-Rex picking up and flipping houses. However, unfortunately I have not been allowed to thus far. I will persevere, maybe this game is a masterpiece such as [i]'Death Stranding'[/i], where you need to play for about fourty hours to get to the good part.

I will keep you all updated on progress, but, so far, no houses can be flipped :(


[b]EDIT 1:[/b]

Alright, so I have about 11 hours on the game now. I must say the gameplay that this game does offer is slowly beginning to grow on me. Yes, I would still love to run around as a dinosaur flipping houses. However, for the time being demolishing every wall in a house seems to suffice.

I still can't flip any houses, however, the gameplay is starting to improve...

"Hustle Cat is a somewhat short, but extremely enjoyable experience for otome players new and seasoned alike. Personally, this was my first otome game, and I was incredibly pleased with my playthrough, so much so that I will definately be going through and replaying some routes again (Landry is bae). The artwork is inviting, the music exceptional, and the writing exquisite! Each route opens up some more information on the facets of the characters surrounding you, and you come to care about each in their own right. My personal favorites were Landry and Mason. The ability to have a say in the player's characters visuals and pronouns was exciting! 
Grave's route was exceptionally well written, I must add.

Overall, I say give this game a buy rather than watch a playthrough. Kudos to the small team who made this adorable project available to us players. The only negitave is that sometimes it would crash, though only after autosaving so no progress was lost. Only happened at most 4 times throught my whole playthrough. Finally, I cant help but say that I think there are some  areas of the game that I've yet to get explanation for. If this changes I will update.

"Pros:
Good campaign story, voice acting, and cinematics. Side missions have (limited) strategic choice element as well to break up the mindless fighting. Combat effects have satisfying visuals and feeling of impact. The cover system is thematic and interesting (if not actually useful unless heavily built toward). Lots of equipment and skill customisation.

Cons:
Unimaginative, repetitive Dynasty Warriors-esq gameplay mechanics, but nowhere near as good. Seriously over-the-top 1 vs army slaughter whilst holding 1 button on a few very samey map layouts. In my opinion, the game would be enormously improved with greater focus on active investigation for clues, or incentive to covertly complete missions without having to reduce everything on the map to a fine paste because there is nothing else to do. Equipment level/rarity vs stat benefits could use a bit of streamlining.",True

"The warning provided by the Developer should REALLY be heeded. I'm not a DayZ fan, or veteran. I took a chance on this game because it seemed to have so many positive reviews. I understood that it was still in Alpha, but in all honesty, this game is almost unplayable at this point. Nothing is intuitive, and everything feels like it's more complex than it needs to be. Something as simple as grabbing an item on the ground involves pressing tab, to open a window, clicking on the item that you found, and dragging it into your inventory. Not hard, but why should it require all those steps? It doesn't make the game more realistic. I wouldn't have even thought to press tab if a friendly player hadn't told me. 

Movement is sluggish, with a noticeable delay when you move the mouse. Even with all my sensitivity settings on high, it still felt like my character was floating in molasses. What's worse is that melee combat is virtually ineffective. I lucked into finding a hammer, and there was a weak swinging animation that did nothing to the zombie chasing me. I couldn't tell if I was hitting him from point blank range. I wouldn't have even known I was taking damage if it weren't for a text warning saying that I was dripping blood. 

I can't be too harsh since the developers admit that this game is unfinished, but wow, they've got a LONG ways to go to make this thing better. It's extremely unfriendly towards new players, and the interface is downright awful.  My advice is to save your money for this holiday season, as there is no way they're going to be fixing all the problems with this game any time soon. This game has been in development for years, and if it's this broken now, I have a hard time believing it's going to be fixed in the near future.",False

"I loved this game! The cultural insights were really interesting and the concept was excellent. I also loved the art (I'm a sucker for pretty graphics).

The only downside was the number of controls - trying to contort my left hand to reach WASD, left shift, control and F was very difficult, and some of the actions have multiple keys (e.g. switching between Nuna and the fox can be done with Q, F and the right mouse, which causes chaos if one of these is accidentally clicked).",True

The game looks beautiful and plays great. During cutscenes lip syncing can go off and the servers tend to drop, which is a minor annoyance since there really is no good reason to have to be logged into EA servers. Although Nvidia Geforce experience tells me that I don't meet the minimum requirements to play the game (which by the way is a joke), Just Cause 3 plays great, even on this humble little laptop. There is a patch for the game, hopefully this fixed things for people who were having difficulty playing.",True

"Smash Up is a great game, but this program's interface is poorly thought out. Instead of making it an experience that makes game play easier, it's counter intuitive. For example, when you play the real game, you place a card on a base. In this game, you select the card, and then the base you want it to go to. Why not just drag it where you want to go, since this is intuitive for people familiar with the game?

Also, using a card's special ability is confusing. I still can't figure out how to use Tenacious Z. You SHOULD be able to just select it from the discard pile to play on a base, but there is simply no option.

In another instance, a bot's turn got hung up indefinitely until I exited the game and came back.

Fix this trash, or say bye-bye to your reputation as a software developer.",False
"Entertaining, as the number of hours I have put into it shows.
However a lot of its content is in DLC and it has many many MANY bugs.

If you are trying to stealth and kill someone near a wall, that person's body can fall through the wall and alert others on the other side.  Guards cannot see you if you are around 10m away from them and in direct line of sight but they can see a civilian lying prone on the other side of the level out of their line of sight.

Enter levels may contain passive enemies that never shoot at you.
If you've spent over 20 minutes doing stealth correctly, it may be ruined by just one person entering your game and intentionally ruining it for you, thereby making playing this game alone more rewarding than playing it with others unless you have friends who know what they are doing.

The game itself, whilst having its many flaws is entertaining.  Try it on a free weekend, or only get it when its on sale.
The developer's focus is not on fixing the bugs or improving the netcode (civilians and guards walking backwards) it is focused on making expensive dlc that normally means only a few weapons, or just 1 new level.
I really can't reccommend it now after knowing of many other better games with which to spend your money on, but at the same time I can't say to totally avoid it either.",False

"Fun game, but definitely not worth the price it's currently being sold for. The optimization is a mess and the gameplay is quite dull. The AI is even more of a mess. Civilians running around in circles, or running into walls, or constantly running in and out of the same building/house even though you're aiming at them with a gun. The controls aren't perfect as well, especially on keyboard. Lastly, the camera angle can be quite a pain but maybe that's just me. There were times where I figured I was running through a door but it ends up being the wall because the angle wasn't showing the full view. 

Anyways, there is a plus to the game and that is the mindless violence and action it contains. It lives up to it's description, and if you're in a bored, killing mood then this is the game for you. However, like I said earlier, the gameplay is quite dull. The destruction is nice however, blowing walls up, cars, doors, windows, it just works. There is some glitches with the gore and blood, but that's alright. I actually ended up refunding the game because I figured I'd get something that would consume my time more. I'm not hating on this game whatsoever, I think the devs did a good job on making a game like this. It really should be sold for $10, but again, this is just my opinion. 

I recommend it if you know what you're getting into, and if you wanna drop full price for it. The game hasn't been updated since October as you can see, and the optimization is bothersome. I ran it on an r9 290x and the game dropped to 30fps sometimes which was annoying but mostly was all over the place from 30-80fps. There is a bunch of useless graphic options enabled which I'm not a fan of and you can find a guide or do so on your own to turn off. 

In the end, I give this game a 3/5. I'd give it a 5/5 if the AI wasn't as bad as it is and also if optimization was A LOT better for this type of game.",True

"Bugs are nowhere near as prevalent as some are saying, but they are here and there. Furthermore, I for one have seen few games update and bugsquash this quickly. All the bugs I previously had problems with are gone.

The game is astoundingly well detailed, definately the single most beautiful RTS I have ever played in two decades of gaming. Seriously. Especially with more potent GPU's. 

Combat and base building it quite fine, if a little lacking in variation (more on that in a bit) though still enjoyable for the first twenty hours of gameplay. After that twenty hour mark however, I find myself a little bored with the lack of variation, since combat eventually boils down to ""Who has the biggest, nastiest doomstack"" which is the bane of more RTS' both fantasy and sci-fi than I can remember (e.g: Stellaris.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

However there are definately three big things I would like to see added to this game.

1: More/larger maps + map editor workshop.

Technically two but under the same category. I sorely wish to play larger games, especially with friends. At the moment maps are well detailed but both difficult to defend and rather small. I'm not asking for chokepoint maps, they can become dull as it boils down to who has the biggest mob pushing a lane, but then player led map design would give every kind of map a plenty.

2: More unit variation.

I can't help but feel as if unit variation in this game is sorely lacking. You start out able to train two basic units (one melee, one ranged) from your townhall, the same ones that can be trained from the barracks (at first.) When you get iron, you can train outright superior versions of these units, but can't upgrade the ones you already have.

This leaves you with a very linear progression of units that essentially boils down to having iron, or not. It's not a bad system per say, but increased variation (like having stealthy rogues that can ambush/lay traps, differing types of magic users that are a combination of ranged and melee like heroes, but nowhere near as powerful and without a skill tree. And maybe saboteurs that dress up as villagers unless they come into contact with a tower/military unit etc.) I would think could greatly improve combat. 

Combat itself feels very rock/paper/scissors at the moment, so I'm hoping for a little shaking it up. The 'special units' that require each factions unique resource are kinda cool, but simply just don't vary things enough, or quickly enough. 

3: Another playable faction, even if only in skirmish maps.

Lastly and least pressing I suppose. Dwarves I think would be a great fit, or a Necromancer/undead faction. Or both. Or more! At any rate, again, more variation would be great!

All in all it is definately an RTS I would reccomend. Just... wait for the next Steam sale. ;)",True

The graphics------ 10/10
Performance------- 10/10
     I have never seen such a well done PC port. There are many many options to set your graphics and performance to your viewing pleasure. As well as a benchmark to test the frame rate. Any negative reviews about performance are coming from a mongoloid who cannnot use an options menu.

Story------ 7/10
     The main story moves a little too quick for my comfort and does not have that same iluminati feel to it. I didnt learn as much as I wanted to about the ilumnati and the mystery surrounding Jensons DNA. Still though tons of e-mails and conversations too listen too. This game is packed with so much detail.

Detail----- 10/10
HOLY SHIT, so much real detail in the world. Posters,news channels, where objects are placed and check out all the apartments. You can learn so much from someone just by looking at thier room. 

GamePlay-----10/10

Dialouge/Dialouge choice--------6/10

ARCADE MODE!!!!-------10/10
There is a fucking arcade mode with it's own story FOR FREE!!!! It's so much fun and it brings a small multiplayer twist on Deus Ex.

Micro Transactions/ Video Game industry --------0/10

THIS IS NOT THE FAULT OF THE GAME NOR THE DEVELOPERS AND ANY PERSON WHO DID GIVE A NEGATIVE REVIEW BECAUSE SQUARE ENIX WANTS TO MAKE MONEY IS A IDIOT!!!!

"Quick Review Time!

Red Orchestra 2 together with Rising Storm are very fun and historical games, they capture the second war feeling and atmosphere in a realistic way. It's certainly one of my favorite shooter games. This game has decent graphics and a tactical gameplay focused on environmental awareness, getting on cover, hiding, crawling, crouching and sprinting at the right times if you want to stay alive and be effective. It is not a triple A shooter that you go running around crushing enemies with a machine gun. On this game you will likely have a trusty bolt-action rifle that has a slow rate of fire and is less effective the closer you are to danger. There are few portable machineguns per team compared to riflemen. 

You will learn to master your rifle, spotting enemies further away and changing your position to hide yourself. You will learn to use grenades to clear houses.You will learn to never charge unless there are distractions or smoke. (Unless of course your commander thinks it's a wise idea. cough...cough...Banzai!) 

Overall a classic. Fun game and most importantly several servers are active to this day so the multiplayer is alive and well. Buy it!",True
great game,True
"Got this, as well as L4D2, in a sale. Worth every penny!

Graphics are great, and even on my outdated pc, top graphics for the win! Perks of old games I suppose.

Really fun, several campaigns, room for modding, guns (no iron sights unfortunately), multiplayer (Co-Op & PVP) with pretty dead servers. If you haven't tried it, I'd definitely recommend it!
Quite horror film like, to be expected. Even gives you options in how much film grain you want.

Pros: 
- Multiple (short-ish) campaigns
- Easy multiplayer
- Varying difficulty
- Hordes & special zombies
- Intense survival aspects
- Pretty good (but repetitive) soundtrack
- Achievements
- A lot of freedom in campaigns, but punishment for spending time badly
- Good AI
- It gets easier/more difficult depending on your performance

Cons:
- Limited guns (not that you NEED more)
- Bad levelling (music) when there's a witch in the area
- Multiplayer seems to have decayed
- Lack of workshop (plenty of mods online, L4D2 has workshop available)
- Quite linear, but still flowing as individual campaigns
- No cards

If you haven't played this game, or you & some friends are looking for something new to play, then definitely check it out! I can see why this game became a leg-end.

Would recommend, quite a polished product!",True

"Skyrim VR does NOT properly support Roomscale!

Sheathe a weapon, equip a torch, and then walk across your playspace and turn around. Your sword will be floating in midair where your hitbox is stuck. There is no way to reset or 'recenter' your hitbox. Archer enemies will shoot at this hitbox regardless of where you are standing. Enemies will melee against this hitbox, regardless of where you are standing.

FOR CLARITY; YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THE STEPS ABOVE FOR THE BUG TO HAPPEN. THIS JUST LETS YOU SEE IT EASILY. 

TLDR; YOUR HITBOX DOES NOT MOVE WITH YOU WHEN YOU MOVE IRL.

If you go into the menu too many times and exit it too fast it will disappear and cant be fixed without a full restart of the game.

Native settings on 'high' preset (there is no ultra) are still BLURRY like looking through greasy goggles.

I'd also like to add that in-game (in VR) looks absolutely nothing like the screenshots or video even on high settings, by that i mean the textures shown in the promotional material do not even seem to exist in the game files, or you'd expect them to be evident on high settings - remember that 'high' is the top quality setting.

im going to push past two hours here so i wont be able to refund, and wont be refunding. roomscale not working does ruin immersssssssssion but i still want to play skyrim in vr and support the further development of vr titles. i do think that anyone who looks to buy the game at this point in time needs to be aware of this huge flaw and that attention and awareness has to be kept up to ensure that bethesda takes more action than a reddit post saying that ""the development team will look into it""",False

"Incredibly well designed and fun fun fun. So far I've only cleared the easiest setting, and there's still so much more to do. This is a game for people seeking a bullet hell challenge to go with their side scrolling and exploring. And there is a ton to explore and secrets everywhere.

I never ran into a point where I was so frustrated that I had to take a break, but some of the boss fights push you. I didn't run into many issues with the platforming and while the game 'punishes' you when you miss a jump, the level design is such that it doesn't delay you much. It's also an easy game to pick up and put down, as there are save points everywhere.

Finally, I have never played a 'Metroidvania' that allows you this much freedom. They give some loose objectives to move the story forward, but you are in full control of how the story plays out, and many of the achievements are tied to this experimentation, making this game near infinitely replayable if you want to try and get all of the 212 achievements (with the DLC). 

By the time I ""beat"" the game, I had only discovered 69% (nice) of the map and only 68% (almost nice) of items, so I'll be at this for awhile.

I'll finish by saying that while the artwork is certainly suggestive, I found letting my wife know that the game is actually well worth playing to get me past that hurdle (not that she honestly cares that much for my silly hobby). I don't tend to go for games with artwork this style, mostly because it's not what I look for.

"[h1]Remasters of legendary games often do not go over well,[/h1]
and the same could have been said for Bioshock Remastered when it was initially released. There were basically no changes over the original title besides an improvement to the textures, which left the remaster plagued by mouse-related issues, no FOV slider, and many, many crashes. As a result, many people were frustrated, realizing that overall, the original Bioshock was better than this remaster.

[h1]However,[/h1]
throughout the remaster's lifespan, 2K have released several updates, which added many of the features that were missing from the initial remastered version, including a FOV slider and different sound options (such as 7.1 surround). They also fixed many of the crashing issues and the mouse bugs that were present in the inital release.

"I really dig the game play here. It's apparent to me that a lot of thought was put into the platforming, teaching the player without tutorials, and building up my skills so that even as the game became more difficult, it never felt impossible.

The pixel art works well here, it helps keep thinks clean and easy to distinguish, definitely a good thing in this style of game. 

I didn't try to chase the strawberries or other collectible achievements, but I imagine you'd get a lot more than a 10-15 hours play time if you really tried to 100% this game. It's awesome they exist for the people who are into it, but man, I don't think i could dedicate myself to the task. 

I wasn't huge into the story or the disconnected art styles, but I've heard people praise it for the same reasons. No matter what though, they let you skip every cutscene. Very nice touch with that. At least they don't make you mash through text boxes if you aren't into it! 

All in all, if you're a fan of challenging platformers, this will scratch that itch. I loved the movement mechanics and the way they are introduced and combined throughout the game. Definitely a buy if you're a fan of the genre. The story in my opinion doesn't subtract, so for me it's neutral. And the art style i'm not huge into doesn't overlap with gameplay. (there's the cartoon style for cutscenes, and a pixel style for gameplay)

Basically, everything I'm not huge into, is skippable or optional, so kudos to the devs for catering the game to all kinds of players.

-Nonsensical story
-Unsatisfying (and arguably unfinished) ending

"Rust is a game that is in alpha development. Be sure to purchase it now in it's early release as it is just going to get more pricy as it updates. Rust is a survival game made by Facepunch Studios, the creators of Garry's Mod. It is a sandbox RPG. The game has inherited attributes to Day Z and Minecraft. You have to watch out for your hunger, how cold you are, the wildlife that can kill you and other players on the server which may raid you. You can also craft weapons from hatchets to all types of guns. Being in early development, the game is impressive. The graphics are of standard of an early release game, the features it has make the game interesting and fun to play and the gameplay itself is amazing. Also, if you are really perveted, you can type a certain command into the console to turn of the nudity censor so you will see males that are naked running around, unless they have put armour on. Being a game which you can do practically anything in, that is what makes it so fun to play and what makes you keep going back to play it again.

"My original review for this game was not recommended because I had a bad experience when I first bought it. After coming back to the game several months later with some friends I found that it's a lot of fun if you have people surviving with you and helping you build. My original review also emphasized how gloomy and dark this game is and how I didn't like that aspect. Sometimes the mood you're in determines whether you want to play/like the game. Some may not like this game because of the dark aspect and desaturated colors, and that's fine. I'd also like to add that this game is kinda scary at times. Everything in this game so far has been fun for me and my friends and it also provides a good challenge for us. It also allows us to be creative when finding the best way to defend our homes.

"Hitman Go was first released on mobile platforms. However, the game, on 23 February 2016, became available on Steam, PS4 and PS Vita under the name of Definitive Edition, bringing updated graphics, trading cards and achievements.

However, players should note that there are no new levels with Definitive Edition. It's basically a mobile game being integrated into PC with only upgraded graphics, so if you played the game on mobile already and are not interested in achievements or trading cards, there is absolutely nothing new for you that should warrant a purchase. 

Hitman Go uses turn based strategy in its puzzles. The players drag Agent 47 to a particular side to pass a turn during when the enemies also take their turn. Some guards are static while the others follow a path. You can't pass a turn by remaining in the same location which makes it a bit tricky at times to remain undetected. 

Hitman Go has 7 levels. 2 of them are inspired by Hitman Blood Money and Hitman Silent Assassin. Each of these 7 levels have their sublevels. A usual level has 14 sublevel while two that are inspired by previous Hitman games, have only 8 sublevels. 

Each level present their own challenges, new game mechanics, new types of enemies and side objectives. If you want to simply complete the campaign without any bonus objectives Hitman Go is a game that will be finished in roughly 4-5 hours. However if you decide to go for side objectives, which I strongly suggest that you do, its life span will be increased considerably.

There aren't a wide variety of side objectives though. Players are usually tasked with collecting a briefcase, not killing anyone, killing everyone, not killing dogs, performing a speed kill. And the most challenging of them all: X Turns or Fewer. Based on the level you are currently playing, you will even be required to finish it under 5 turns.

Hitman Go has such a simplistic design but it deceives the player into thinking that it is a simple game. It is actually very challenging and despite not allowing many different routes to take, it at least manages to keep things fresh by adding a wide range of guards that require different tactics to overcome and different game mechanics. In some levels you'll have to make use of secret passages to bypass guards, in some of the others you will have access to the most iconic Hitman weapon, Silverballers. Some levels have statues that can be used to either kill guards or block a guard's path. Some missions have sniper rifles available that will let you take down a target of your choosing without getting caught. Also let's not forget disguises! In short, there is a lot to utilise in order to successfully complete the mission.

Hitman Go artwork is amazing. I'm a big fan of its level design and graphics. The game gives me the feeling that I finally have the dollhouse I never had a chance to own during my childhood. I should note that some levels will include civilians that are there to add an extra detail to the level design. When I first came across one of them, I tried to stay away thinking I could fail if they saw me. But after experimenting with it I realised that really is not the case. In other words the characters that don't stand on lines will not pay any attention to you, so you are safe from them. 

So far I had nothing but positive things to say about Hitman Go. However, the game is not without its flaws and shortcomings.

One of the biggest flaw in Hitman Go is the camera angles. For a turn based puzzle game to not allow its players to freely change the camera view is something I can't wrap my head around. You can turn camera only to a certain degree but once you stop holding the left mouse button, the camera goes back to its original position. During levels when you need to assassinate a specific target, the camera zooms once you get close to your target disabling you from seeing the whole board. Some levels give you multiple targets so once you assassinate one you need to move to the next but you can't see the board so you don't know if you are actually safe to move.

Second minus for Hitman Go is the control scheme. It is understandable that the game has drag and drop controls on mobile platforms but unfortunately on PC, there is no other control options. You must drag and drop with your mouse which can be tricky as the same thing also needs to be done to change camera angle. I am not ashamed to admit that on numerous occasions I had to restart the level because I moved Agent 47 to a wrong location while I was trying to change the camera view. Additional control settings like keyboard or point and click would have had a warm welcome but presently these are not available.

Now comes my biggest complaint: There is not enough room for alternative ways to complete levels and most importantly it is impossible to finish the game with 0 kills (excluding assassination targets). Unfortunately some levels are impossible to complete without getting your hands bloody which is something unacceptable for a stealth purist like me! Previous Hitman games always provided the chance to finish the game by killing noone but your key targets. I know Hitman Go is not the same game as previous Hitman games; yet, I believe it could have easily added such mechanic to provide an alternative strategy to beat levels.

[b]TLDR version[/b] In summary, Hitman Go is a brilliant and challenging turn based puzzle game that sadly doesn't give a lot of room for players to get creative. Its flaws such as mandatory drag-drop controls and fixed camera angles are neither game breaking, nor should they stop you from enjoying the game.",True

"Legend of Mysteria is an interesting RPG Maker game, as there isn't all that much about that can be considered an RPG. After all, there is very little to do in this that you could consider an RPG: experience gain? Nope! Combat? Very little! Any reason to get into a fight ever? Absolutely not! 

Legend of Mysteria is less of an RPG, but more of a murder mystery/puzzler all rolled into one. There isn't too much to the story, but the gist of it is, a Demigod of one of the four magical elements is murdered, right before your character's very eyes. Shortly after his death, they catch the assassin responsible and he claims that the main character was the one who put him up to it, and thus you are framed for a murder you didn't commit. From there, you spend the rest of the game trying to clear your name.

As far as interest goes, the story is relatively interesting, but can get a little boring to follow at times, as it doesn't come across as one of the most memorable stories of all time - but it will definitely keep your interest if you decide to stick with it.

Gameplay is your typical RPG Maker affair, where you explore from the classic top-down formula that we've all come to know and love from the RPG Maker software. However, the main change this time around is the fact that turn-based combat isn't relied on in the slightest, unlike many others. Instead, the gameplay revolves around you exploring the gameworld, finding objects, talking to NPC's, and figuring out puzzles. As you go along, you will be introduced to a myriad of different puzzles that involve a lot of talking to NPC's, a lot of looking at different items, and a lot of interacting with objects throughout the world. It's effectively the RPG equivalent of a point-and-click adventure game, with some combat sprinkled in. 

The combat in this game is almost not worth explaining, as it is simply turn-based combat that has been done 1,000 times before in RPG Maker, where you choose your attack whenever it's your turn. Eventually, one side will win the battle and what do you get for your troubles? Absolutely nothing. Instead, the battles act more like an added extra to give the game its ""RPG"" status and to pad the game out somewhat more. Whenever you fight something, it just seems unnecessary, as it is so far and few between that it isn't even close to being the centre of attention.

Aesthetically, the game looks just like any other RPG Maker game on the market, but at times some of the maps are way too busy. What I mean by this is the fact that in a lot of rooms in the game, there are too many objects or the tilesets clash with one another, and it just comes across as hard to look at. There is one room in particular with 4 coloured spheres and around each segment of the room was a different type of element going off, and it was a complete mess to look at. Not a good look for the game in the slightest.

A small issue to be mentioned is that the game isn't exactly written in perfect English. At times, you are going to find a typo or misuse of a word, and it can make the whole sentence a little hard to read. While it isn't a big problem, a game that's based almost entirely on story and lore, you'd expect for the writing to be pitch-perfect throughout.

Overall, while I do believe Legend of Mysteria is an interesting concept and I commend the developer for trying something different with RPG Maker, it isn't quite enough to warrant a recommendation. A lot of the game just simply comes off as okay and while it does act as a prequel to the Labyronia series (from the same developer), but it just doesn't quite do enough to hold much interest. Unless you truly loved the Labyronia games and the lore behind them, I'd recommend swinging a miss on this game and trying something else.",False

"So first off.. i put about 20hours into the beta. Yeah the beta, before the game actually even released and now that its out i have about 30hours so far after a few days. So far thats about 1$/hour of skaven filth killing entertainment. the core mechanics are really fun, lots of different playstyles and classes that you can try out and get better at playing. 13 Maps are currently in the game and all of them are made really really well with pretty good variety. 

There is easily 80~ hours for a full playthrough of this game through all the classes and maps. but where this gem shines is through its Co-op gameplay tearing ass through skaven hoards and dismembering giant inbred ratmen is tons of fun when playing with friends even when you have to carry them through legend or even champion. 
The developers are excelent at listening to its playerbase and they dont block people off from one another if they dont have the DLC 's which is great and i applaud them for that.

Gameplay: 10/10
Co-op: 10/10
graphics: 8/10 - Great visual graphics but there is some missing textures and glitches here and there, doesnt detracts from overall enjoyment and gameplay though.

Mad Max makes good use of the Batman and Shadow of Mordor formula: huge map with a lot to explore, fluid combat, upgrades. It also adds a new system, cars! Driving is a bit clunky at first, especially because your car is terrible and you need to improve it. Max upgrades won't make it feel like a racing game, but it does enough of its job.

Not only that, the game is amazing presentation-wise. You have sounds matching stuff you hear in the movies, astounding graphics, good VA.

What could go wrong, you ask? Everything else. This game is boring, plain and simple. Couple that with a story that doesn't even try to make sense, and you have zero motivation to get to the end.

The idea is that the map is divided into areas, and each area has some stuff the enemy uses to show its power over that place (settlements, totems, minefields). Imagine that and multiply it by 15.
Exploration feels good for the first hours, but after some point, you will be fighting the same enemies at similar places over and over and over again.
It's worth mentioning that a lot of the hard-earned currency comes from liberating settlements, and the story also locks you until you lower the enemy presence in certain areas.

The game is worth a shot for a low price, but its lack of variety certainly damages what could be another amazing game from WB",False

"When you play a certain type of game a certain type of way long enough, you can’t just go back to the way it used to be easily. Case in point: the old Rise of the Triad and Blake Stone games. This was back when the name Apogee actually meant something.  I say it’s disappointing looking at myself because I’ve forgotten how to not WASD. See, back in the old days, you moved forward and backward and turned with the arrow keys, then had to hold down alt if you wanted to sidestep. It seems rather counter-intuitive if you’re used to the WASD system and it’s really hard to go back.

Worse still, the games don’t make it much easier because the key bindings are hard to manipulate and often don’t want to work with the mouse. That said, IF you can manage to retrain your hands, this is a great set of nostalgia that shouldn’t be passed up. Maybe I can get the joystick to cooperate…hmmmm.  As it stands, though, I can't recommend this one simply because of the control style.  If you're still used to the old control style, go nuts.",False

"First, let's just put this out there - when I look at all the DLC that I have not yet added to my library, it totals over $4,000 ... during the 2019 Steam Summer Sale. Normally, it's over $9,000. That's over $900 a year for a game that is a decade old at this point. And you will need at least a handful of DLC to really flesh out the content that is part of the base game. I would actually recommend getting the three Holiday themed DLC packs (one Halloween and two Christmas), you get the most bang for the buck with those, and don't even need the base game to play them. One plus is that I originally bought the 2017 version of the game with a sim bundle and was automatically upgraded to 2019 when that released on Steam, so if this continues, that's a plus.

That being said, right now, TS2019 is the premier Train Sim out there, along with TSW. You need to be very careful in your choice of which DLC to purchase. Each Engine pack usually comes with 3-4 scenarios to play, but at $20 a pop, that is still pretty expensive for a bare minimum amount of content. The scenario packs generally have a handful of routes to drive, but the problem comes when you need a specific route DLC AND a specific Engine DLC (or two) in order to have access to every route that is included. So a $10 scenario pack can wind up costing you $40 or more in order to play everything included in the pack. Another issue is that almost none of the routes/scenarios in any of the DLC are drivable in all four of the game modes.

There are four games modes that you can drive in:
Quick Drive - you can pick a route and an Engine and just go from point A to point B anywhere on the route.
Career - A points based version of routes where you are scored on your ability to follow the rules of the rails and complete assigned tasks.
Standard - A non-points based version of Career mode.
Free Roam - Just like it says. Pick a route and just drive the train without having to worry about the rules or the need to complete any tasks.

That offers a lot of possibilities, but as mentioned, almost none of the scenarios and routes are available in all four modes. So if you have a favorite route you like driving, you may only be able to drive it in Career mode or Quick mode. Or a route may only be available in Standard mode. For the cost of the DLC, there should be no reason not to have each and every route available to drive in each mode to its fullest extent.

In the end, I would recommend this game. It is fun to experience the ability to command a variety of engines, and learn the differences between driving a classic steam engine and a modern electric engine. However, you will need DLC to really get more than a paltry base amount of content, and you really need to be picky about what content you want to add to the game. If there are routes and engines near your real life area you want to drive, just stick with that at first and add on later. I would definitely recommend waiting until the stuff you want goes on sale - it does so often enough throughout the year to make waiting until then the smart thing to do.",True

"A horrible piece of crap that's not even worth five bucks, it's a badly ported console game. The input controls are glitchy in general, it barely supports the steam controller, the menus are completely unfit for computer use. Apparently this is still a game from the 1950s when mice still had to be invented. Additionally, it's nearly impossible to play with the average controller because of the way the control mechanics work, since you pretty much have a 2° error margin on the joysticks. And with keyboard it's also just horrible. I hope this piece of crap game catches fire and burns down capcom with it.",False
"Awesome game!
Definitely worth buying, this is one of the best games in its genre.
It´s not only good-looking, but also has everything I could wish to setup in a game like this.
It doesn´t matter if I want a more challenging gameplay opportunity, or just delving into a most peaceful ""city"" growning and developing, the game´s got it all.

Easy to learn by yourself, with many efficient icons, tips and tutorials. Lots of different buildings and, definitely!, several fun characters!

I´m having a lot of fun both playing the campaing and the Free Play, and I´m pretty sure the game is going to be even better as new updates come out.

"This game is one of the best i've played ever. thankfully I had not seen the trailer in about a year so completely forgot about things that turned me on to the game int he first place, and ended up surprising me during the run. if you don't know what's coming, it's epic. And it just continues to surprise after that.

The dialog and humor work very well. I actually wanted to know where the crazy story was going next. And it's very self-aware. This kind of humor is tricky to pull of and this is borderline perfect.

It feels very very easy at first. however the challenge scales nicely, if you take on the challenge rooms for seals, and gets very challenging once you hit the DLC. But it's never punishing, always fair, and you will get better as you keep playing and learning. Kinda like old school games but better.

The seals are worth collecting for the satisfaction of completing the challenge rooms and unlike what another review said, I believe the reward is worth it. At first I wasn't so sure, but then I played the DLC and realized its value.

I added onto this review after playing the DLC. My opinion of this game was already high but that took it to another level. I can't wait to play whatever comes next.",True

Outside of an armada of pay-to-access content, and some b.s. cosmetic crap, this game really doesn't have much more than it was released with.

It's crazy to see that this hand-full-of-ass hasn't flopped yet, but it's only real competition WAS Friday the 13th right? I haven't heard anything about that since it's launch either.",False

"I played Dishonored, so there is quite a bit of nostalgia, but even so I have to say the game is great. the story is great, it plays a lot like the former dishonored game. that said i have experienced a few things tied to optimization that need fixing before I'd call the experience great.

my rig is:
Windows 10
GTX 970
I7 6700
game is on HDD 7200
16 GB DDR4

I play it on 4K, so some things have been set down from ultra to high, the ones I found I could live with, and it's still a beautiful game running 40 fps, but the things that need help are the mouse (it has a lot of settings like smoothing, but even still, it's not that good), the blocking and the powers/gadgets menu. I haven't experienced any dips in framerate, but I do have a good setup, so I don't think my experience will count for that many. keep your video drivers updated, it's crucial, and too many people forget it.

I will recommend the game, in the current state it is in, but I will remind you that I am very fond of the franchise already. when they fully optimize it, which I am sure they will, it will definitely be worth 60 euros, but untill then, if you're new to the franchise, you should get the first game and play that, 'cause it's great, and then jump into this one.
hope this helps some people :)",True

"Initially, I had a very negative review of the game.  I came in wanting to love it, but playing it is way less fun than watching the gameplay in the trailer a couple times.  There is a frustrating initial 'what the heck do I do?' learning curve for surviving the first 10 seconds, and after that there isn't much to the game.  It's very pretty, but none of the game mechanics are fun, they're just something awful to do while you experience more prettiness.  All that is still true.

However, I was hugely mistaken about this game!  It would appear that when the game is on sale, as it is currently, the cards can be idled for more than the game costs...which gives it something anyway--right?  10/10 would idle again.

Is there anything good about this game ?. Yes its a MX vs ATV game. It hase some tracks from Reflex and from Alive.
If you start the game for the first time be warned about the bad bikes. Once you actualy upgrade yure bike they will be better.

But srrsly am i the only one who have the feeling that u either ride the 250 what feels like riding on Blank ice and you dont have any Controll mid air. Or the 450 what feels like an actual Rock but a feather in mid air.

Speaking of with the Physics and the Driver Reflex there just both bad in this game cant deny that. Mx vs ATV Reflex where they first introduced that Reflex system its amazing it just feels right but here its just awfull.

And why they decided to make this game instead of Reflex 2 what i am sure more MX vs ATV fans would love to see why arent they making one ? Idk m8 ask Jesus.

"--- UPDATE ---

As of now (10/09/2017), there's a bug where you get stuck in a loading screen forever when you go for a 1v1.

--- UPDATE ---

As of now (03/09/2017), playing on-line is near unplayable sometimes due to the amount of people on-line and the latency issues; the servers just can't handle it, and it shows far too much now. This is funny and sad because it used to be playable. It is because of this that I can no longer recommend this game even for those who love upfront PvP because it lags too much to be taken seriously. I will say that - even if you are interested - just wait for the updates to roll in first; otherwise, your first experience is going to be as sour as bad milk.

--------------------

Let's be clear here: 
I Love This Beautiful Game, and my hours played on Steam don't reflect how much I have actually played because I own a copy of Absolvers on GoG.com as well.

But I can't recommend it to the general public because, being honest...
1. The UI is 101 terrible; it's annoying to navigate through it on the first time through, and one of my friend vomited while making his combat deck because the white colours were nauseating.
2. For a single player experience, Absolver is pretty bad; I only took almost 4 hours to finish the main story (and I was fooling around for most of the time), and I still don't know what the heck the story is about despite reading every NPC text and exploring everywhere (i.e. do not expect Dark Soul-esque lore). This is important for those not playing Absolver for PvP but - instead - for a brawler or an artsy game.
3. The map is very vague and you will most likely get lost on your first time getting around, a lot, unless you have a friend to guide you through.
4. The learning curve varies from player to player, but it's pretty steep. The tutorial does not explain all the mechanics; in fact, some of the mechanics can only be learnt via talking with the NPCs. Some combat deck combinations will be clunky and your first will most likely be pretty clunky unless you 'know' these kinds of games. As you can tell, if you're not the experimentative type, you're going to hate this.
5. The music is... What music? My music kept stopping by itself while I was playing despite having the volume at full. Whenever there was music, the music is forgettable.
6. There are moments where you have to grind, especially to unlock certain moves or to get clothing/fashion drops, and - while the grind takes reasonable time - it's mind numbing if you proactively do it. 
7. The lock-on system does not work properly with more than one target; in fact, your character may even hit the closest target most of the time and not your locked-on target. At times where you're fighting 3 or more NPCs, the lock-on system can be downright broken and can even mess up your camera.
8. The camera is sometimes frustrating; it loves rubbing itself on the floor or walls and, because of that, you can't see sometimes.
9. The sound effects are unimpressive, except for when you hit hard - which then it's pretty satisfying.
10. Despite having good connection, myself and a lot of other people are having inconsistent connection issues - ranging from 'smooth' to 'broken'. As you can tell, this is very frustrating for a fighting game.
11. The game's main seller is PvP; if you don't like PvP... Well... Absolver is not for you. Period.
12. Even with the PvP, there's not much content in this game; even now, some players and a few Twitch streamers have already quitted the game because they're done. I don't know how they maxed out their level so fast though; I'm only level 46 as of typing this review.
13. There's always friendly fire for both the NPCs and for you and your friends. This can lead to some hilarious results, but I can see this being annoying. Also, I know a few of the player base who proactively kill/hunt newbies so... I'm not really sure what to say about this?
14. I got hit by a save corrupting glitch during launch. The developers said that they will fix this soon though.
15. You can't skip cutscenes nor dialogue.
16. I have gotten stuck on a loading screen at least 4 times throughout my experience playing. I had to Alt Tab and turn off the game and then turn it on again to continue playing. I have crashed once, and I do still experience glitches. Hopefully, these will be fixed via patch because - otherwise - the game is running at 60 frames VSync for me.
17. You can't manually save; the game auto-saves but doesn't even explain how or when so you have to guess when the auto-save happens.
18. There is region lock despite having limited servers so... Hahahahaha...\
19. ... And there's still more but I'm tired of listing new stuff because I want to go back in and fight.

--- VERDICT OF RECOMMENDATION CHANGED DUE TO CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES ---

With all this aside,
If you're here for the PvP, combat and multiplayer, and if you don't mind the learning curve while having a good internet connection, I would definitely recommend this game; otherwise, no because it feels unfinished and - sometimes - plays like it too.",False

"Now this is a game for two types of people, those who like horror and those who like surreal games. I'm more of the surreal side although I do love a wonderfully crafted horror game, not the type that every person on Earth has seen someone else play. This game has wonderfully crafted levels and an amazing soundtrack to fit. The story is not explained until the end of the game which adds to the playthrough by making you ask questions to yourself. The levels are very strange and leave themselves up to interpretation. I was wary at first in fear of it being a walking simulator but quickly found out that it keeps you on your toes with amazing level placement. For example, one level will be exploring and the other a puzzle, or perhaps a creepy chase. 

Overall I would say that this is one of the best surreal games I've played if not the best. If you're a fan of games like this you should definately pay the small asking price.",True

If any of you guys liked resogun i believe you will enjoy this its kinda like resogun on steriods, With gorgeous 4k visuals complemented with housemarques trademark particle effects it really is a spectacle, and with a £14.99 price tag it seems like a no brainer.",True

"When I first heard about this game I wasn't too sure about it considering I've played alot of survival games that didn't really do it for me. But considering that I've always had a thing for dinos, and prehistoric creatures in general, along with scifi, this was a perfect fit for me. I started on the Xbox version, but I moved to pc, and the pc one is soooooo much better, At least in my opinion.",True
I dislike this game.,True
"I've bought this game on 40% discount, so around $6 or so. Here are my 5 cents:

This game was the first game I played with a ""Narrator Twist"", which seems akin to the one on ""The Stanley Parable"" (also on steam). That is, you have a narrator telling you what to do, but when you disobey him, funny things happen. This review is about playing on Hard mode, which quite honestly I felt it was more around ""Medium"" for a player used to these action games. 

Pros:

- The secrets of the game vary from too obvious (the narrator insistence on you following the arrow make it obvious all the time there must be something around), to medium: Sometimes, you must learn of a certain way of interacting with the scene in one portion of the map, in order to observe how to interact elsewhere. Others, really require a inquisitive mind. I think the devs did a good job here. I bet there is still a hard tier level for a few things. Lastly, the devs also tried to be counter-intuitive on things that in other games you would expect to have a negative consequence. I personally appreciated this piece. 

- The combos are great and feels great. There is enough flow on the game that makes you entertained in smashing your joystick buttons. There is a sufficient amount of variety in the attacks as well that allows for enough play styles. Yes, there is the usual X->X->X->X or X->X->X->Y but you can also unlock other buttons of your joystick to do other things. Some of those other things are timed based, or more specifically ""the moment an enemy is exposed"". There are also finishing moves and counter-attack moves that takes advantage of that, air combos, ground combos and ""imortal combos"" at the stake of something (won't spoil all the fun, right?). Personally, I didn't find the combo list that extensive, and it is unclear what and when will unlock others (who knows, maybe I will find another one). 

- Lore: The game actually does have a lore that is only told as you explore around. I loved the poetic style of the lore, and the .dot hack take the game embeds everything. There is room for jokes, for serious content and more. It is short, indeed, but if you take the time to appreciate the parts you will see several elements that can make a game a fun experience in a breadth way. 

Cons:
------

- While I had my share of fun on just the tone of the narrator, I couldn't understand a single word. This often forced me to keep ""dashing up"" so I could take a break of the fight and follow up the lore. I saw they are working on english voicing recently, but for now this is still a cons. 

- As others pointed out, when re-playing the stages to ""branch out"" on other parts, you can't cut the narrator short. Instead, you must listen all the same babling again. For the most part, I sat working on my other computer while the narrator kept babling. Perhaps, considering the devs intended to make an annoying narrator, this is part of the twist. But sometimes I felt rather than annoying, it went brainwashing. 

- Because the game allows you to return to some maps, everything resets. This include the ""cash treasure chests"" you find around. If you really want, you can keep restarting the map over and over to farm gold and lvl up all your skills. Since this is an offline game, and you're really taking the challenging aspect or fun of it, I would consider someone exploiting this throwing their money away, but hey, it is not everyday I see you being able to do these around in a game! 

-----

Final Remarks: I would recommend playing this game casually, or you would run the risk of ending too soon. Think of the game as your small universe to come back from time to time and experiment praticing playing through different combo styles when fighting bosses, and you will likely finding it more rewarding for your money investment, rather than rush to beat all ends.",True

"This is a game for the glutton, the hardy fool stepping deeper downward into madness and the macabre. 

Do you enjoy pressure?

Because this game hefts the burden of adventure squarely on your back and doesn't think twice about applying further weight. It is about risking the lesser evil lash against your favorite sword-at-arms that just might save the entire party, or forcing the heavy hand of loss---the gear acquired, the coin spent, the time given and heroics witnessed---against the whole. This is a game about choices, the worst of choices, and their dark punitive glee. If you look to negative reviews complaining about difficulty, this fact will be confirmed. 

Make no mistake; this game is excellent and does precisely what it intends to do, from the artwork to the slow, bone grinding of the mechanics. Only ask if this game is for you.

"Who shouldn't buy this game. If you are expecting this game to be more like the other AC games where the game wants you to stay hidden. Then don't buy it if that is a make or break. The fact is, there is no hidden blade, there is no throwing knifes, and things like taking out people around the corner isn't possible (or it's really hard to get it to work or it's messed up). 

NOTE you can hide at times, and what not. But I've had problems where the NPC seen me through boxes and what not.

Now who should buy this, anyone who wants to experience a good story, anyone who didn't really hide to start with in the AC games, and those who loved the movie 300. 
As far as the 300 thing, note how the movie had the people doing odd things that looked cool but wouldn't really work in RL. A lot of those things are in this game. Even the kick is in this game.


IMO this game should've been some non AC game. The game has a good story IMO, but it feels like someone had an idea for some game and some head told them to make it within an AC game to increase sales. The game is good without the AC name, but with it I kinda felt messed over.

Also, IMO the leveling is a bit too slow, and the wep tend to be pretty bad. Part of the reason why I think this game is another game wrap with AC is how many of the wep at the same level of the person you're taking out won't kill them. But it will take a good 98% of their health away. This means you must fight the NPC when you should've just been able to take them out. Like in pretty much all the other AC games jumping off a roof to take out someone tends to do just that. In this it might not. (Some might say, well just put your game on easy mode. I did and it still pulled this.)
Like in prior games I could take out someone 10 points higher if I stay hidden and played the part. In this you simply can't do it unless if you have the right skills or wep. And even then it is a hit or miss.",False

"In the last few years the knights templar for gamers became synonymous with the Illuminati with their representation in the Assassins creed universe.....already going off track here. When I first saw the screenshots for the game back in 2011 like many i thought it is an AC rip-off or ""the poor mans AC"" as i heard some say and did not even bother much until last year when i got it during summer sales.

The first templar takes place after the 3rd Crusade(1189–1192), its a 3rd person action-adventure game and features co-op.You can play as 3 main characters which are interchangeable.The game begins with Celian d'Arestide(the main character) and Roland de Saint-Omer starting their quest for the (you won't believe it) THE HOLY GRAIL !!!11 , cheesy as it sounds the story is actually very complex and has nice twists towards the end and you meet more characters during your journey .

Now lets talk about the first thing you experience, the graphics, while the game is not a triple A it still looks good with beautiful colors and textures, and while the character models look ok, there is no motion capture and it feels sometimes stiff.The soundtrack is nothing special, but the voice acting is quite good.

The gameplay is where the game shines, the game has an excellent combat mechanic,as you level up you can learn new moves or improvements of already learned moves , each character has its own unique style Celian - Sword and Shield, Roland TwoHander and the 3rd main character Marie d'Ibelin has a rogue style gameplay with her weapons being daggers, although it seems like an rpg feature its not, there are no skill trees and in the end you can have all skills and upgrades.You can upgrade your equipment, but this is also simplified, you can use an armor or an weapon set only when you have the full set, you find pieces of these sets hidden in the levels also they aren't many and give some stat improvements but they cannot be combined.Also besides combat  you have puzzles which add some flavour to the game and in some levels you can use cannons which also adds to the game.

In the end although the game is simpler than other AAA games , its good story and decent combat will keep you interested as you find out the secret of the holy grail and who is the first templar :)

I still suck at Blitzball, at least that has never changed.

"I just bought game on my steam, after playing it on a friends steam for some time..

I read the mostly negative comments(13 at the time)and is stunned how most of these 13 people can judge it to be ""booring"" and ""not much to do"" after only 15min playing it.. 

We defently need a 2hour game limit on give tumb down or up review atleast.. !

I like this game, it is a good game... 

All i ask Devs is they add adjustable GUI for us with 4k screen :) even the fonts is readable more then other similar games with no gui adjustment, it had still been nice to see the text littlebit easier :)

"God, this game looked so good, and maybe it can be fixed, but some of the issues I'm having are systemic rather than bugs or tuning. I'm requesting a refund and am only 1.5 hours in, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.

Combat:
So the combat is pretty standard souls-like: dodge rolling, stamina management, parrying, etc. Other reviewers have mentioned that the controls are strange, like a dedicated ""hold on to ladder"" button, and that the dodge roll consumes too much stamina. You can get used to the controls or rebind many of them, and I can see the numbers being tweaked on stamina comsumption. My issue is that bosses and enemies don't seem tuned to the fact that you can't spam rolls. Some of that can be smoothed out by learning what you can avoid without dodge rolling,  but some enemies can chain attacks together seemingly endlessly. Black Knights in Dark Souls are far more fair than the Golden Knights in this game. Black Knights have rest period between their extremely hard hitting attacks, Golden Knights do not. I will grant you that this may be a learn to play issue on my part, but right now I feel these enemies, as well as a few bosses, feel like they have a serious telegraphing problem and don't mesh well with the extreme amount of stamina drain from dodge rolling. 

The second issue I have with the combat is quite a bit more subjective: the sounds of player and enemy attacks aren't crunchy enough. I feel the impact when I hit an enemy in Hollow Knight or Salt and Sanctuary. The enemy flinches, flashes white or spills some blood, and there's a satisfying metal thwang. This is particularly egregious when it comes to enemies hitting the player, which I don't feel give enough visual and auditory feedback. Attacks on the player feel like scratches, when they're taking off massive chunks of the player's health bar. Many enemies would hit me and end up standing next to me, still doing their combo, rather than knocking me back. It feels wrong, is the best way I can say it. The enemies don't get stuck in the player's hitbox, but it almost feels like they do. 

Atmosphere:
Level design is alright. I felt pretty lost and that's what I come to metroidvanias for. Areas feel visually distinct, which makes them easy enough to remember, especially when you're re-traversing them due to copious deaths. That said, I hate the atmosphere in this game. It's all over the place. Characters are talking about war and death, yet the world feels colorful. Vibrant. Alive. Part of this is due to the color palette. It's colored like The Banner Saga but it talks like it's Darkest Dungeon. 

Another inconsistency is the soundtrack. Other reviewers have praised it as beautiful, and it is, but it doesn't fit the tone. Again, you're a corpse re-animated by Death himself to do his bidding, and it sounds like Danny Elfman is hiding in the bushes. The music is symphonic and bright. It's like a Disney movie. Hollow Knight got away with that kind of soundtrack because the darkness of it's setting was slowly revealed to the player. This game opens with your protagonist about to be thrown on a pyre of corpses. It can't get away with this bright soundtrack.

Finally, there's character design. Every character is an overdesigned edgelord. Some of them, like Death, look awesome. Other characters, particularly a female knight you meet at the beginning weilding a halberd (I tried to look up her name and couldn't find it) less so. It feels like Lords of the Fallen in here. Armor has so many individual pieces and ripples it's ridiculous. 

Now, the soundtrack, character designs, and color pallette would be absolutely fine, but not together, and not with this game's story. Imagine Spawn hanging out in Fez with the soundtrack to Edward Scizzorhands and the story of Painkiller. All of these things individually are fine but together they're a mess.

Story:
Finally we come to story, which I admittedly experienced very little of. I can only comment on it's beginning, which I feel is a trainwreck of confusing nonsense and misplaced flashbacks. The player begins talking to a lizard man straight out of The Elder Scrolls, who remarks that you're alive and should be grateful. That's cool. What happened before this moment? No clue. I walk a few feet and Death arrives to tell me about a contract we agreed to. I don't remember this contract but, and this is crucial, my character does. He doesn't have amnesia, he isn't sleep deprived or drunk. He knows exactly what happened to him before I took control, but I'm totally in the dark. 

So I have a contract. I move right and gradually learn that a war happened. Presumably two nations are attacking each other and a great many people would rather I fuck off, but Death has other plans for me. What those plans are, I have no clue. After a few deaths something very cool happens. My character, in their death throes before I respawn, reminisces about his life before he was a soldier, and was just a kid on a farm. The scene is very cool and surreal, with Death pontificating on the nature of himself. This happens a few more times. I die, I have a sort of ""cutscene"" that fills in my backstory, and I come back. 

Again, my character doesn't have amnesia. These cutscenes are purely for my benefit. That's cool. I want to know more about my character, but they're completely misplaced. I still have no clue what Death wants me to do or why I was even here in the first place. I'm actually paranoid that a cutscene was supposed to happen when I booted up the game the first time that somehow didn't trigger, or I accidentally skipped it. I have no idea. Still, this is horrible. 

At the beginning of Dark Souls I know I have to escape the asylum, and later I learn I have to ring two bells to figure out what my purpose is. At the beginning of Salt and Sanctuary I know I was on a ship with a princess, and now I'm stuck on an island searching for her. At the beginning of Furi I know I have to escape the prison. I don't care about my character right now at the beginning of the game. What I care about is what my goal is and why I'm in the position I'm in. I should ideally know that information within the first hour, if not the first 5 minutes, but I don't. 

Things the game does well:
I like the death system. Every time you die you lose a health item. This is like losing an estus flask charge if you're familiar with Dark Souls. You can recover this charge by either returning to your point of death and grabbing it, or by sacrificing some exp to get it back. 

I like the horse. Fast travel is best when it's not a generic warp from point A to point B like most games do it. I like it to be contextualized, and ideally that fast travel would happen in real time. I don't know if this continues into the rest of the game, but based on my limited experience it seemed like traveling long narrow passageways with the horse that you gradually opened up was how it was going to go about things. Even if it doesn't do this, I still like the horse.

Special abilities. The controls are weird, requiring you to hold down a button while pressing another, but they're interesting. It's like swap-out-able spells for melee characters. 

I also like that a ranged weapon is given to you as standard. The game can theoretically build challenge and puzzles based on knowing you have this with you at all times, which I like. Arrows are also refreshed at checkpoints and upon death, rather than purchased. Very good.

Petty gripes:
This is just personal preference, but I really dislike RPGs that require you to play a set character with a set appearance. This is especially annoying since the dude has no voice actor, unlike most of the other NPCs. I don't find his design or personality all that special to warrant him being static. The Last of Us doesn't work with a player designed protagonist. Neither does Tomb Raider. This game? I don't understand why it doesn't have a character creator, but lets you choose a class.",False

The animations (raptors) are laughable, but the solid gameplay, large variety of weapons, the different playstyles of the classes, map and mode variety, and the occasional hilarious bug (i.e. a Rex that flies threw the air upon death) make this game an incredible experience that I keep coming back to.

"Starbound is amazing and even with my 166.8 hours on this game already i feel like there is still so much i can do! this review might not completely accurate (because Frackin' Universe is just too dang good) I still believe that no matter what you can get so much out of this game. Wanna be a farmer? You can do that! Wanna be a outlaw? You can do that! Wanna be a landlord? You. Can. Do. That. I feel like there is so much in the game that i don't want to stop, and any time i play i find myself nonstop playing until I realize how late it is. I can go on and on about the amount of voicelines there are, how many times this game made me laugh through descriptions alone, or the fact that you can force gnomes to work for no wages in factories because WHY NOT, but if i did this review would take too long so ill end on this.

The demo happens to be the most enjoyable part of this game. if you plan on buying this game its most likley because you want more mapps or the campain mode. the campain mode is littearly the quick game mode just with turned down intenesty, it makes the game soo unbarebley diifcult and enraging because the whole enemy team is attacking you from all sides and only the smallest part of your team is attacking, and if you manage to grind your way to the enemy base, all of asudden you find your self 5 objectives back. it is the most iritating game i have ever and i maen ever played. however if you love ridickloulsy difficult games this is the one for you.",False

Its a nice and calm game you can play when you come back home from a stressful workday. There is so much to customize, your house, your farm, your machines. I played this game for over a year now and then and didnt unlock all content ( There is also always new content !)

The enemies are too cute to be feared !

I needed some time to figure out the slime science part, but thats because I'm a total slowpoke.

Sometimes i wish there could be an multiplayer option but its not like extremly needed and the game is still developing (in a very good way). So you never know!

"El Tratado de Versalles fue el más importante de los tratados de paz que pusieron fin a la Primera Guerra Mundial. El Tratado puso fin al estado de guerra entre Alemania y las potencias aliadas. Fue firmado el 28 de junio de 1919 en el Palacio de Versalles, exactamente cinco años después del asesinato del archiduque Franz Ferdinand, que había conducido directamente a la guerra. Las otras potencias centrales del lado alemán firmaron tratados separados. [I] Aunque el armisticio, firmado el 11 de noviembre de 1918, puso fin a los combates reales, se necesitaron seis meses de negociaciones aliadas en la Conferencia de Paz de París para concluir el tratado de paz. El tratado fue registrado por la Secretaría de la Sociedad de Naciones el 21 de octubre de 1919.

"Seriously disappointed. I waited three years and paid £40 for what feels like an £8 early access game.

If I had never played other spacey classics like Mass Effect, Eve, Elite, even Spore then I may have actually thought this game was OK. However as it stands, it just seems like a poor mash-up of features from other games, none of which seem to work very well. Where I was looking for something original, what I actually got was Frankenstein’s Monster.

One things that has really bugged me so far is the level of detail, of which there is none. Walking up to a big rock and taking a close look reminds me of the mountains in Oblivion (which is now 10 years old), not to mention the game’s “physics”. Almost immediately after starting the game, I walk over a small hill and found a floating cactus-looking thing. On a number of planets, there also seem to be floating rocks – I’m not sure if they are going for an Avatar Hallelujah Mountains sort of thing, or if this is just another issue. Also, the general sluggish feel of the movement really makes the game feel too slow. I am running this on a great PC, but it performs pretty poorly. 

Despite all this, I will carry on playing the game. Although I really do hope that the game is developed further with future updates.

4/10 – would rather trade Spice with non-procedurally generated Spore aliens.

"Short and quick review:
- Fun to play in co-op
- Difficulties seem nice. Pretty easy compared to others so it's good for FPS beginners
- Horror is also nice for beginners (those that're not used with horror) but some parts are just awkward lol
- Road to ending was abrupt. It's like they skipped so much and just showed things through cinematics
- Gameplay was also nice for beginners
- Game-time is totally not worth its normal price (very short compared to others in this price range)
- Not worth to replay imo
- A bit buggy. My data got magically corrupted lol
- Multiplayer game is dead if you don't have any friends to play it with

Overall, got a mixed impression but the short game-time made me feel like I've been ripped off lmao. Although I did buy it in its normal price so it's best to wait for a sale if you ever plan to get this game.",True

"As someone who only started playing Fighting Games in 2018 with the release of Dragon Ball FighterZ, I would still consider myself fairly new to the genre - but it's been some of the most fun I've had playing video games in a long time. While I'm not great at them by any means, I absolutely love the competitive nature that fighting games bring, as I also like going deep into learning the systems and workings of each game I pick up. In these 2 years, I've also played Skullgirls, MK11, SFV, Smash Ultimate, MvC 2 and 3, and now TFH. 

And I can say without any doubts that this game is certainly my favorite.

The art and animations alone are more than worth the extremely low cost of this game - and that's simply the foundation of this amazing fighter. Every character is extremely smooth to play, each with a distinct, unique playstyle that differs from the others. Never do I feel like my inputs don't go through or are misread as different moves, it's always what I want to do, I will do. Hits carry weight and are extremely satisfying to pull off, giving you an amazing sense of gratification when you see your enemy either go flying back or get slammed into the ground. And while yes, a roster of only 6 may seem small by today's standards, these characters are by no means shallow - just trying to learn even 1 character means you will have to dedicate some time if you want to get good with them. 

This doesn't even include how amazing the online play or story mode is. The former, I will say is hands down one of the best on the market right now. A netcode that genuinely works without double digit frame input lags is insanely refreshing in today's world. And the story mode - just play it. While there's only 4 chapters right now that can be completed in around 4 hours, it is hands down the best story mode for any fighting game, period. It doesn't just sit you through 5 minutes of cutscenes and then put you into a fight, and then show you ANOTHER 5 minutes of cutscenes - no, it actually allows you, the player, to fully explore and interact with the world around you, filled with plenty of fun secrets to unlock customizable items for your online character. And it isn't even just fighting enemies either - there's also platforming sections, and a combination of the two for a mix of platform fighting. 

I'm just simply astounded at how a game this amazing is so under the radar. This game is truly what the industry standard for fighting games SHOULD be. And those who turn away from it because of it's artstyle are truly doing themselves a disservice. Judging this book by it's cover doesn't even give you a taste at how fantastic a game TFH is.",True

"House of the Dying Sun is an intense and very fun space shooter. What makes the game unique is the nature of the missions you have to complete in order to progress. They are basically hit and run missions, where you have to assassinate an enemy lord or complete a specific task and escape, before enemy reinforcements arrive. This feature is what makes this title so much fun to play. As you complete more missions you can unlock modules, weapons and more ships to join you in your campaign.
By equipping different modules and weapons you can customize your ships and make them suitable for a certain role, like bombing capital ships or going after enemy fighters. Different loadouts change the way you play and how you can approach your targets.
Changing to the tactical map gives you the option to take a better look of the battlefield and guide your wingmen more efficiently. Overall House of the Dying Sun is very good game, with intense combat, perfect for fans of the genre but also newcomers.",True

"Biased review ahead.

I've been playing Kupo's games for years, since the very first Epic Battle Fantasy game. I've completed every single one - and most, more than once.

With all that said, allow me to attempt to explain why this game is good:
-Elemental attacks\resists system is very intuitive. Very much an old-school JRPG system.
-Multiple difficulty levels, with the easiest one being 50% enemy stats and various attacks weakened to allow the weakest players a chance to progress anyway. Meanwhile, the most difficult setting gives enemies 200% stats and allows them to use their nastiest attacks, making for a real challenge.
-Can be played for free on Kongregate for a try, if you're uncertain. The paid version not only supports the author but also includes a miniboss and boss marathon, as well as some new bosses to challenge players.
-Everything in this game is beautifully drawn and totally adorable in every way; from the legless cats to the slimes to the shrubs and even the characters.
-Jokes are well spaced out, and the game doesn't break the fourth wall too often to devalue it.
-Multiple skills and abilities allow for varied strategies.
-Good clock-time, with new game plus and new game plus plus to extend it even further for those hungry for more.

Now, the cons - for almost every game has some. They are nit-picks, though:
-The game has permanent stat boosting items, and while you have four characters only three are active at a time. This means that the most effective strategy is to dump all the stat boosts on three characters and leave the fourth as backup permanently.
-Eventually your strategy will devolve into buffing your party, debuffing the enemy party and using one big all-target skill or spell for an attempted instant kill. You will be using different skills for different elemental types, though.
-The higher difficulties don't offer increased experience\item\skill point rewards, despite taking at least four times as long (enemies have 200% health on hardest, to the 50% on easiest). This means most players will usually fight trash mobs on easiest and only fight the bosses on the hardest. Even that, only once, for the achievements.
-The game has some of the ""but I might need it later"" with one of it's consumables (chilli bottle, which refills the limit break bar of a character).
-The huge variety in gear does lend to some very slight inventory management, mostly just before bosses.

I absolutely love this game. 9/10.

"I can see how this was an early hit for VR. It's very polished, has more of a narrative than most of the other wave shooters at the time, and stands head and shoulders above a lot of other games. But ultimately it's a wave shooters with a little bit of exploration to break things up. You will stand more or less in one place while numerous zombies shamble towards you and you usually have to kill them all before you can move on. 

They move slow, as proper zombies should, but they frequently can be tough to take down either because some of them are wearing helmets and other armor or because some are just tough SOBs. Most of the big setpieces are like the events in the Left 4 Dead games where you do something loud like set off an alarm and have to survive the horde that it draws in. I found it kind of tedious by the second time and just wanted it to be over by the 4th.

My favorite aspect of the game was undoubtedly the exploration. Walking down a highway clogged with abandoned cars, opening doors and trunks to scrounge for supplies while keeping an eye on the nearby shamblers was very immersive. It was just the big setpieces that I found boring.

And sadly, like most VR games, Arizona Sunshine is terribly short. I beat it in a single afternoon after about 4 hours. I would say that the game is worth it if you can nab it for less than $15 but not at full price.",False

"Easily one of the most engaging and gripping games I've played in recent years. Probably ever. The characters are fun to watch, if not a bit depressing at ""certain"" stages of the game. The humor is genuinely funny and witty, and the way the game implements you, the player, as an actual character is a wholly unique mechanic I've yet to see replicated in any other game. And this is without mentioning the wide range of emotions the game makes you feel. I'm only able to recall two occasions on which a video game has made me cry. Both of them were on Console.

OneShot is the only PC game to ever make me tear up. The endings are just that powerful, especially a very special one. And the main character is likeable, cute, and makes you genuinely care for them and what happens to them.

The Story and World are exceptional. It is masterwork, especially in the case of the story. It tells you just the right amount of things while not giving too much away, letting you just have a few hints of what might be really going on. The world, and by extension, the art in general is gorgeous. The characters pop right out from the background, which is amazingly well crafted and colored as well.

And the soundtrack... My god, the soundtrack... I can't even describe this part of the review other than this. The soundtrack, for the type of game this is... It's unrivaled in my own opinion. Being at the absolute top right next to the likes of Undertale and Mother 3.

All of this melds together into an amazingly crafted game. Not just a game, a work of art. Something you will remember for a long time after finishing... The characters, the areas, the soundtrack.. It all blends together into this amazing, albeit short, experience of a game.

[spoiler] Which makes the final choice that much more difficult. Choosing between the needs of the many you've only seen a few of, and the needs of one who you've grown to care and love... I will admit, I made the selfish decision. [/spoiler]

Bottom line - This game is 100% worth your money. And I would jump at the chance to experience it blind all over again.

...But remember.. You only have One Shot.

[spoiler] It's only been a few hours as of writing this, but I miss you already Niko. Hope you're doing good back home, hope you enjoy the pancakes. [/spoiler]",True

Link to the trailer on Youtube.
It's as amazing as the trailer makes it seem.
The Abyss Watchers are amazing!

Things Dark Souls 3 did good: 
1. Bossfights
          All of the bosses are incredibly fun to fight. (Except Deacons of the Deep.) They are all quite challenging. (Except Deacons of the Deep and High Lord Wolnir.) All of the bosses look really cool. (Except for Deacons of the Deep and the Curse-Rotted Greatwood.) They are all fair. (Including Deacons of the Deep.) Some bosses have one or two attacks that are aren't fair, but they don't do those attacks very often in my experience.

2. The World
          Lothric and the areas around it are fun to explore and challenging. (I'm Lvl 94 and I'm still finding new things.) Irithyll of the Boreal Valley is beautiful.

3. The Combat
          Fighting enemies, NPCs, and bosses is really fun. With most enemies, if you get cocky, it doesn't matter how good you are; you gon git messed up. Combat is fluid and tense. After I beat Pontiff Sulyvahn for the first time I had to sit down for a while because my heart was beating so fast.

4. Lore
          The Lore is incredibly interesting. If you want to learn about it and are too lazy to piece it together yourself (like me), then check out this channel.

"Global Offensive did something very unexpected when I first launched it.
It actually managed to blow me away for atleast a little bit.

I pre-purchased this in the 11th hour, after changing my mind whether I wanted to give it a try or not. I had to go through a series of problems with my anti-virus software to finally get it working.
Now, what blew me away was as the menu opens, looking reminiscent of those of the previous games, but with a really nice polished look to it. The game fired up theme music. Counter-Strike suddenly had a voice!
On top of that it's even really good and memorable. After some time bumping into it again it actually gave me shivers.
It hurt my nostalgia muscle to see tagging is removed and you don't choose skins anymore. But it made up for it with more smooth gameplay and better hit-box.
Official inclusion of the gun game mode was a smart move, and they've improved the way you set up games. The few new weapons there are fall into a good spot, and they feel welcome.
I think it delivers nicely on the nostalgic feel, while giving a modern vibe with professional execution.",True
"If Telltale's Game of Thrones had been more like this I might have played it to the end. The confrontation mechanics add a welcome sense of real stakes, and make sure that paying attention and gathering information are rewarded in the gameplay itself. The rpg elements have many small rewards and choices making you feel like your decisions already have some effects in the first episode. Taking the time to scavenger-hunt for manuscript pages and amber will pay dividends later on.
It may be mostly social interactions with hardly any puzzles, but the game is compelling and hard to put down and actually rewards making an effort in a way that too many pure-narrative games do not these days.",True

"Fantastic experience of dungeon crawling with the tension of permanent consequences. I'm still early on in my exploration but I see myself applying myself to this to get to the bitter, rewarding, end.
I picked it up to give me some creative inspiration for running the pen&paper RPG Torchbearer, as DD has been noted as evoking the same feeling of tension the TB is aiming for. I found the stress both fun and inspiring; your enjoyment will depend on whether you want to feel the icy creep of despair along with your fun game-playing escapism.

"If you like the ""runner"" genre you'll love this one.

You're basically running through an endless tubular map and you jump to either side or straight up and you can jump higher by holding the button/direction pressed. You cannot move more than 1 tile to the sideways without landing first though.

The goal is to get as much energy as possible by running on the blue tiles while avoiding any collisions or bottomless pits. Once you reach 100% of energy you're free to collide against something or fall to end a stage, otherwise you can keep going and try to reach a higher score.

* Simple graphics, which means it can run on any toaster and wont bother you while going at full speed.

* Good soundtrack! It's kinda electronic-something, I don't know, it sounds good enough in game and it changes dynamically (The more upbeat version plays when you reach over 100% of energy).

* Controls are quite comfortable. You can just plug in your Xbox 360 controller and be ready to play. You can move with the triggers, the shoulder buttons, the directional pad and the analog, they're all supported at the same time.

* Excellent port of what I suppose is an iOS game. No flaws in framerate nor stuttering or anything.

* Achievements aren't something so special here, they're all about you beating a stage. Latter stages are quite hard though! Still, it would've been cool to have some weird achievements or even some score attack ones to push you to try harder.

* Good replayability if you care about score attack and leaderboards.

I'm sure the graphics are WAY too simple for a lot of people but the game is just 3 dollars full price. I don't really mind that. I had lots of fun so far and I expect to 100% the game in a few days.",True

"What drew me initially to this game was the fact that it is indeed an offical part of the ""Spec Ops"" series (As in ""Spec Ops: Rangers Lead The Way"" and ""Spec Ops: Ranger Elite"", two of my favorite old school tactical third person shooters). I did some research, and the buzz/hype around the story for this game caught me off guard, as the older titles were not particularly known for their storylines, but instead for their difficult and tactical gameplay. I gave in, and decided to buy it, and was most certainly NOT dissapointed. The story was absolutely incredible, and definitely deserved every bit of praise it's been given. For me personally, it was pretty mind blowing. The gameplay however, did not quite match up. The tactical shooter gameplay was almost non-existant, and was traded in for a more bog standard Gears-like style of cover based third person shooting. I do admit the combat was punchy, and satisfying, but definitely nothing too note worthy. It's also a very good looking game, with the destroyed city of Dubai still managing to be stunning, even in sand dune filled ruins. Definitely recommended!",True

"While Mars: War Logs is not a AAA game I still enjoyed it a lot.  Enough so to go back and replay it to see the other ending.  Almost all aspects of the game scream indie meaning things like Voice acting, character animations, character customization/skills, etc., are done failry well, but not quite as polished and deep as you see in other major titles like Mass Effect  In one respect, you could almost consider it a rudimentary version of Mass Effect.  Playing through the game you'll notice these shortcomings or lack of depth in each aspect of the game, but if you can look past theses definitely enjoy the game.
To be honost I am a bit of a snob and won't touch games unless they're of AAA caliber.  Mainly because I don't have a lot of time to play games so I want to spend what time I have on worth while games.  By chance I decided to give this game a try and the first couple hours of gameplay were enough to pull me in.  The environment and setting of the game look absolutely amazing.  The devs did a great job of creating a dystopian city on mars.  I found the story quite interesting and kept me intrigued throughout most of the game.  There are some pacing issues towards the middle, but if you stick to the main quest line, you can power through through these slow points fairly quickly.  
The other thing this game did well was the combat system.  I thought it was done quite well feeling very smooth and polished.  It never felt awkward or clumsy where my character was slow or didnt attack when I wanted him to.  The one thing I found to be a bit irritating was its very easy to be swarmed by a group of enemies and die.  But to be honest this serves to make it more challenging.

All in all regardless of the shortcoming I still very much enjoyed this game.  A solid 7/10

TL;DR
Great story and combat system but lacks depth in all other aspects of the game.  They are still done well so if you can look past this shortcoming you'll definitely enjoy this game

I still regularly play this game and encounter newer people all the time in expert. If L4D3 ever releases, it will be a day one purchase for me, just as the first and second game.

The gameplay is very easy and provides an extremely simple array of choices, but manages to be extremely enjoyable. Hacking and slashing skeletons, spiders, and demons and collecting their loot has never been more streamlined, and the very high production value makes it feel satisfying. Don't expect anything challenging (and don't expect a deckbuilding experience) and you'll be very charmed by this richly detailed tribute game.",True

I've played over 500 hours though the Appstore before realizing it was on steam, and it is my favorite Civ game and one of my favorite games of all time to this day. There is still a huge imbalance between the different affinities (why go for anything but Harmony lol) but diplomacy got a massive overhaul and many of the weird bugs and crashes got fixed, not to mention the fact you can put cities on water now.

"Another game I really wanted to like, but just didn't do it. Seems to be a growing problem on Steam - mediocre games that are almost good or not quite finished. Anyway... it is overall an ok 4x game. I like the combat idea and the story line/background is compelling. But game playing is boring and very trial by error.

1: Tool tips, manual or something. There are many different things in this game which are simply not explained anywhere except on various game forums or Wiki's. And probably many more functions I have no clue about becuase I want to lucky enough to find the right chat room room or dedicated enough to hunt the right forum post. And all the expansions make this into an even bigger issue. I did not buy the game to spend hours researching how to play it - I bought it to have fun.

2: Random it is not. Try it - play a battle. Wait for a rare big damage score - then drop out and load the Save game, Start the same battle again - you will get the exact same results, including the rare big damage, in the exact same order each time. Now, I have not scientifically proven this but have tested it and well... 

3: Difficulty Settings do not increase AI quality - just makes battle uneven. Yawn...

4: Crashes - but mitigated by the excellent Auto Save feature.

5: Strange behaviors... selected AI game with me and 7 other factions. All set to ""Random"" - game choose the same two factions for all 7 options. Then sat for all 450+ doing nothing. I saw this type of dumb AI several times until just got sick enough that I go back to flying Kerbals.

There are more - both good things and bad. But there is nothing here to get excited about. And that is the problem really. What it does is OK - but a lot of other games in the genre do it OK or even better. It does nothing GREAT or new or if it does, there is no way for you to find out about it. So yeah... meh.

"4 hours in, and it's already annoying:

 - I can either pause the game or change my graphic settings, but cannot do any configuration change and expect the game to keep paused.
 - Characters and conversations feel plain and boring. Not much role-playing to do yet.
 - Can't steal (not a problem in itself, but for an RPG as open as this is supposed to be, it feels anti-climatic).
 - Unable to climb a staircase.
 - Ok, so... you can't jump. Again, it's not a problem in itself, I don't mind having reduced mobility if the story is engaging or the combat system fun... but I find neither of those things here u.u

"It’s quite difficult to review Syberia, because there is a lot of light and shadow. I really liked this game a lot and can hardly wait to start with the second game, only taking time off to go to work and write this review :)

The story of this game is brilliant. The female protagonist’s character development is really plausible. Through adventure she develops from a docile and a bit haughty lawyer to an emancipated adventuress. The brilliant part is that I believed this development. The story is set in a mix of modern day with alternative reality. So there are cell phones and steampunk elements. I won’t elaborate on the plot itself as that might spoil your fun. The story comes to conclusion in this part with a wide open door to a sequel.

This is a really old game published in 2002 and you can see that. 3D rendering and models look much better nowadays, but this never bugged me as the design of the locations you travel looks simply great. The story takes the protagonist to 4 different places each with a distinctly different design. From Gaudi inspired Valadilene to the aptly named Barockstadt to an industrial complex and a rundown Russian spa. All of this locations look rather gritty as this places have seen better times in previous decades.
Syberia has a lot of cutscenes which have movie quality (not the graphics, but camera style) and a fitting soundtrack. The soundtrack varies in quality. Sometimes the cheap synthesiser sound spoils the good composition. Voice-acting on the other hand is constantly on a high level.

As you’d expect from a game that is 25 years old gameplay is a bit outdated. Magnifying glasses and arrows show you where to go and where there is something to do so most of the point and click action is very obvious.
There are actions that feel quite illogical. The protagonist will not pick up a dirty oar or put even her pinky toe in the water to get that oar. No, she has to look for help. To advance the story you have to listen to a lot of dialogue from side characters and read many pages of diaries. I didn’t mind this as I also like to read books, but beware if you are looking for a fast paced game. Syberia asks you to take your time.
Potentially there can be a lot of travelling back and forth if you are unsure what to do next. As most of the steps I had to take to advance in the game felt logical to me this happened only two or three times for me. There is no map for fast ravel so you actually might have to click your way from one end of the village to the next. Double-clicking at least lets the protagonist jog through the scene instead of walking which might explain her well-trained body :)
You cannot save manually and the auto-save function only activates when you enter another scene. 

So despite Syberia’s limitations due to its old age I recommend this game to everyone who likes a good story and doesn’t mind to take his/her time to play.",True

"i recommend for the developers but the community is really toxic, i didn't enjoy playing this game and deleted it quickly",True
I loved this game.  It brings me back to a time when a good game was about a compelling story and characters that you care about and get attached to.  The story was very enjoyable and reminiscent of a choose your own adventure book.  Sure you’re going from point a to point b but how you get there and the decisions along the way can be unique.  Combat was fun and in certain places very challenging.  It feels kind of like chess which is easy to learn but difficult to master.  The score was moving and the artwork breath taking.  Part one of a planned trilogy you’ll have to wait to resolve the story which ends on a bit of a cliffhanger.,True

"just bought the game yesterday and my opinion its great,
the first hour was a pain in understanding the gameplay, just trial and error.
bet once you get it its really fun to play!

i would like to bring in that you use at least the first 30 minutes in setting the graphics perfect for your card.
took me a while but hea its running great. notice that it is an early acces and it is still in development.

its an MMO where you need to think ahead, as the title said, survival. yeah thats true. you need to monitor everything.
food, water, building a place to sleep. hunt some dinosaurs for meat and make a fire to cook and so on.

it isn't the traditional gameplay, just about tactics, surviving, learn items which you can craft, finding the materials, build a hut, weapons etc.

doubts? just try it, dont like it well just ask our money back in time and no harm will be done!

I was skeptical about this game initially, but it actually was quite entertaining.

"[b]Short version:[/b] If you like the management aspect of Prison architect and similar games this one is clearly for you. Just less dead people and a bit more depth on the management part. 

[b]Long version:[/b]  

Pro:
- There is always something to improve / optimize / expand in your airport. Even after 60 hours I don’t even feel close to a perfect and smoothly running airport -> very long-time motivating, resulting in high value for your monies 
- If you like micro-management you will love this one. As an example: Every single trash can needs to be strategically placed.
- I’ve reported a bug in the forums, got an insta-response from a dev. And with a bit of delay the bug was fixed. :)

Contra (most of these can be considered normal for an EA title):

- Right now it’s imo too easy to swim in money, which can be nice if you just want to relax
- The graphic is a bit inconsistent and currently some animations / sprites look a bit off. But imo these kind of games are not about fancy graphics anyway
- A few minor bugs / AI issues that you probably won’t even notice

My personal wishlist, just because I can 😃 :

-	Ground personnel, including drivers for the vehicles pretty please!
-	More underground options (tunnels for vehicles would be great)
-	Please increase the range of PA speakers, and add a high-end system that could cover all your gates / gathering points and requires operator(s) to work. 
-	Parking lots & the necessary street / logistic network around it could  be a great additional feature too

- Being able to regularly drop opps in one to two shots off direct hits (or get dropped yourself)
- Great ballistics engine despite the fact that the environment is not destructible

I'm riding high on the victory! Then I enter the next area, new well designed enemies to sink my whip into to feed my ever growing bloodlust. This however is where my journey ended , sadly not from me getting to cocky or being overwhelmed.. No the game froze and shut down.

"It's a nice game. I can't say it's for everyone, or that it's some kind of a 10/10 revelation that will blow your mind; but if you're the right type of player this game will give you many, many hours of joy and a unique world to explore.

Try it if you're a roleplayer looking for a vast, diverse RP community.
Try it if you want cohesive class-based action both casual and hardcore.
Try it if you want to have a bunch of classes on one character.
Try it if you want a vast crafting and gathering system with a market to match.
Try it if you want a welcoming and forgiving community.
Try it if you want immersion with great story arcs and music to match.
Try it if you like playing Barbie dress-up.

Don't try it if you hate unskippable storylines. Unless you want to throw a wad of cash to get a story skip item, you WILL have to do all the main story quests.
Don't try it if you can't stand inconsistent storyline quality. Some parts of it (mostly Heavensward and Shadowbringers) are brilliant, yet some are an overextended and yawn-inducing slog you have to power through.
Don't try it if you want multiple specializations for one class. One class - one playstyle, if you want another one you'll have to level another class. Unless you're an Arcanist, these guys get two (healer + damager) for one.
Don't try it if you want every cutscene to be voiced and uniquely animated. Mostly you'll see a succession of default animations with text.
Don't try it if you expect people in matchmaking to have a performance standard. The downside of a forgiving community is that clueless underperforming people have little incentive to improve, and anything remotely resembling an insult is a reportable offense.
Don't try it if you have an aversion for JRPG and Japanese culture in general. This is kinda self-explanatory.

Also PvP is in a weird place, it's not bad but it is unpopular. I can't really say you shouldn't come here for PvP, but I can't say you'll have a blast and consistent queue pops either.

"NieR: Automata is an action open world title created by legendary developer Platinum Games. When experiencing this game for the first time, it was a pleasure. When experiencing NieR for the second time it was eye opening. But when you finally finish this game for the 3rd time, the experience is sublime. Truly captivating action gameplay, phenomenal story, immersive interconnected world, and one of a kind soundtrack. This title is one of a kind experience, and made me rethink how other games are made, & structured. While I do think NeiR: Automata drags a little bit on the second run through, ultimately there are enough changes to make it a worthwhile experience. NieR: Automata is a truly worthwhile experience for anyone who plays games, and I would go as far to say it is one of the greatest games of the Xbox One/ PS4 era. 10/10 a true Masterclass",True

I'm not great at the multiplayer but I've enjoyed the games I've had there.  To me though, the co-op mode is where this game is at.  8-player squad play vs a superior force of enemy bots (which can be decently intelligent) with varied objectives and a real urgency to not get shot (owing to the respawn mechanics).  I also like how this game is not a victim of modern day political correctness and all sides are represented equally.  I definitely recommend this, especially if you have some friends to co-op with.",True
"This is what I have always wanted Harvest Moon to be: a farming simulator with supernatural elements, solid gameplay mechanics, fantasy action, and a LOT of replayability and content. You can spend MONTHS playing this game and still not be bored. It is LOADED with stuff to do, buy, and build. But let's get into the nitty gritty.

The gameplay is basically fantastic, with Harvest Moon-like controls and menu. However, they added new features to the gameplay and this control scheme to add new elements to the game (like fishing). One thing that struck me as interesting is that the weapon-wielding fighting system is very similar to the ""Ys"" series (after ""Oath of Felghana"") or ""Legend of Zelda"" on the SNES. This is a good thing, as both games had great fighting mechanics, and the blend well the Havest Moon style. 

The story and characters are fantastic, and some of your decisions have major consequences or benefits to the game. Mainly, this will determine which areas in the town/forest will be open for you at what point in the game, depending on what you prioritize and unlock. However, one major choice will be extremely important and will change your overall gaming experience. What I will say is that while I like the villager-friendship system, I wish it had a bigger effect on the overall game. That being said, I enjoyed each character's story and there is something to be said for the simple nature of it that makes the game more peaceful. 

There are a LOT of secret tips in this game that will help you. I strongly reccomend checking out youtube. And keep in mind that most items have SOME sort of use. 

Personally, I feel that this game is superior to Harvest Moon and Rune Factory in its simulation and mechanics. Harvest Moon falls short because, while it is the true origin of this style of farming simulation gameplay, Harvest Moon games tend to judge your progress at the end of the game and....well....you know.....they actually end. Harvest Moon games (with the exception of a few) tend to have an ending, which is aggrivating as heck when you've spent hours building that farm. 

Rune Factory had a different issue that Stardew Valley avoids entirely. While Rune Factory is a better looking game in terms of visual appeal and uses similar gameplay elements, it lacks Stardew Valley's humor and grace. Rune Factory struggles in that it bases and relies EVERYTHING on its villager friendship/romance system, preventing you from going to areas or doing certain things until you befriend/romance one of the people in town. Rune Factory is essentially more of a farming/dating sim hybrid, where the entire story centers around your romantic relationship with your chosen towns-person. This feels frustratingly limiting in a way, because it keeps you from accessing features of the game unless you focus on non-farming, non-adventuring tasks and character dialogue. Stardew Valley does not struggle with this issue, as EVERY CHOICE YOU MAKE IN THE GAME IS, AT ITS CORE, AN OPTION. There is a benefit to EVERY action and focus you take, and combining actions will give you greater rewards. There is no requirement for villager-friendship, but it is VERY beneficial. Want to focus on crops and cooking? Now you have access to enhanced healing items that help you work for longer time periods. Want to go dungeoneering? Now you have access to better equipment, new quests, and building materials. Want to combine these skills with construction? You can literally build items that gradually increase the value of your crops and products. And the list goes on and on and on. There is so much to do, and with some planning and strategy, you can literally do everything that the game has to offer and still be playing it for the fun of seeing how your farm can flourish.

With solid gameplay, limitless possibilities, and hours of fun and creativity, this is the best Fantasy Farm Simulation game that I have seen yet!",True

"This is an unofficial sequel to Half-Life: Opposing Force, set during the events of HL2. So, as you can see the reviews for this game are mixed. I'll talk about that in a little bit. For now, I'll explain why I love the game.

It's more action-packed, fun and thrilling gunplay just like Half-Life 2. There are quite a few mods out there that do a poor job of matching up to the source material, but this one pays its homage to HL2 while forging its own path, a rare balance I have trouble finding in mods/spinoffs. 

As far as the story goes, you're playing as Corporal Adrian Shepard, in an alternate reality where he's freed by the Vortigaunts to help defeat the Combine's forces in Nova Prospekt. You play through the prison and beyond, without spoilers, you go somewhere VERY cool. 

Let it be known that this is a serious challenge. Playing on Hard, I'd say it's probably 2x as hard as HL2 on Hard. There are some parts of the game where I had to use 100% of my ammo to survive, and then there are parts when I had way more than enough. There were times when I had to hide behind cover and wait to be pushed to surivive.

The Summer 2016 update that was pushed added some interesting stealth levels where the goal is to get to the end without getting detected. I think it's awesome that Richard, the developer, doesn't let having a finished product prevent him from adding new content. 

About the length of the game, it is a bit short, only about 3 + 1/2 hours, but I felt like it was a good length. Some people would prefer to get it on sale. I myself got it on sale, and I think $5 is a steal for this. If you need to play it right now, $10 isn't a price you'll regret.

Now, onto the game's controversial reputation. A lot of people had unrealistically high expectations at launch, because quite a few video game news sites toted that the mod was official. It's not. You can read Richard's full reasoning behind the reputation via this reddit post: https://redd.it/4uvw79

I think he tried his best and succeeded. Give his game a try, it's not almost flawless like HL2, but it's still a 9/10 title. If it's not for you, that's fine. By getting it, you've witnessed someone else's piece of art, and you can check it out again anytime.",True

New update after several years.. its an amazing game before the update. my fps sucks after.  But it was already dead.

"I have one of the retina Macbook Pros from 2015 and I've tried playing this game in two ways on this machine: on Windows 10, installed via bootcamp, and using Wine on the OS X installation. With a little bit of configuration, the game can be made to run on newer machines with minimum issues - it crashes when alt-tabbing out of a full screen window and the frame rate drops at times, but nothing game breaking.

Even though the game is not optimized for newer operating systems or Unix-based systems, it can be made to run well. There seems to be a ton of content for the low price of the game and, coming from having played Fallout 4 on the PS4, it's a very welcome RPG with a variety of impactful choices and surprisingly deep character customization while leveling.

"Shaking my head at all the posers in these reviews who praise the game but clearly never finished it. This game is heinous. I'm currently consulting with a firm of lawyers and we're fairly certain Miyazaki selling this to me counts as assault and battery. I wanted to enjoy it, and goddamn, I've pretty much mastered all Soulsborne games, so it should be manageable, I foolishly told myself as I loaded up From Software kicking my crotch: the video game. No, no, you're not prepared for this game from Soulsborne title. You think you've got a handle on the fighting system and you finally meet a boss that presents a considerable but reasonable challenge, and you feel good about yourself, and the boss is like ""OH HEY IT'S COOL THAT YOU COMPLETELY DISMEMBERED ME BUT HOW ABOUT I PICK UP MY MISSING PARTS AND START BREAKDANCING AROUND THE ARENA ATTACKING YOU WITH MY CUT OFF CHUNKS"". And you beat that after intense suffering and literal buckets of tears of impotent rage, move on, and they give you the same fucking thing again, BUT TWICE, AND AT THE SAME TIME.

THEY BRING BACK WINTER LANTERNS AND THEIR GODFORSAKEN FRENZY MECHANIC WHICH NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD EVER DARE CALL A GOOD OR FAIR OR HUMANE MECHANIC. Except they're more aggressive, and fuck with your controls, and also require items so you even deal damage to them, and they come back a lot, and when you think you're done, the NEXT ONE is UNDER the FUCKING WATER.

"COMPLETED MAIN GAME IN 10 HOURS

This game is a masterpeice, the grpahics are really really nice and can run beautifully even on my not-so-good grpahics card. At the start the game makes sense, find the girl to wipe away the debt then around mid game it begins to get complicated whether it be because i wasn't the most attentive to voxophones or became confused with dialogue but then at the end of the game everything makes sense. The gameplay is great and i thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience. 

the downside however would be, the fact that the game would've ended in about 3-4 hours if silly plot twists didn't happen, especially around the 3-4 hour mark. These plot twists happened way too much and I felt like Booker ""I have done everything, i don't need to know about your [spoiler]finger[/spoiler] can't we just go to Paris?"". If you came to this game for Bioshock im just saying Big Daddy makes no appearance and judging by the reviews of people who've played the series, it is not very similar to Bioshock. It could've easily been a standalone game with a cameo.

9/10 
-1 for plot twists frequency and sometimes confusing story moments

"All right, so I've now play a few hundred hours and my general thoughts are:
- It's in the Paradox genre, with enough depth to keep you interested for a while, BUT
- It's by far the worst Paradox game I've played.  There are a few reason for this which are:
1) It's a little dry/mechanical/repetitive.  Yes, there are fun and intersting events, but it doesn't ever get to the depth/feel of the better 4X games out there like civilisation or even the old Master of Orion.  It's hard to pinpoint exactly why, but perhaps it's too mechanical and not enough fun.
2) The AI sucks.  Of course, that's usually a problem, but here the AI is just too predictable.  It's too easy to goad them into war even if you're a peace loving pacifist, or buy them off if you don't want so they just leave you alone.
3) THE PERFORMANCE IS TERRIBLE in the late game.  This game, which really isn't actually that complex, grinds to a halt on all but the absolute best PCs (latest Intel i7 or equivalent) which just isn't good enough.  The AI seems to spend a huge amount of time doing minor/pointless things that grind up huge amounts of CPU time.  You end up watching your insta account just to give the computer time to crunch through the days/months/years.
4) It's a bit boring.  Am I repeating myself?  Yeah.  Dull.  The performance issues don't help.

So, as a long-time fan of Paradox, I have to give this the thumbs down.  Very down.

Game with a great potential but poor network code and poor network infrastructure. Game wants to be realistic on some points (recoils, weapons feeling) but allows some very fantasy actions like killing someone with one punch because you jump randomly at the right moment, right moment which you are unable to determine because of the poor network code.

Singleplayer: Tons of fun if you download some good stuff from the workshop ((I spent 70% of my time playing in Singleplayer))
Multiplayer: DarkRP is fun, and mainstream, but there are also some other fun gamemodes you can find. Also, if you see a server that has a max player count over 64, than prepare for performance problems, the Source Engine wasn't built for a High Player Count.

Overall: A great game, for its low price of 9.99 bux, I definetly recommend it to you.

"LISA.  What a game.

I can normally discuss games with relative ease, but LISA has me in a bit of a pinch.  The game is all over the place.  Funny.  Sad.  Creeped out.  Wholly depressed.  LISA is unrelenting, unrewarding, and unhappy.  If you aren't contemplating your life's decisions after a playthrough, you aren't paying attention.

LISA is an RPG that is heavily inspired by the Earthbound/Mother series.  It uses pixel graphics, and while that may seem ho-hum to the average gamer (since most games utilize pixel graphics), LISA pulls this off very well to give characters some personality, and also allow for some rather creepy images.

Combat is much the same as any RPG, save for a few characters.  All characters will begin with a standard ""Attack"", ""Skills"", ""Guard"", ""Items"" listing, however, the inclusion of combos will intice players to memorize specific commands to allow a few extra hits, and a skill use all in one move.  It's a pretty clever system.  Just realize that sometimes, you'll need two arms to do certain things.

So what's the story?  Well...  Without giving too much away, you are Brad.  Brad is the older brother to the titular character Lisa, who committed suicide prior to the game's events.  You discover Buddy, the (supposedly) only female left in existance after an apocalyptic event killed off many people (and all the women).  With nothing but testosterone flying around, and everyone looking to get laid, Buddy becomes a prime target of all the perverts around.  As Brad, your mission in life is to become Buddy's guardian, and atone for your past with what happened to your sister.

That being said, there's not a whole lot I can say that wouldn't be a massive spoiler.  The game is fairly linear, so you don't need to worry about getting lost too much.  There's a bit of exploration here and there, but you won't need to stray too far from the beaten path to get what you need.

Be warned:  LISA is not a game for people who have problems with the topic of sexual abuse or psychological issues.  This game does delve into some rather dark territory, and there's usually no happy resolution to even it all out.  When I said this game is wholly depressing, I meant it.  I played through, beat it, and felt empty inside.  Not because the game wasn't what I wanted, but that's how the game is.

You aren't supposed to feel good about your actions.  You aren't supposed to feel good about the situations.  You're not supposed to be happy.  You'll be empty by the end, and that was the goal from the start.

Don't let that ruin the experience, however.  It's seriously a fantastic game to play through, and a very unique experience to have.  It's a quick RPG with very little grinding needed (there's only a handful of places you can even grind anyway).  Do yourself a favor and plunk down a few bucks on this.  You wont regret it.  Or you might.  Kind of a mixture of both.",True

"The Best Game I've Ever Purchased!

Let me start off by saying that I really love gaming, and I spend lots of my free time playing games. Not only am I a fan of some indie games, but also larger franchise games, like Battlefield & GTA. Other kinds of games that are my favorite are Digital Combat Simulator and Flight Simulator X.

With that being said, I play a wide variety of games, simulators being one of them. 

Kerbal Space Program does not dissapoint as a simulator or as game. FIrst off, the freedom in the game is amazing. You have an entire solar system to yourself, and the difficulty to get from one planet to another makes the world just seem as big as it should.

Second of all, the fact that you build your own spacecraft really brings out the creativity in me. I've built so many crazy designs, but then also so many really good designs. Haveing the ability to build anything you want is amazing.

Third of all, the gameplay is great. Cockpit views, EVA's, docking, landing on other planets/moons. It's all so perfectly well done. A few features that I would like to see, are already confirmed to be in version 1.0 of KSP, such as multiplayer or extensive IVA's where you can move around inside your spacecraft. Whether you want to recreate real life spacecraft, or build your own unique designs, the gameplay supports pretty much anything your brain desires.

Lastly, I want to talk about the mods. Vanilla, this game already provides you with endless entertainement. However, the modding community is what makes this game what it is. Not only the fact that the modders spend so much time to perfect their mods, but also to make sure they update them for new versions of KSP. The dedicaiton is amazing. Moreover, the game becomes so amazingly fun with mods, if it wasnt' already a game to die for. So many mods you couldn't even think of, already exist. Some of my favorites are Kethane and B9, so check those out if you get game

In conclusion, the combination of the gameplay, freedom, open worldness and mods makes this game the best game I've ever played. I've spent countless of hours on this game, because I haven't played KSP through Steam in a while, as I directly run the x64.exe instead of running it through Steam, so my counter stopped working. I can guarantee you, however, that it is more than 800 hours at this point. Whether you love simulation, indie gaming, open world games, space exploration or flight, this game is a must have!",True

Liberty Prime, a communist-seeking death-machine VS. Terminator inspired college students.  420/10 IGN",True
"I've had this game since it came out in early access. I realize I have only clocked 13.5 hours in game time, but in a game like this that is actually quite a bit as each level, on average, takes about 6 minutes to complete. In the beginning of early access there was significantly less levels and content as there is now, the developers have added a bunch and it really shows. The codex system used to be different, there was never mutations, and they have added a crap ton of new weapons and abilities since day one. You can really tell the devs care about the game. While it does reward you for quickly completing the levels, it isn't a requirement as the gold bonus you receive for time doors can almost be acheived by just completing every inch of a level before progressing. The twitch integration was a nice surprise. The RNG of the weapon/amulet/shop per generation can be frustrating at times, with some runs giving you OP configurations and others leaving you with bread crumbs however that is also part of the appeal of the game. It forces you to think of new strategies and adapt, rendering it virtually infinitely replayable. The bosses are not neccesarily as interesting as, say, metroid bosses (comparing since this is called metroidvania) but the levels between them are memorable (shout out to Ramparts). The graphics are unique yet familiar, the music melds well with each level and the minimalistic story (the one thing I will say can be compared to Dark Souls) keeps the world a mystery and lets you focus on the combat. The animations are fluid and satisfying. Dodging, rolling through doors and slamming to the ground feel visceral and meaningful (shout out to Spartan Sandals). The parry mechanic is exciting and means the combos you can achieve with various items are fun to pull off. Get this game, it's worth it and you'll find yourself picking it up to play when you get tired of fortnite. 9/10.",True
"The words I have to explain this are not very nice so lets keep it civil.

- Horrible servers - connection issues and have seen people dropped from game at various times including top 5
- Prone to crazy bugs (saw an immortal player model walk in a straight line across the whole map)
- Absolutely no hype, dead servers. You will sit in lobby for a while

"Brilliant and entertaining puzzle game.  Fun, dark humor.  Occasionally quite abstract and non sequitur, with portal-esque dystopian overtones.  Many nods to games in the same genre. I suggest having lots of scratch paper handy.  The premise is deceptively simple: all the puzzles take place in one non-descript control room, but the number of puzzles per unit volume is surprisingly high.    After about 10 hours, the puzzles get progressively harder to solve (find!), but it is worth the journey if you like puzzle games.  The 3D enviornment ads a really nice touch.",True

"Excellent game for designing realistic railroads with subtle elevation changes through broken terrain where finding a good route is very important instead of just plopping down a line from a top down view, but when it's time to operate the routes the game is annoying and is very specific about how it wants you to transport the goods in terms of frequency of loading/unloading, time or distance so your realistic or desired line may fail due to unrealistic factors. You're not in control of your operation, the game's arbitrary decisions.

There is no AI competition so initial challenge is artificially made harder to compensate but once you snowball enough income it turns into a sandbox anyway, and yet you can't run the lines like a sandbox.

I've played many transport building games since Transport Tycoon Deluxe and this is one of the few which didn't satisfy me at all, except for the building part. I would only recommend this if you are highly interested in building more realistic railroads with limits in grade change through terrain like a surveyor but don't care about actually running them.",False
"The Tomb Raider games strangely followed the exact production problems of the Batman: Arkham games. A series which, over time mistook quality for quantity and just kept adding more, and more and more. This game then is the Arkham Knight step of the trilogy, a game that still has all of the great things present in the first and second game, but is now so bloated with nonsense that it's become obvious that the developers didn't have enough time to polish this game. 

So what does that mean? The game has a staggering amount of content and my 27 hours with the game encompasses a pretty thorough first play-through. It also means the game is rife with bugs, and for a lack of a better word ""Jank"". Your hook will miss, a lot, Lara will often not grab onto things when she should, and you will jump in an unintended direction plenty of times during Lara's homicidal rampage through the game.

The story, I think, is the weakest of the 3, which is frustrating cause the setting I think is the best. Characters are all massive stereotypes and by the time you get to the meat of the story you realise that you don't care about anyone anywhere.

So should you buy it? Sure, if you played the other 2 it at least continues that story functionally. Do wait for a sale though, 50% or more at minimum.",True

"Honest review. 

In The Bunker, a 30ish yo feeble and infantilized lad suffering from post traumatic aftermath explores the bunker he spent his life in after his mother passes away. You can read her Treasure Island which lies by her bedside table, nice, moving on. 

With an interactive movie like The Late Shift in mind, I was very disappointed by the limited interactivity this game had to offer. Not sure how it's an 'award-winning' game tbh. Maybe it's just me who had the wrong expectations. The intrigue is quite stale and the gameplay, linear, or virtually inexistent. Simply put, your 'choices' do not matter since you don't really make any.

"Commenting on a game like this almost requires someone with a proper sense of poetry, because artful words are necessary to communicate the experience.  Proteus isn't a ""game"" in any sense of the word but rather a literal experience to discover and explore.  To that end I encourage you to play this in a manner which best allows you to immerse yourself and let Proteus BE your world for a little while.  Play in the dark with headphones on and toss out your preconceived ideas for what you should see and do.  

If you can approach Proteus in this way you'll find a tangible sense of wonder and intrigue as you are presented with details that are both familiar (land, trees, mountains) and unfamiliar like pixel presentations that alter your perception of what's normal along with an everpresent sense of music and interplay as your participation in the world changes the experience.  There are sights and things here to capture your imagination if you spend the time to take the world on its own terms.  

With that being said Proteus is rather short and repetitive.  The whole world is procedurally generated which in theory means that every time you play you'll be greeted with an entirely different island than you ever visited before, but there are certain rules about the lay of the land which remain consistent and so the wonderful sense of new discovery can fade over repeated plays.  This doesn't diminish the enjoyment of the game any more than repeated trips to your favorite campground at a national park can make you tired of going back, but one of the primary appeals is that sense of discovery where you're confronted with a world that's simultaneously familiar but alien. 

...so despite playing the game several times now I still feel like there's more yet I haven't found.  I'll come back again.",True

Always fun to come back to after all these years and alot of fun to play with friends.,True
"Such a beautiful game. There is a lot of heart put into it and it definitely shows. The artwork is surreal, and the voice acting is simply superb. Erin Yvette, the voice actor who plays the protagonist Alex, has done a phenomenal job and the game wouldn't have worked as well if that character wasn't relatable enough. It's a superb experience, highly recommended.",True
"I have sunken a lot of hours into this game. While this game does provide gameplay that cannot be found elsewhere -- it does so with such horrible execution. My thoughts and observations:
- Every patch introduces new bugs
- They are very slow to fix issues
- There is a clear move towards prioritizing microtransactional content versus fixing those bugs
- Gunplay is pretty decent
- Their latest map is much smaller, and makes for a better experience than Erangel and Miramar

Would I ever recommend this game? Their clear move towards green, and the shitty maintenance of the game despite having a lot of funds, points me to say no.",False

"This game is fun  if you are looking to go online, a view bugs but overall the game is good",True

"Note: You don't need to play [i]The Men of Yoshiwara: Kikuya[/i] in order to play this game and this game does not spoil anything in the previous game. This review is based off of one playthrough, though.

Honestly, this game is very similar to Kikuya in terms of general plot, but the characters make it different. This review will be similar to the one I've made for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sakoori-kun/recommended/381100/]Kikuya[/url].

Pros
[list]
[*] Five romancable guys
[*] Steam achievements
[*] Lots of hours worth of reading
[*] Same artwork as Kikuya
[/list]

Neutrals
[list]
[*] They reused some of the artwork from Kikuya
[*] The characters somewhat mirror the characters in Kikuya
[*] Typos/grammar problems in the English translation 
[*] There are less chapters per route in Ohgiya than in Kikuya, which isn't a bad thing, but it's personal preference
[/list]

Cons
[list]
[*] Again, the music just loops itself after a while, like in Kikuya
[*] There is no mobile port for this to my knowledge, so you can't do a ""test run"" like you can with Kikuya
[*] Formatted in a way that makes it seem like it's still a PC port of a mobile game, which it's not.
[*] The price might be a setback
[/list]

I expected the same quality and result from playing Ohgiya due to the fact that I played Kikuya already. Ohgiya didn't disappoint me but it also felt kind of like a repeat of Kikuya. I loved Kikuya, so this isn't a problem for me. The publishers fixed a lot from Kikuya when they made Ohgiya, so that was something nice to see in the end. 8/10",True

There are NO rules in rust. But with this comes the pitfalls. there are no rules, making this a game with surprisingly little trust. there are no rules, making this game one of the most toxic games you will ever play, if not the most.

"Let me tell you a story. A story about this game and its long standing problems. In 2008 I purchased Garry's Mod because of some shitty Machinima. I was still a kid, just barely out of 7th Grade, I didn't know about the problems. Today I do. This game suffers from a few really horrible things.

1. Children
Seriously. I mean Children, like 3 to 5 year old children play this game. Why?
2. Greedy Server Owners
Mark Q. Clark AKA Killshit AKA Shitslick AKA Killslick leads this. He is terrible. He is greedy. He does nothing himself, and he DDOSs and DMCA's other communities into submission because he is a greedy little snot-nosed kike with one hand.

Overall the game is pretty alright, but it has lots of problems.",True
"Playing SOTS 2 makes me want to play SOTS 1. I can see how they might have felt like they were making improvements to the SOTS concept. But they did such an unbelievably bad job putting the whole thing together that it blows my mind.

The user interface is atrocious. It's difficult to figure out how to do things that should be simple. I can't always tell what can and can't be interacted with. I'll give you a tip there by letting you know that most of what you see cannot be interacted with. The more I played the game, the more convinced I became that the game was intentionally designed to make gameplay as difficult and confusing as possible.

The game runs slowly in different ways. Even the game menu feels sluggish. It's even worse when you're actually in the game. The first time I clicked ""next turn"" it took 5-10 seconds to process the turn, which gives me nightmares about how long it might take in the late game when the map is fully populated.

The combat is much less intuitive than SOTS 1. It was very noisy, but I couldn't really see what was happening. I couldn't see any of the little laser beams or plasma cannon shots flying around. Just missles graphics cutting in and out. I think they redesigned things to look more realistic, but the end result was that it looked like garbage compared to SOTS 1.

Based on User Interface alone, I think the game developers should be ashamed of themselves. It's so bad, that I would actually rather do math homework.",False
"If you're a sci-fi nerd who likes futuristic battles, this game is for you. While DLCs provide small changes and doesn't have much impact on the game (additions aren't that many imo), it does satisfy your dying thirst for mech battles.

"Essentially the greatest survival game ever with MMO options.

I personally play single player almost exclusively due to internet restrictions so anyone who tells you they dont like the game because its ""hard"" or ""everyone online is a dick"" or ""they ruined it with tek tier waaaaaa"" is missing one key point:

You literally can setup this game ANY WAY you want to play it....

Here are some complaints I hear and handy tips on how to solve them;

I dont like Tek Tier-
Dont use it

People on the servers are mean-
Make your own

*insert dino name here* is so OP-
Get rid of it in your game spawns or nerf it's stats

Taming is hard-
Nerf it in server settings

I dont see ""insert dino here""-
You can easily add it to spawn whereever you want it too (Game.ini)

It gets boring on single player after you build good defenses-
Add some Gigas to spawn in game near your base, really see how good that defense is

This game is unfinished and buggy-
It's early access, kind of the point of early access

Wildcard is money hungry with paid DLC-
Don't buy it, it is COMPLETELY optional. Also those of us who spent the money on it may not mind because we enjoy it (food for thought)

The game is lacking *insert feature here*-
The community has a mod for just about everything you could think of and if it doesnt have it you can try your best to make it happen with the Mod Tools

Sooooo look guys my final thoughts are this:

The game is amazing and has seemingly limitless potential to become anything you want it to be so if you lack these 5 key characteristics; motivation, imagination, patience, a basic logical reasoning method, and the ability to read, than yes this game may not be for you.

However if you can pull yourself out of that ""should work perfect out the box"" mentality I promise you, you will be able to sink damn near 1000hrs into this game without ever even logging into a server other than your own.

" The best game I've played in sandbox category. If your imagination has no limits, then there isn't any limits to do in game.  The game isn't only for building, you have to improve your characters with new things you've to find or craft, you have to fight the bosses which every each one has a unique style and item drops, survive the different events and enemies.
 As you understand this game is perfect at allowing player to use his/her imagination to the utmost.",True

"Awesome game, tons of fun. Although it is a bit short of a game, you can beat the game twice in about 6 hours. (Mind you I accidently left the game on one night so I kind of have twice that logged). It's even a great game to be competitive with for speed running since you can get through it in less than half an hour. Where the game lacks is the characters; You'll manly be playing as Vienna due to her speed and high jump ability making it easier to get places and Nyn for her destructive swordplay. Brent could have been better if the magic system was a little more forgiving on mana regen.

TLDR Section~
Pros:
- Good animation
- Awesome art style
- Fun... Lots of fun.
- Each character feels unique and their playstyles are actually disguishable
- Well written story with a hilarious abridged version available.
- The music is epic.

Cons:
- Short. As you can tell by reading the other comments, people have only put in 3-6 hours and 100% the game.
- Character swap mechanic is underutilized.
- Dance of the Gnomes aka The Toll-A-Warp music.",True
"When you first start playing the game and dont know anything about it or how it works, you feel a little overwhelmed. 7DTD gives the survival feeling pretty hard. Once you get around a bit and find some stuff from scavaging the game does get a lot eaisier.

Crafting- 7DTD is all about it. I was very surprised at the amount of things you can make at the start. Theres also tons of patterns that come in the form of books that teach you other things from repair tools to weapons, armor and ammo.

                       -Building: Scavaging isnt the only thing to do to get items. Once you find a location either a premade building or a place that you feel you can defend you can start building up a defence around said building or create a stronghold of your own. In the crafting menu you can also create building materials such as wood planks and pillars to concrete blocks to make your own structures. The repair tool is really useful because not only can you fix damaged structures you can also upgrade them to be more durable and take more damage before breaking.

Multiplayer- The game is really driven towards grouping up with allies and defending against the endless mobs of zombies. After you have spent time developing a central location or base with your friends the zombies spawn entire hordes that attack you at random times through out the day and these hordes can be quite large, at least 40-100 plus mobs.

                        -Pvp: Yes, you can choose to hunt other players down and kill them for there fat loots :) most of the time the random people you encounter on the servers want to group up, others shoot or attack you on sight with out warning.  


In the end this is a great game that is still only in alpha. The latest Alpha 9 patch is really solid. I would recomend this game to any of my friends looking for something new or just enjoy playing survival type games. I will continue to play and look forward to furture updates and eventually the offical launch.",True

Well for starters its a bit f-ed up but the whole time i was playing was a bit of a mind fuck (Story wise) but the gameplay overall is comepletely simple and not hard for new gamers out their.its a simple pick up and play if i do say so myself. The graphics are not so bad but there are 3 cutscenes I think most viewers will be sickened by.So if you are weak to bloody animations I wouldn't recommend it.the game overall is really terrifying and overall a nightmare like the games title.but I will say the game is definately better then a game that crashes all the time.So it gets a 7.9/10 over all its a pretty good game,recommend it if your into horror",True

"It's hard to give an unbiased review of a Souls game, being the unabashed fan that I am, but let me try and give a short, and hopefully useful breakdown of the pros and cons of the supposedly final entry in the series.

Pros:
-Trademark breathtaking settings
-Punishing difficulty
-Variety of approaches to combat
-Beautiful yet depressing atmosphere
-Nods to previous series entries
-Sorcery is no longer ridiculously overpowered (caveat in the cons, though)
-Beautiful visual design, models, armor, weapons, and monsters
-Visual variety for Fashion Souls
-Co-op changes to matchmaking (passwords!)
-Rich story to discover rather than have fed to you
-Faster paced combat opens new possibilities and approaches
-New weapon types and abilities!
-New Covenant system is very convenient
-Final boss for first DLC is one of the most amazing fights in the series!

Cons:
-More linear than your usual Souls game
-The usual framerate stuttering in some areas
-Changes to sorcery make it significantly less viable
-Somewhat easier than other entries in the series
-A couple of segments and bosses are out and out cheap rather than difficult, which kind of breaks up the spirit of the usual hard but fair model
-Maybe no more Souls games after this!
-Invasions made more complicated by higher limit of summoned friendly phantoms
-Both DLCs are...quite short",True

The game play is fantastic, the design from street to the environment is fantastic, and the music... OMG THE MUSIC!

"I just love this game.
Yes, it is quite old by now, but for me it is still one of the best ARPGs ever made.
I had this games on disk years ago, and have many fond memories.
I think the difficulty is spot on, the party system is great and there is even something of a ""story"".

I also can not complain that it does not run- I have no problem running the game on my
windows 8.1 laptop 64bit.

Of course I have to agree that it is sad that the expansion ""Legends of Aranna"" is missing,
but what can you do when stuck in a mire of copyright politics?

Also, and that is the AWESOME part, there is a MOD which lets you play the Multiplayer map
as a singleplayer- with a party. This gives you many more hours of gameplay (it is longer than
the included singleplayer campaign).
It even has a better story than the singleplayer campaign!

And yes, it runs fine on the steam version and gets around the problem with the blocked multiplayer.

"Fantastic game!

Pros:
+Artstyle obviously. I was never a big fan of rubberhose cartoons, most tended to creep me out. But it works so very goddamn well for this game
+Difficulty. It's very managable if you're into the challenge. Normally I hate bullet hells (not sure if I'm using the term correctly here), but the MUSIC and the fun presentation just keeps you going. ADVICE! Try to vary your weapon from time to time if a boss seems stupidly hard. One boss in particular was finished surprisingly easy for me after I switched weapons (+I was in the zone a little bit I guess).
+I think the Dark Souls comparison is adequate, in that you get a hard but fair challenge. Some boss phases which are random seemed a bit unfair to me though, but only in a couple of moments. Overall it's really managable imo.
+Music: Greeeeaaat! Fun upstep Jazz or whatever it is, played by a real orchestra and it keeps the mood up, and the action funky.
+Very good number of beautiful bosses

"The choice of deployable units is somewhat limited, the vehicle, terrain and building damage physics are pretty detailed (tanks can be disabled in a number of ways, buildings can be either partially or completely destroyed, aircraft bombs, artillery and tank rounds leave craters in the terrain), the only downside is the length of the campaign (there are quite a few campaign choices) but they're all less than 10 missions long.

"In all honesty this game wasnt as bad as I expected, after hearing from several sources that this is ""the worst game on steam"".

The concept is a fairly orthodox puzzle game where you place objects on the stage and then click a button to set it into motion.
The problem is with the excecution of above concept. The physics engine is akward, maybe in some ways too precise? As a result, you must place various objects in EXCATLY their correct positions. Even if you know how the puzzle is to be solved, it may take a while to make tiny adjustments.

"This game saved my life.

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Are there still glitches in the main game, yes. Are all games perfect and do they run well on every machine? Idiotic question. All of the glitches I've run into with this game are pretty standard.

"If you like god games BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW. This game succedes where others have failed by creating a great and simple system to control your world with: instead of controlling the world itself like other games (changing the water level, or affecting the landscape), you create ''commandements'' that dictate how your people react to what's around them and in what way they react to them, which can be anything from telling them that people about to die shouldn't eat food since they're going to be wasting ressources, to creating commandements just for shits and giggles like telling unhappy people to kill happy people and basicaly creating the purge. This game is VERY active and it's developpers are still working on it. please support them, they deserve it. If I could think of anything that would increase my fun in this game than I am right now, it would be to add more identification symbols. Tribes ands or cities identify themselfs with flags and each flag has a symbol, but I think they're all independant and somtimes the same flag/symbol will appear multiple times per map creating a confusing situation where you're not fully certain weither or not they're part of the same nation or if they're just seperate parties under the same flag. Another awesome thing to add would be to make a way for commandements to affect specific things such as animals and maybe even plant life instead of just people (ex: lions consume antelopes, trees grow more on desert, etc). Other than features though, the ai has a few problems with pathing and logistics, many times a game has ended not because my people, but because they were stuck perpetualy moving in circles or endlessly trying to break down buildings all the while, for some incomprehensible reason, not dying off from hunger or lack of ressources. Also, from time to time, followers tend to ignore the commandements given to them like me telling them to move to a different biome only for them to decide to NOT do that and just keep killing each other. All in all though, this game DESERVES to be worked on and its devs deserve some praise. This game has great potential, and like I said, it succedes where others have failed (i.e, Godus). 11/10, can't wait for the next update.",True
"A realistic military simulation but not as realistic as ARMA, so if you are a newbie like me it's still quite easy to understand most of the game's mechanics. Don't expect this to be action-packed, but once you have some action it will be very immersive and rewarding. And because communication is very important in this game, the full experience can only be achieved when the chain of command in your team communicate well. I recommend this game if you are an FPS fan like me and looking for something different than, say, CS:GO, COD, or Battlefield and want to immerse yourselves in a military simulation game.",True

"My biggest dissapointment for a long time.

I'm no stranger to difficulty, nor XCOM and turn-based strategy games are one of the things I love the most.  I'm in the middle of beating a different one on the hardest difficulty in fact.  I enjoyed the 2012 XCOM quite a lot - it had a lot going for it where you had diverse upgrades to do, a world to defend, random events and interesting aliens.

XCOM 2 feels like a subcontracted out game where the developers have never played an XCOM game before but they copied the source code for the first game and watched a stream of it on Twitch.  Instead of using RNG to cause tense moments and force you to adapt your plans, they've cranked it up twofold in comparison to the previous XCOM, meaning your choices start to not even matter since rather than occasionally having speedbumps and lucky hits, depending on how the mission and hit RNG feels, it varies from a cakewalk where no one gets injured and an impossible mission where everyone dies.  Unlike the previous titles, XCOM 2 feels like 20% is player input, with the rest being loadout and RNG, which is quite a shame because despite how awful the FPS was, I was still looking forward to an XCOM game.  

I just don't even know what else to say.  They've made few changes in terms of mechanics, yet the changes they have made are all unreasonably drastic and far outside what any sane person would expect.  The premise is solid too, but I just don't understand how it went so horribly wrong.  I'd recommend just playing a modded XCOM or Xenonauts, which is a retake of the classic XCOM that I enjoyed quite a lot despite being released in 2014 wtih 1990 graphics.",False
"You think Skyrim is the biggest open world game, then you havent played Just Cause 2. This is by far the biggest open world game to date making Skyrim look like chopped liver compared to the magnitude of this game. 

So you play as Rico an agent set to cause unwarranted amounts of destruction to overthrow a dictator on a foreign island or i should say islands. The story itself is boring and just plain silly as well as the awful characters but the rest of the game, the gameplay especially is the real treat of this game. Exploring the open world, doing races, causing tons of destruction, there are just countless amounts of things you can do and I must make mention that there is a multiplayer mod where you can join up with dozens of players in this HUGE open world game, you MUST try the mod.

This is the best open world game I have ever played to date and I cannot recommend it enough. It certainly has its clear flaws but this game should not be overlooked by anyone looking to cause pure chaos in a wartorn land.

[b]The game is easy[/b] (you can do medium mission straight out and hard within 10-20 minutes of gameplay, Audacious level of difficulty is no more difficult really... I've just unlocked ""mistake"" difficulty so hey maybe that'll finally be a challenge.

I'd like to see a bit more story and progression in the game, I think that would really hook me, but hey they kind of mentioned in the store page that the story isn't a focus. Shame though because I think that could propel this game to the next level.

"I like Rogue Empire.
I have an in-progress Lets Play here: https://youtu.be/S6060krRpWU 

Rogue Empire: Dungeon Crawler RPG is a descriptively named Indie, Traditional Rogue-Like RPG by Portal Entertainment.  
It Is Good.  Enjoy Procedural Generation and Optional PermaDeath! 
Thats Right, I said Optional: You can turn the Perma Death off if it's not your thing. It's my thing. 

Rogue Empire is a traditional Rogue-Like that combines the best of ADoM (Ancient Domains Of Mystery), with a bit of TOME (Tales of Maj'Eyal), to create an experience that is greater than the sum of its parts.  

It's more polished then ADoM, with big, larger buttons for the inventory, and skills; everything is just presented CLEANER.  ADoM is still based off ASCII, though with an excellent build-in tileset, but the old inventory test list display can seem less then welcoming.  Rogue Empire also has EXCELLENT music! 

And graphically, the world just seems more Alive.  
Monsters will pulse with Power, damage numbers or Crits will flash on screen, elemental effects will vividly display, like being lit on Fire, or Frozen to the ground; all this helps bring a sense of action and motion to a turn-based game. 

Unlike TOME, Rogue Empire pushes you forward by your character's need to eat, the need to collect and use consumables like potions, scrolls, and wands, and to ultimately prevent the world from literally fading into evil (purple miasma cloud of doom).  
I've also found TOME just LESS of a rogue-like then either ADoM or Rogue Empire; the removal of so many of the old standbys of the genre (hunger, consumables, cursed items), and the replacement of it with a cooldown driven ability and dps rotation, changes ALOT of things.  
Not that I mind; if they were all the same, what would be the point of playing more than one? 

In short, Rogue Empire has the lethality of AdoM, with the abilities and cooldowns of TOME.                         
Rogue Empire presents a nice balance between the hard-core crunch of AdoM, and the streamlined nature of TOME; I like them both, but I find when I'm hankering for a Rogue-like, I reach for Rogue Empire . :)    

Really cool Art too! 👍",True

Did I want to be longer than it was?  No, why would I want more of the same boring (non-)gameplay?

I lost a lot of respect for many reviewers after all the raves this game got.  Change Lonnie from a female to a male and 99% of the game would be exactly as it is now, the game would lose its political agenda, and I suspect that, without that agenda, this game would have been rightfully ignored.

"I have enjoyed this Party Pack immensely, with family, friends and even on Twitch. Especially now in unprecedented times. Allow me to explain.

Quiplash 2 expands a lot into what made the first one (and by extension, XL) so good! You can even make custom episodes with your own prompts! Or you can play the regular version, but still get laughs. Trivia Murder Party, to this day, is my favourite JBG of all time (even surpassing You Don't Know Jack). Yes, the obscure trivia may be a turn off for some, but I enjoy it as well as the minigames. Guesspionage is nice with the guessing of precentages of polls. Tee K.O. is a blast, with the colourful drawings and slogans players can make (when appropriate, of course). Fakin' It is the weak link of the pack, due to it requiring actual people in the room. It may be hard to pull off over Twitch, but possible on something with video chat (Zoom, Discord, etc.)

To this day, I still love this pack and will never get bored of it. I think you will, too.",True
"What is Battle Brothers?

It is a Round base Strategie Game, where you are a mercenary that go around und build step by step your Troups.

With time you fight Bandit Thugs und Raiders, Orcs, Goblins, Nachtzehrer, Zombie, Necromancer Skelleten and Honor Guards.

 A Game, where every wrong step can cost one or more of your Guys that was with you. A Game, where YOU  can Decide what for weapons your men get ,what there specials are and where there stand.

I have Play now this game ONLY 55 hours, but I still like it. Specialy when it come to late game Events, like the Undead Plague, that can raid the villages and Castles where you are normaly get your quests.

It is still in the Beta Game, but the devs have made a good Job for now and they are search and develop still more in this game.

"Its been in Alpha for 2-3 years now. Its not getting better. Was a few months since I last played, and now its more laggy, characters gets wiped almost every relog. 

Its still a fun game in essence, but I fear it will never be complete at this backwards rate. Which makes me sad since all the alternatives out there are going for the more arcade-feel. 

I like the harsh and rugged reality of DayZ SA, I really do. 
But when the character wont even stay saved for 6 hours, it feels like such a hug waste of time. 
I literally only have time to loot up some basic clothes and a damaged melee weapon. It takes such long time to start a character, and whenever I need to go eat, or do some groceries, its all wiped. 

I wasted half a day now, looted so much stuff, did not die once. And I have nothing to show for it.
Its an alpha yes, but even that has a limit before it gets tiresome. I would be fine with wipes if I could at least see some progress. 

But for every new item they add I feel they break equally many lines of code. I just don't understand how the game can feel less optimized and less stable every time I return in hope of seeing something new. 

Don't get me wrong, they do work on it, and they do add a lot of stuff, but its only large new areas, new items and a lot of energy spent into creating animals and cooking. 
But I feel that in the midst of all that, they loose track on making the base game stable and playable. 

Adding zones and loot comes later, right now it feels like they are desperatly trying to keep the players interested instead of putting focus on finishing the code and engine. 

If they cant keep the characters saved or the servers running smoth and laggfree, dont spend months on adding veichles just because other games have them. Its like their plan is dividing into way to many sidetracks and time is lost.

Maybe I just had a bad day, and maybe I'm just butt-hurt for loosing my char 3 times in a day without dying. 
But I know I'm not the only one feeling frustrated about it. And I know many share my feeling that way to much time and effort are spend on adding bling instead of finishing the ground.",False

Those radio boxes hanging on enemy antennas, they disappears at 300 meters, those are also important targets, the game doesn't let me know which setting to go for, if there are any.

"I really love Killing Floor 2! It's an awesome amount of fun and I would highly recommend it to anyone into that sort of thing! :)

It's a fast paced action shooting spree with an emphasis on good team work. If you find yourself on a lousy team or one trhat doesn't work together you'll find you're not long for this world. I love this aspect as it adds a real challenge and makes it a lot of fun.

My minus points:

I think the money/purchasing side of things could do with some work. There are times when people with a bunch of cash seem to donate you a load but apart from that it seems quite hard to come by and the time limit is pretty small get to the next pod and get tooled up before the next wave of Z's.

The single player campaign I feel could do with some extra bots on your side, as being a single player in this game on your own you get slaughtered pretty quick and it would be handy to be able to play with a bot team to hone your skills sometimes, tho I appreciate this is an MMO! :)

There does seem to be a lot of custom maps out there but precious few servers using them. Maybe that's just me and my location/ping rate but it seems a shame. Updates to the game are also slow in coming it seems although they have been promised a while ago.

All in all I rate this game 7/10 - Pretty excellent :)

-1.5 for update speed
-0.5 for lack of custom map servers, and -1 for lack of single player ability.

Edit: There seems to be a massive update download happening as I type, so I'll kee you posted!",True

"I stayed paralysed 10 minutes on the final scene, unable to make a choice. 
(Yeah, well, I have the same problem in my real life, from time to time :) )

Anyway, to start, there is a quote I want to whisper you first: 
""The stories we tell literally make the world. If you want to change the world, you need to change your story."" 

""Whispered World"" is all about that inner voice, accompanying you through a little old school point-and-click adventure, full of childish handmade fantasy and captivating autumnal music. (To compare the music : If you like the beautiful Coeur de Pirate's score she made for ""Child of Light"" and her ""Pilgrims"" track, or the game ""Brothers, a tale of two sons"")
Dialogues with the main character 'Sadwick' are well written. It is fun, colorful, lot of humor, sarcastic, ironic, exaggerated, while you resolve all kind of puzzles along your path to progress in his adventure. 
But at the end, it is all just about Sadwick, really. A little anti-hero protagonist, a sad little jester clown who trusts and loves everyone but himself.

Unexpectedly, Sadwick made me laugh, I felt amused, he made me hesitate, i got some smily pity, and cared about him. I got proud, yet felt sad. But mostly, it is the vibration of his deep darker clownesque-side that had a call on me. Certainly because the character development illustrates perfectly what's the ""Impostor Syndrome"" some of us are struggling with. With a final stage that literally blocked me.

This game is for youngers. And olders. Because -whatever the age- we all have a Sadwick inside ourselves. 
Being oversensitive to melancholy, Sadwick took me back right into one of my favorite books : The Little Prince. While playing, I kept asking myself : what if this voice we hear all along is some version of Saint-Exupery, and that Sadwick himself was some kind of his unlucky ""Little Prince"". If you know the book, you understand the meaning of laughing stars up your head.
(Anyway, no spoiler, I'll let you discover Whispered World by yourself.)

Is this game perfect? No. But who cares? 
Scriptwriter McKee wrote ""Storytelling is the most powerful way to put ideas into the world today.""
Well, the storytelling of ""Whispered World"" does exactly that. It brings you somewhere else. And when you come back from that place, you get to echoes things a bit differently. And just for that, this little journey in a Whispered World is totally worth it.

Cheers to all the clowns out there.",True
"It will take a little while to internalize the balance of food, supplies, and construction, but it's worth every second.  Although I will not pretend that I wouldn't like an expansion (or a sequel), this is one of the finest civilization builders ever made.  It's real-time, though you have a good variety of game speeds which you can change back and forth as needed.  There is no combat of any kind, but the harshness of winter and the occasional disaster can take a toll just as heavy.  Watching your people get pushed to the brink so early only to forge on in honor of their lost ones is inspiring, and you really can get attached to the tiny people.  If you like strategic building, this is in the highest tier.",True

The crafting system is very simple and easy to learn. Combat is quick and to the point once you get used to it. There is alot of gear and loot in the world, and enemies generally drop decent loot. I do reccomend this game, but only to people that can look past its unfinished and flawed cover, and find the game beneath all the bugs.",True

"First off this game does seem similiar to what you would expect in an early access... regardless I still recommend this game. I'm going to start with the cons then transition to the pros I find in this game.

Cons:
a) Many bugs. The scope will sometimes bug out and it wont actually scope in and there is NO fix other than restarting (this applies to most bug's solutions). The terrain can be buggy in certain parts of the reservatins, mainly in the mountains because you can prone and see under the map. There are more smaller ones but those are the ones I encounter frequently.
b) Multiplayer is near useless. If you want to get the full experience of the game I think the multiplayer actually TAKES from the experience. Only the host can interact with things on the reservation. The game has no tracker for who has the highest trophy score at the moment. The only semi-fun thing you can do with your friends is the multiplayer challenges. 
c) I'm not 100% sure about this but I'm pretty sure the game is poorly optimized. There are areas in the reservations which fps drops to hell, these points wont even make sense why it's dropping (I've gotten fps drop looking at the face of the rock). If you encounter a herd of deer and they all begin to trot or run at the same time the game can completely shit itself, I've had some friend's games crash because of this.

Pros:
a) The game is beautiful, I don't think I need to elaborate.
b) Guns feel great, it definitely has a pretty good selection to choose from. The integrity mechanic regarding the guns is a good way to incite diversity in your hunting. The grind that it takes to get better weapons is also fun imo, some people may shy away from grinding but it's nice to not run through a game in < 20 hours.
c) Every patch makes this game almost 2x better. Their polishing the gameplay and fixing bugs each patch and I'm assuming they'll move on to more 'fun' additions to the game. The developers are listening to the community which is nice, the changes are coming and that's all I really need to know for the future of this game's development.

Verdict: Basically early access but worth the price. Not for the impatient players.",True

I have a genuine Windows 10 Home Edition, that's where the game doesn't work; however, it is worth mentioning that the game works fine, (with internet and all), on Windows 7.

"Holy dingle-dongs, this game is amazing and is definitely a huge recommendation for a group of friends who want to spend hours together fighting through hordes. Scaling in difficulty as time goes, the game encourages fast-paced players who can speedrun with ease, but also gives beautiful scenery in every level and the soundtrack is up there with the greats in my personal opinion. 

Albeit since it IS early access as of me typing this, Risk of Rain 2 has certainly been built and designed with so much love in it from the character, enemy, and equipment designs and mechanics, to the satisfying gameplay and awe-inspiring atmosphere that the worlds create.

I bought the game on sale for $7.50 so perhaps that's why I'm not as critical when it comes to reviewing it. As someone who has little time and a lot of stress, this game provided me with an outlet to destress and I loved every minute of it. Sure, the sandbox is gone, but the destruction and carnage are still there. Nothing brought me more joy than bringing down an infected building with cool and creative weapons, or blasting through enemies with badass vehicles. 

As an RF fan, I enjoyed the small touches they placed here and there to build upon the lore. Little things references to the RF history I thought were pretty cool and even how the Terraformer had the EDF symbols on it still were a nice touch. 

Is the game a setback from Guerrilla? Yes, but not a huge one. It's definitely worth a playthrough, at least during a flash sale. It's great, mindless fun and decently long. The enemies, while perhaps a cross between the Flood and Necomorphs, are entertaining to cut down and you learn a good deal about the RF world in the process.",True

I can recommend it, mainly for it´s horror elements and atmosphere, crafted by both well done visual and sound design. However, the game has few flaws that prevented me from finishing the game.

"Don't even bother, theres so many things wrong with how Rust has been recently it's not worth it.

- Toxic Community that the Devs participate in and feed

- Hackers galore with nothing in sight regarding official server moderation

- Current anti-cheat fucked up and had a full wave of false bans

- The grind is not worth it unless you have time to treat this as your second job

- Being in a group is required

- Acts like a survival game but in relaity plays out as an over extended PUBG pvp match

- Instead of focusing on serious issues the developers spend their time on things like boats which noone asked for

TL:DR - Not worth it and an insult to any game that has 'Left Early Access'",False

"I've loved Crysis (1) and I'm having a blast with Crysis 3 right now but this one you can safely pass up. The levels don't have much in the way of detail and feel empty somehow. I think the FOV is off as well. It looks mostly poor (there are some nice views but far and in between). It feels like a console game and the gunplay is weak as well for the most part (weapons feel ""off"", dmg done and taken is too low).

I've finished it since I got it for like 2,99€ or something, but honestly its been more of a chore to finish than I had hoped. Can't recommend.

"A game with much to offer, but so much more it could give...

Don't get me wrong about what I just said. This game is amazing and quite fully functional from my experience so far. Along with a $4 pricetag, not much you can truely have issue with from what is given. It's a very simple RLike/lite, but with a decent loot/stat system. The map is large enough to make it feel like someone put a fair ammount of effort into it, and the enemies have quite a variance to them.

I have to say its worth it if you enjoy fun rpg/rltl

I haven't looked at the discussions, so anything I say past here is just personal wants from the game, that I wish could have been in for 6 dollar higher price.

+First the game looks just fine to me as is, and I quite enjoy the ammount of enemies presented.
-On that point I would like slightly higher vareity in the overworld comparable to what is actually offered
+Second I enjoy the games over world, basic, but very nice to look at...
-which you will be quite often, some more randomization, or Steam Workshop support for modding would be amazing

This is my main point...its quite fun, but I would love to see it have workshop content for tile sets, new items and armor, along with expanded enemies and so on. I feel like it can give this game much more to its potential life, as it lacks randomization. I'm currently on first reset, but from what I've seen it doesnt change the map up at all.


Extended review, Needs work/modding/randomization but its $4 so hey its quite fun for you bucks.",True

"NEVER buy this game, it's unfinished, crappy, unworking, glitchy and they officially stated on the forums that they NEVER will fix it, they abandoned it. So WHY does steam sell this piece of crap when the game is unfinished? What the f**k!

Slightly longer rant:
What a piece of elephant dung. This is the last time I ever buy a game from UBI soft ever. They have done these sorts of stunts before and this was the last straw, go join Electronic Arts in the shame corner. I bought this game on steam because I really loved Silent Hunter 3 (and I’m quite good at it if I might brag). Well, the similarities between Silent Hunter 3 and 5 is they both are games about submarines. And that’s about it. Silent Hunter 5 is a bug infested frustrating random event generator of horror. The graphics are great, sure. When it’s not flickering out of existence, casting opposite shadows randomly when moving the camera around and that sort of stuff. The sound isn’t much better. You move about the ship and somehow they managed to miss the most common bug of ones character making an insane stepdance sound. The lord of the fucking riverdance occuring neatly on a sine curve every minute.

And hey, it’s a submarine game. I know, let’s man the deckgun to shoot down THE HOVERING FUCKING MERCHANTS flying around in the air. Oh, I forgot. I can’t man the deckgun because IT’S BUGGED! What a ripoff. There is no way they missed bugs as these in these numbers. It was an intentional scam. But I must admit some hilarity ensued when my crew hanged around on top of my submarine keeping lookout while I was submerged. Nothing beats that Pirates of the Caribbean feeling. And then it keeps going with integral game mechanics that randomly stops working, stuff disappearing between saves, etc.

To sum it up the state of this game is somewhere in pre-alpha. And hey, UBI soft also installs some hefty DRM for you to make sure you enjoy this experience to the max. Sometimes crackers fixes the bugs for the lols when they crack copy protections. I wonder if they have done the same with this game? Maybe UBI-soft should ask them for help.

I gave up and concluded that surely there must have been some hickup in the patching and went to the official forums to get the latest patch. Lo and behold, UBI soft came out on the forums and officially stated thay they ABANDONED THE GAME. They will never fix it. This game came out in 2010. Why is Steam selling this 2013?

Silent Hunter 4 was also a disappointment but at least it wasn’t so buggy as to be classified as a scam.

My advice to you who wants to play a good submarine simulator. Go get Silent Hunter 3 instead. Install Grey Wolves pack and all the mods. Have realism on max. It’s really good. Enjoy.",True

"I think that this game is amazing, People may think ""Ugh, a lego game it's such a kids thing"" This game is not just suited for kids but is suited to anyone willing to play it. Some of the things that I suggest:
(Local co-op 2 player)
(Personal server hosting also)
A waypoint or compass/map
a home teleport button
building own vehicles
a non monster mode 
a way to delete vehicles
easier ways of placing bricks together

Really enjoyable and if there is something you don`t like or thats missing its not an impossible journey to program it yourself. 

Zomg the inventory is kind of frustrating there are some simple things that are bonkers annoying. Like not being able to q things up you don`t have the resources for so you can see what you need to collect. 

Not being able to fix certain items to certain slots say like stone always goes here.

"I bought this game last year as I was a fan of the original. I enjoyed this remake while it worked (although the game was rather laggy, even though my machine exceeds the recommended specs). However, after a couple of weeks the game wouldn't load any more and the developers haven't responded to support requests (via both their website and the steam forums). Interestingly, they have been responding to forum posts from people wondering whether or not to buy the game.

If the game is on sale you may feel it's worth the risk, but I do recommend you check out the bug/performance reporting forum before you part with your cash. It seems a lot of people have been having problems with this game and I'm not the only one who's not had a response from the devs. I certainly wouldn't recommend you pay full price for this.",False

"Got this game on sale for half and i'm having a love/hate relationship with the game. It's a gorgeous game with really amazing characters and a very interesting story line. As i'm progressing through the game i'm starting to notice how crazy the grind gets. The really cool events early on are becoming tedious. Want to progress ANY story line? Go kill someone/do a conquest/raid a fort and come back. This is repeated over and over and over again and it becomes a bit boring. Leveling doesn't feel rewarding because the enemies scale up and are just damage sponges. You get a few builds where you can cheese but most just feel like hitting a training dummy (atleast on the harder difficulties). Upgrading your gear gets ridiculously expensive (maybe so you'll buy their ""boosts"" from the store?) and it makes playing a certain build very difficult. The in-game store is quite a disappointment as well, i'll admit that I haven't really felt a need to buy anything but the fact that all of that content is there is a real bummer. If you're on the fence and this game isn't on sale I can't really recommend it, but if you're a fan of AC or getting the game for a good deal, it will provide you with a good bit of entertainment.",True
"It's an amazing rogue like game that will take your clock and steal your left over time. It's so addictive when you play with a friend. It's simply wonderful. You can choose your own play style and combo down the bosses. How cares that it's pixelated, the gameplay is the key",True
Is a lot of fun especially if you can get it on sale.,True
"After 600 hours of gameplay I think it is a must to leave a review to the game, which will undoubtedly be positive. If I have to be honest I would never have thought of spending so much time on a game like this, but the hours are what they are and the game really deserves a lot. I think it's one of the best simulators out there. It is very playable, relaxing, beautiful to look at and with a certain philosophy behind it. Skill is not important, patience is the key factor, but nevertheless a minimum of effort is required from the player to do certain things, such as killing a diamond or finally finding a rare one. The fact that i am leaving this review today is no accident. In fact I decided to do it now for a specific reason. I want to leave a rate up to the game before the release of the new patch, where the new scoring system will be released, which I personally think is a bad idea. I don't know if it is for a pure matter of realism or to make the game more family friendly, but in fact denying the player the possibility of failing (removing the quick kill bonus, practically every shot fired will knock down an animal without affecting his score) makes the game ephemeral and useless. I also want to mention the number of diamonds I have killed so far; 207. so that I can remember all the well aimed shots, all the times I have been patient to get in the correct position or to wait for a movement of the animal itself, of all the times that I felt a minimum of emotion in seeing the animal that I had been searching for hours and hours and about anxiety about how to deal with the situation. Eh nothing. I hope it won't be a too devastating update, in a negative way. For sure I will not play in a game where failure is not an option, not as before at least.",True

"1 (Teammate AI)
    A-Horrible basicly useless often fuses togather and sucides to bosses
    B-Unable to use items may or may not use healing spells 

2 (Enemy AI)
    A- Path finding is pretty bad bosses can get confusing easily
    B- some bosses have no path finding only able to use Line attacks (spolier) the church boss where someone dies at has no way of attacking behind it self. eizen was built up earily as this great dragon of enormous power yet he has no path finding and only Line attacks and maybe 1 AOE attack  can just stand on his side of him and spam mikleos arrow attacks.

3 (item Fusion)
    A- could be stream lined a bit better but fuctional 

4 (mikleo)
    A-this characters fusion state is completely broken and unbalanced. you can easily play all the way to the last boss with only this characters fusion. he has infinite range,deals massve damage, stunlocks enemys that are either resistance to him or weak, eizen being one of the big build ups as a fight is unable to do very much if anything to you since the dragon cant turn or focus you even if it could you can always attack out of its range.

5 (Story)
    A- is pretty boring and inconsistent at one point your character kills thousands of people then seemingly forgets and spazs out over killing the final boss. this makes no sense at all he literally kills thousands of people during the war. characters often forget what iris gems do.
    B- Dialog is terrible. try reading it out loud
    C- character development is pretty much no where to be found i cant tell you anything about the characters past.easily the weakest part of the game

Imagine OverWatch with only bronze, silver, then top 100, then the very best player. The game never feels like there is a balanced team, which sucks because other than team balance the game is very fun.

The visuals are absolutely stunning and i havent felt that immersed in a game world for a long time. The world is absolutely beautifull.

For everyone who values immersion and feeling of a game highly i really recommond playing with the minimal UI option. The gameplay holds up very nicley too, it still is a little clunky here and there and i personally would enjoy a free targeting system much more, but it is a great time never the less.

The skills are varied and really add new gameplay possiblties.

"Pros.

Cheap.

Classic-ish megaman style game play.

Good OST.

Cons.

Uses a dash, the dash is ONLY through double tapping left or right and is needed for a good junk of platforming. 

You start with 0 lives (gifted one in tutorial) dying sets you to certain check points, if you use Continue. Rebirth not 100% what it does but it is a life system. Check points are really far apart compared to the amount of instant death traps in the game.

Says it is mapped for controllers. You can only use D-pad for movement (left right, up and down for ladders) So it really isn't full controller support.

Overall. 

Would be a perfect little jump shoot platformer if you could assign dashing to a button.",True

"I am an old school RPG fan. I play games like Beyond the Beyond (which is pretty bad but manageable)  and the old school FFs and I can tell you this remake of an old Sega game is the worst piece of SH*T I have ever played in the RPG genre. The enemies pretty much stay the same though out the whole game, the pacing is crap, the story is uninteresting and the characters are terrible. The interface is clunky at best and you will spend almost all your money buying a few healing herbs from some vendor when each town has multiple vendors all at different prices which doesn't even matter because you will spend all your money anyway.

The game starts out with some promise but after the first town or two you get roped into a mysterious series of events which do not explain much. A drag through the middle of the game will leave you frustrated from long dungeons and uninterested about the points of the story probably because you will forget the reasons you were there in the first place. Seriously one of the most boring and repetitive pieces of garbage to be brought back to life and not worth the time or money. Free would be too expensive for this game simply because it is not worth the time you will put into it.",False

I. LOVE. THIS. GAME.
It got everything you want in a FPS shooter, action, teamwork, vechiels and large maps.

This game is so realistic, you have fun and sometimes its so intense fighting besides your team on the front line, hearing your squad members calling for back up, telling you to push forward.

"Out of all of the Virtual Reality games I've played, Beat Saber is the only standout game for me. I've played your typical shooters, your story games, and not a single game I have in my library of VR titles is as fun to play, as easy to pick up, and as addictive as Beat Saber. However, I'm gonna just start this off by saying a disclaimer.

The only true way to play this game is with mods. I'll just say it right there.

This game is fun on it's own, but the potential this game has in the modding scene for custom beatmaps, custom sabers, avatars, platforms, mods to the game (such as: time scaling, fail-on-miss, multiplayer, and custom track leaderboards) make this game truly the best VR game you can buy right now.

I have never once in my gaming experience come across an Early Access game with this much polish, and this level of ingenuity. Beat saber is one to pick up, guys. I'm serious.

Buy. This. F**king game.

There is back history in Morrowind and Oblivion which I understand come to play in this game.  I made the mistake of starting with Skyrim;  if I ever can stop myself from playing this, I'll go back and play the other two in order before replaying this game.   The capability of  choosing different races and classes makes replaying this game interesting.  Frankly, it might take Elder Scrolls VI to make me put this down.",True
"I'm considering the cost involved in the purchase of this product and whether it is worth it.

I loved the original half-life. It was a life changing game that revolutionised adventure shooters.

Black Mesa on the other hand is a bit of a disappointment. It's a lot of money for a game that neither has its own identity nor produces a significant step forward in any direction. It's fan material at best.

Now that could be enough, but the gameplay is really poor in many areas. It's running on the old half-life 2 engine that is feeling very dated now. A lot of weapons feel odd to use and fire weirdly, and grenades and machine frags do not fire near the crosshair. It's silly and honestly its worse than the original half-life game when it comes to using weaponry. Enemy AI has improved but when only a few Zen monsters spawn, who cares when you're not even going to get hit.

In addition the balance is really bad. When the marines come it is hard and fun, they did a good job on the marines and the AI associated with them is great. But when the marines are out of town and the Zen monsters come in to play, they are pathetically weak, spawn in easy to kill points and do not present a significant threat. Only when a couple of alien grunts show up does it get tricky, but you rarely see them, especially in the final chapter.

Which is another thing, where is Zen? I mean seriously this is an expensive fan made game which is years in development  and they don't have Zen? It's pretty inexcusable really. 

The graphics are great and I love the work they've done on the environments, but the game balance is awful, the lack of new additions is awful, the thing placement is awful and the lack of Zen is the most awful.

It's an old game that doesn't work well on the half-life 2 engine. If they did better balance, had more aggressive and better Zen spawns, I think this could have been a better experience.

Not worth a buy or replay unless you can get on a major sale and prepare for a mediocre experience.",False

The story itself is a bit vague and requires you to think about it to appreciate, this might be attractive to some but not for me. Additionally the game only lasted around 3 hours, and I wouldn't really say I rushed it whjich is much too short for $20.

Overall, I would hardly call it a game perhaps more like a interactive, indie movie. Not worth the $20 in my opinion, don't hope on the hype train and wait for a sale.",False

"First off. I know people are going to read this and go ""You have 1.5k HOURS IN THIS GAME HOW CAN YOU GIVE IT A NEGATIVE REVIEW?""

Easy. I've played the fuck out of this game. I love it. I split the time playing it between myself and a family member. Interacting with dinosaurs? Amazing. Building a base? Amazing. The overall concept of the game? Amazing. 

The difficulty? There are so many times in this game where something stupid happens and it literally has a domino effect on everything else. It's immersive. You take ONE moment for granted while you're mining, or picking some berries and out of NO WHERE you'll get bum rushed by a large dinosaur who's hungry and wants YOU and your TAMED animal for dinner. Within moments the flying mount you've spent HOURS taming can be gone. It's infuriating. You get so mad, and then you go back, and you rebuild. You go find another dinosaur to tame. YOU won't get beat by the game. Even at higher levels it's difficult. It's unforgiving, and for that I appreciate the game itself.

Why can't I recommend this game? It's broken. I've been playing since Alpha and there are STILL snapping issues with buildings. You have structures that have clipping issues and make it difficult building things next to each other. You know minor things that can be fixed relatively easily that have just been overlooked.

Some of the dinosaurs are incredibly unbalanced. MicroRaptors  are hands down the worst thing ever introduced to this game. You literally have no way to combat them and they often come out of no where and are found near numerous other dinosaurs that have no issue taking a nibble out of you and your mount while you're stun locked for 10 seconds. It's hard enough being knocked off of your mount. This is just one of the examples I can give as far as how over powered some of the dinosaurs abilities are.

Constant bugs. This game had NO business exiting early access. I can honestly say that. Every single time you roll out a patch you're breaking something within the game. It doesn't necessarily have to be a large patch like the recent one with aberration. Often times it's small little patches that cripple the game system to the point where it's unplayable. I recall a patch not long ago where anytime you went to harvest stone the game would just hard crash each and ever single time. 

Stuff like this shouldn't be happening to a game that's out of Early Access. 

Quite simply. This game was not ready for a full release. It still is not ready for a full release. You shouldn't have game breaking bugs every single time you release a patch. A proper game that is ready for release is Polished. It functions. This game does not fit either of those criteria. It's understandable to have SOME issues with each major patch, and we appreciate how often Wildcard releases patches and adds things to this game, but this game is still by all means an Early Access title. 

For that reason, and that reason alone. I cannot recommend that others buy this game. Not until Wildcard fixes some of the glaring stability issues that it has.",False
"I love this game!!!!

this game is SO FUN!! i love it",True
"I like lists, people like lists so here goes a list

Cons:

1. Way too short to be worth $11. 
2. The level design is terrible, there is almost no thinking required everything is pretty much straight foward.
3. There are very few game mechanics and not much integration amongst them. 
4. The mechanics are not explored at all, the main game mechanic isnt even used in several levels. 
5.  Its really more of an exploration game than a puzzle game.
6. Its badly programmed, the joystick sensitiviy is so high that the camera moves even when im not moving the joystick. And I have to actually jump over something that should easily be able to walk over.

Pros:

1. Its still fun I would recommend it for younger children to play.
2. I would get it if its for sale.
3. The coop mode is a bit more entertaining because the more the merrier.
4. I have yet to try the vs mode, no idea what that is about, maybe its not so bad.

"Pillars of eternity is one of the best games ive played for a while; it takes everything was great about baldurs gate and icewind dale series and improves on it all.

The companions that join you are equally engaging.  I would have liked the option of being able to recruit some of the unqiue hirelings/prisoners directly into your party as an option.

I enjoyed reading the mini histories of items you find thruout the land and as a plus the inventory management has been greatly improved. There is additionally the campfire and supplies which help you stay out in the field but also be aware you need to resupply after a given point.

Is this a Jojo reference?,True
"""Would you recommend this game to other players?""

Absolutely not.

I've stupidly played longer than ten hours so Steam wouldn't let me refund it even if I tried, but at twenty-seven hours in (27 hours, for those of you who will comment without reading) I'm calling it. This is a bad game. Do not buy it, do not gift it, and if you get it as a gift I'd suggest asking politely if you can get the older, better X3 that has given myself and many others hours upon hours of fun. I didn't play Rebirth because I, apparently correctly, surmised that it was hot garbage, but this? This is an actual X game and it's terrible.

Just read all the other negative reviews, I cannot possibly waste enough time explaining in great detail all the things wrong while covering everything. I just can't. There's so much wrong with this title that it cannot and should not be bothered with. All the ""bugs"" that were supposedly fixed, that I've read about, I'm experiencing years later. For those veterans of the X series the UI and menu spaghetti is still present and I think it might actually be worse now. Features that people talked about early on, like auto-trading, seem to be missing and there's some discussion that it was removed so the crew experience gimmick and grind could get its time in the sun.

There is just so much wrong, over such a long period of time, that searching up the information about whatever you're curious about is futile. You will encounter conflicting information, even from the developers, because it was only relevant back then. There's so much complaining about things that you can't find out about any of it and the tutorials in the game break easily so you can't be taught properly anyway. I have played this series since it started and this game will please no one.

So I'd say do not buy this, even if it's on sale. By the time they ""fix"" this one I think you might be better off just playing something else. I hate to say this about an X game, but even long-time veterans are going to wind up annoyed.

EDIT:
After the 4.0 update I would say that this is fine to buy on sale because, while a lot of the issues I've talked about are still there, the ""menu spaghetti"" is less now.

You can actually order ships to directly do something, like capturing an abandoned ship, that could only have been left up to global orders. AI seem to behave better in squadrons and, while I've never used it, you can issue a ""coordinated attack"" now that I assume mimics the AI dogpiling on you when you're deep in Xenon space or something. Mining is less easy now and you do have to defend your own ships from raiders and I like that, it actually adds some challenge to the game without being an annoying and frustrating experience. However, this is just my own personal experience.",False

"The Stanley Parable: Stanley decided to read this review

The Stanley Parable, first starting as free mod for Half Life 2 in 2011 it gradually grew into full game independent of Half Life 2 by 2013. To say it was a hit with critics would be an understatement, with 9s and 10s across the board as well as winning multiple awards at the BAFTA Games awards and at the NAVGTR Awards for its comedy writing and game innovation.  None of these are invalid to be fair, games that use postmodern commentary on the nature of freedom and choice in games; exploring what the medium can do and criticising the genre of a particular game through satire  (Pony Island, Undertale and DDLC to name a few )have slowly been growing in popularity over the years since the game’s release. The Stanley Parable is more of former then the latter even if there is some great satire to be found.  It is also a short game clocking at 3 to 4 hours even if I do not consider length a way to measure a game’s replayability or quality I know that it can be off putting to some people, especially when money is involvement.  This one is going to be shorter than most of my reviews so let’s get to it!

Stanley is your average office worker, spending all day, everyday pressing buttons on a keyboard in whatever way he was told to do, suddenly one day all his co-workers vanished into thin air; leaving only him to find out what happened to everyone. There is also a narrator who orders you to go to the correct places in the correct order. The game is well written, let’s get that out of the way, the narrator serves both as generic commentator to sinister antagonist to a frustrated programmer depending on what choices you take. Your choices and the freedom to go where ever you want to can result in some interesting changes in the overall story, the game is more of a commentary on the illusion of freedom in game design rather than a full game. That is not to say that it is not worth playing to just watch the game go to strange and wonderful places, the commentary is insightful and intelligent and it does deserve multiple playthoughs, if anything the game needs to be played a number of times considering how short the game is. However the game eventually descends into finding all the endings, there are so many endings that often require very convoluted methods to get that the game soon wore out its welcome. I feel that if the Stanley Parable cut down on some of the more obtuse endings that did not bring much more to the table it would have been more of a complete experience. (These are only my feelings on it and I clearly am in the minority considering what common consensus is.) 

Games like Undertale provided to my mind a more complete experience with a more involving story that was more than just setup for series of situations depending which door you decided to go through. It had more interesting characters who all had motivations independent of the game itself. The narrator could be a totally different character depending on your choices, while that is interesting and  well executed I almost never remembered the narrator as a character but more of what he said, the narrator is a blank slate reacting to the equally blank slate of Stanley rather then there being any independence to it. One might argue that is the point due to the themes but it does not provide memorable character interaction, Sans and Flowery are interesting because of the ways they try to either fight the forth wall or their embrace of it while trying to achieve their goals as well as being highly motivated. Same goes for Monika in DDLC, she has her own motives for doing what she had to rather than just reacting to the player. The narrator has no real motive asides from whatever the game assigns him on the choice you make, it is ambitious and meant taking a risk but to me it does not hit the ground running.  

Gameplay is not much, you walk around with the keyboard and sometimes you can interact with something that is kind of it. However unlike lesser walking Sims the interactive nature of a game is important, it feels great to not obey the narrator and walk through the wrong door, to misbehave is essential to the game’s themes and commentary and I love it. The game messes with how you control enforcing the theme of lack of free will and the illusion of choice, I love it, not really much more to say here.

The game uses Source engine so graphics are rather basic, however the game does look pretty good, the art design itself is rather memorable and distinct. It gives the game a look that is entirely its own as well as being pleasing to see, Beauty in simplicity is the best phase when commenting on this.  

The game runs brilliantly, no flaws at all.

   The Stanley Parable is a good game, please don’t get me wrong. I just feel that it has been surpassed by games that have done more with ideas presented in this game.  The Stanley Parable is well worth a fun Saturday and does deserve to be discussed but if you want something more than please consider getting Undertale or Pony Island instead.",True

Pros---The style of the game screams disney, all the backgrounds and characters are super polished, the gameplay is solid, some nice collectables, fun bosses, and the music and sound effects are great.

Cons---Super easy, pretty short, a few glitches, and a very limited amount of abilities.

When all is said and done this game does what it sets out to do. Everything about it is filled to the brim with that Disney feel and polish. This game is both really easy and short, so don't expect to play this for a challenge. This is a nice game to breeze though and enjoy the experience.",True

"The good:
- funny and well-thought-out story
- great graphics
- fairly easy to get into at first

The bad
- very complex ship building, too many parameters
- bad & clunky ship building interface 
- missing in-depth information
- those bloody icons instead of text in spite of plenty of screen real estate, seemingly just to make matters even harder
- these all compound into a very confusing game, where you simply can't understand what to do with the ship, information on the web is scarce, confusing, sometimes downright wrong.  

I'm on the fence, I'd give it a 'meh' but there's no such rating - so for now, I can't quite recommend it.  I'll try and play a bit more, and dig for info - see if it gets better.

The hardest part this far in the game was the transitioning between level 1 and 2. It was like the whole ""movement""-system completly changed.

"This game is more or less a shot-for-shot remake of the old Impressions City-Building Series (Caesar, Pharaoh, etc.), but set in the Wild West.

Which is good in theory, but there are a lot of good reasons that gaming's evolved past this since the last of those games came out in the early aughts. Resource management is a nightmare, houses will downgrade all the way from big mansions to little shacks because you had a temporary timber or alcohol shortage, non-renewable resources run out practically instantly, there are no options to automate the trade system to keep from running out of key import resources (or sell your resources you've set to export)...every place the designer had a decision to make about game flow, they made the wrong one.

Basically, this game would've been very good in 1999, but it's not 1999 anymore and there's no excuse for this kind of design even in a casual game.  I wanted to like it, but it simply isn't very good. More frustrating than fun even for big fans of the genre.",False

"Not sure what all the hype is about. Within the first ten minutes of playing, it became clear that this was not going to be fun at all. Everything is so incredibly complicated, and even with the new tutorial, none of my questions were answered. Generally speaking, I love survival, base-building, crafting, and open world games. But Astroneer seems to do all of these reeeeally poorly. From the second you start, you have no idea what you're supposed to be doing or how you're supposed to do it. Had to use the wiki within 15 minutes of playing because it's unclear what anything you find or make is used for. Even checking the wiki just seemed to make things even less clear. Add to that that the controls are laughably terrible and the UI and camera control are a convoluted mess, not to mention a nuissance, and the game goes from complex to just garbage. Wanted to like it, couldn't. Refunded.",False

"This is one of my favorite wave-attack type games out there! The quality is absolutely fantastic; the game looks and runs beautifully. There's lots of great and fun weapons, perks, and classes to choose from and experiment with.

This is one of those games where you can just kick back, relax, and utterly wreck some disgusting creatures in beautiful gorey spectacle. I highly recommend it to any shooter fans and those wanting a coop experience that isn't PVP.

Pros:
+ Fun as hell. Fantastic gunplay.
+ Looks amazing, well optimized.
+ Loads of content.
+ Community support.

Cons:
- Microtransactions.
- Sprinting still feels slow and kinda useless.
- Movement abilities limited to crouch, sprint, and hop. Can't really vault or traverse the environment well.",True

Trading cards
Soundtrack is nice

Cons:

-You hear dubstep CONSTANTLY in the game (ALL the music in the soundtrack has dubstep as the genre) unless it's for some reason not playing in a level (Could be a pro if you REALLY like dubstep)
-There's a lot of glitches
-There is NO air strafing at all (If you jump and want to turn in mid air you cannot do it at ALL, even on big jumps)
-You have to watch a stupid death animation for like 7 seconds before you can skip it and you are sent to the level select screen instead of just restarting the level
-The game is pretty short but beating it takes a couple hours cause the game is such a pain in the ass

I beat the game and I'm never touching it again.",False

Then please stop searching, Steam doesn't provide this kind of nudity. If you're new to these kind of games, I would recommend Sakura Spirit. It's slow progressing and fun to play/read. It's a great game for people who have never played these type of games. I hope Steam will be providing us with even more visual novels in the future.",True
"9/10
Perhaps the best co-op multiplayer, where every member relies on each other yet is integral to how smooth the heist goes.
Loads of player-created maps, as well as enhanced and zombie mode for every flavor of the game
It's simple. Simpe and effective, with how you get and use items, yet each little nuance refines your skills.
Loads of fun to speed run or be super stealthy

Negatives? A few times playing online the whole floor map appears and locks me in, so I had to make or find a new room to play. When everyone spreads out things can get reaally small, while already detailed--but to each their own, this is little problem to me. I'd recommend this game to anyone",True

"Having played every Assassin's Creed game (not the mobile games) in the franchise, I wanted to write a review for Origins.

My Rig:
Processor: i5-4670k CPU @ 3.40GHz
RAM: 16 GB
OS: Windows 10 64-bit
GPU: NVIDIA Gigabite GeForce GTX 1070 G1 Gaming 8GB

Performance

I was worried when I heard that AC:O would have the same system specs as Syndicate, as my PC and Syndicate did not have be best relationship.  The game ran fine, but the optimization was poor.  However, I can safely say that the extra year they spent in development did them all kinds of favors.  AC:O runs incredibly smooth on my machine with everything tuned up to High.  I don't see a terribly huge difference between High and Very High, so I went with High to add to the Performace over Quality.  I have yet to encounter a single bug, glitch or crash.

Gameplay

Wow.  Just, wow.  I think AC:O may be the Black Flag Dev Team's way of tea-bagging the rest of Ubisoft and claiming their supremacy.  It's an incredible game thus far.  Combat is very ""souls-like"" with a large array of different weapon types, and therefore ways to approach a challenge.  I've so far counted four separate bow styles that each bring something different to the table (precision, speed, etc).  Everything is very fluid, and feels natural.  It's possible to call your mount while in combat and transition from fighting face to face, to firing arrows while sitting backwards on a galloping horse.

Story

Story is harder to write about as I've only had eight hours of gameplay at the time of writing this, but also because I believe people look for different things, and are drawn to different stories.  That said, I'll let you form your own opinion.

TL:DR

AC:O may very well be the heir apparent to the title of ""Best Assassin's Creed Game"".  I highly recommend it.  Try it for a couple hours, and if you don't like it you can return it.",True

"To start, coming into this I thought this was going to be just a revamped version of the Sega Genesis Shadowrun title. Keep that in mind if you have not played the Sega Genesis version because this review and my feelings concerning this installment are based on comparisons between the two games. But here are the reasons why I think this new PC version is WAY worse than  
it's console predecessor:


1. The word ""linear"" begins in no way to describe the disgustingly linear nature of this game. You don't really get any side jobs from Johnsons, there are two open areas in the whole game instead of the 4 or 5 from the Genesis tiltle. Furthermore there are no shops, gang hideouts, corporate buildings or abandoned buildings where the supernatural baddies were found in the Sega version. In the latter version you were able to endlessly grind by doing any matter of small job like courier work, matrix runs, larceny and even ones where you'd get paid to go into abandoned buildings and get paid a flat rate per ghoul head you come back with. NONE of that awesome content that made that game more appealing.

2. No random encounters. All the battles are staged and preset. In the Sega game if you get a run to steal something from a corporate HQ you could employ stealth, deck into the matrix while in the building to glean info on the location of your target.  
If you didn't trip alarms you could go in the building and come back out without anyone being the wiser. None of that in this new game. Every encounter is scripted with the same number of enemies everytime. You cannot grind levels at all in this game and pretty much have to pick 2 skills to excel at or have a mundane ""Jack of All Trades"" character who is OK at everything but good or great at nothing. The original plot from the Genesis version was very twisty and turny giving the illusion that there were side storylines going on but there really weren't. 

3. Alot of reviews I read about this game really tout the writing of this storyline. I say to these people ""Read the story from the Genesis version"". It was awesome. It spans four different ""suburbs"" of Seattle. There are WAY more players in the plot as far as NPC's, everyone has their finger in this pie as far as NPC organizations including all three major corporations, Lonestar, and even a local tribe of native americans, the plot actually climaxes in a tribal land environment which, if memory serves was a 5th open area location you could navigate. There are 2 open areas in this new game with no open doors into other locations other than the cantina where ALL of your vendors, johnsons, and NPC quest givers reside. Main quest NPCs, Johnsons, and Vendors were all scattered over the 4 city locations in the game along with all the different corporate HQ buildings, Lonestar HQ, a prison facility, hotels to rest up and heal. The list never ends.

4. Shadowrunners in this new game are only available for hire when you are anticipating a run. In the Sega version you could hire anyone that you had the cash to hire AND you could opt to hire them just for one job OR until they die. The price to hire a shadowrunner who died on a previous ""botched run"" will charge you more money if you desire their services again. It was MUCH better. I will say that the newer game has a better selection of shadowrunners though as the original game had characters already at certain high scale clubs or down and dirty dive bars situated in the 4 urban locations of the game. But only being able to use shadowrunners while you're on main story missions is lame. Your not actually going on shadowruns at all. You're on a quest following leads that you are prompted to find. 

5. I beat this game in like 4 or 5 hours total gameplay. I am glad I got this game at a discount and I will not be buying the DLC. 

There is one more thing I did like better about this version, though it is not a saving grace by any means. You can create your own character from any race you want and there is a much wider variety of character classes to choose from. In the first game you could only be human because the character whose murder you are solving was your brother, your brother was human. Lame. In this one the person whose murder you are solving was your good friend and long time partner in running the shadows so you can be any race you want for that reason. That was a sizeable improvement but not a good trade off for the free roaming you could do in the first game. Also, there is more strategy needed in the battles you have in the new game. If you choose a Decker you better hire some big orc or troll samurais or adepts to absorb bullets for you or frustration may get the better of you. I abandoned my original elf decker build for a troll samurai because of how badly I was getting squished (on Easy difficulty).

Not the worst game I spent $15 on but it definitely inhabits the bottom of the barrel with the worst of 'em.",False

"A refreshingly funny and well-written comedy adventure trilogy, with top notch voice acting, surprisingly good and super-stylized cel-shaded graphics and an entertainingly charming(albeit sometimes a bit confusing in its mythology) neo noir-meets-african-folklore-story. The final part might be a bit too easy, puzzle wise, and flew by very quickly, but as a whole, TJD succeds in doing something new and funny in the otherwise rather stale, unfunny and derivate genre of comedy adventure games.",True

"Bought this remaster 50% off mainly because I wanted non-fluctuating 60 FPS (the original had drastic FPS drops in certain areas and from particle effects), improved lighting and textures, and working multiplayer. Wasn't dissapointed. I got what I payed for, even though they really could have done much more with remastering the game. Selling this remaster for a full price of $40 is pretty ridiculous, considering how minimal many of the improvements actually are, and that the game is now 8 years old. Even $20 for PTDE owners is still too much when you look at the god-awful port they gave PC users which they never fixed or updated for 6 years, not to mention it needed community-made mods in order to even function properly, multiplayer and gameplay-wise. They could've at least compensated for their terrible PC port with a lower discount, as you're literally-paying the same price of PTDE for the same game with all the things PTDE should have had in the first place. Oh well. We get what we get. If you're willing to pay $20 or $40 for revived and working multiplayer, stable FPS, better lighting, a few convenient new features, semi-improved textures, etc., go for it. If you think this remaster is a huge cashgrab and would rather stick with PTDE using DSfix and Wulf's connectivity mod, don't buy it.",True

"An absolute disappointment. I regret this purchase.

Update: 

I was requested to provide a rationale - so here it goes:

1. The forced humor of this game reminds me of crap comics where background laughter augments stupid jokes so that stupid people may laugh for a passable farting moment;
2. While Borderlands 1 was a novelty in itself (a solid game), Borderlands 2 feel more of the same thing - just worse. Worse story, worse progression, worse jokes. At least in Borderlands 1 there was some subtlety in the jokes;
3. This game feels like a freak show. In Borderlands 1 the advancement seemed meaningful most of the time - feels like there is a story behind and an objective that gradually emerges along. This game feels like some junior grade writer put together as much crap as it could because the brand sells. Yea - fuck you.
4. Copy paste and pasta again boyz - because it has to be big. Copy crap, paste crap and re-colorize it. The masses will exult. Yea - fuck you too.
5. The last and the most important: take meaningful ideas, hopes and principle and just twist them for no reason because WE WANT FUCKING FILLER CONTENT - FUCK THE CONSUMER. Take Bible verses and twist them, take great saying and twist them - because mocking is cool and our players are dumb fucks. Did is I say fuck you again? Gearbox? Yea - by now you've got the drill.

All in all - I deleted the game from my account. No refund. I consider the money I spent as medicine for my own stupidity. Healthcare is not free.

Hint: don't buy this game. Don't buy from these guys. Ever.",False
"Do you like to drive IRL?  If so, check this game out.  Easy to play with a gamepad, sublime with a wheel and shifter.  It feels like driving--the visuals are great, and if you set the physics to realistic, you'll feel like you're really driving a heavy truck.

Workshop is excellent for the game, but as the game has matured, I'm using less and less of them.  SCS has been adding states to the game since launch as DLC, and about every six months releases quality of life changes and new fun features.

The economic sim is relatively simple, but you can buy trucks, trailers and garages, and hire drivers to run your other trucks and trailers.  There are good economy mods to be had in the workshop if you want a tougher challenge.

It's also much like warfare--a lot of relaxing moments of just cruising along, and then suddenly you see the flash of brake lights and you realize your 120klbs truck and trailer might not stop in time this time....   Or you enabled real physics and decided to take that turn over the recommended speed....as you watch your load rotate in your side mirror and then take you with it.

For what it is, it's a gem.  If you just like the open road and playing tunes, this is your version of fishing.  Embrace it!",True
"What a masterpiece! It took me 80 hours to complete the game! Never was so happy and sad at the same time when seeing the credits. 
At first, when the game launched I thought that this type/genre of game would not be the type I would really like (mainly because of the fights). But after playing it for the first hours, I realised how much I loved the gameplay. Almost everything can be interacted with, the conversations are a absolutely awesome, it definitely feels like an RPG where only imagination is the limit. 
Would definitely buy it again.
And I'm looking forward for Baldur's gate!",True
"Works great for me on Windows 10, with all DLC.  I loved the game on Xbox 360, but it only had the 1910 and Europe editions, and no discounts on DLC.  Steam has all the DLC, and the package price was good.  I was hesitant to at first because of all the negative reviews about the cross-platform consistent interface, crashes, and DLC recognition issues.  But I gave in and bought the base game first, and it worked great (on my Alienware Alpha with Windows 10).  Then I bought the complete DLC pack, which installed on its own, and was recognized just fine when I checked.  The shop doesn't offer to sell me them, and they all can be selected and will allow the button to say ""Play"".

The new interface works good for me (on my 47"" TV).  I was very used to the Xbox 360 version, which I am guessing was the same as the old interface people refer to on Steam.  But I did find the interface to work well, intuitively, and more quickly.  Anyone who knows how to play should be just fine.  In fact, the play flows faster than the Xbox 360 version, which was a surprise to me because I expected the worst after all the negative comments about the new UI.  The text might be a little small in some cases if viewing on a small screen, but it is the same on tablets and is perfectly fine on a large TV.  The words don't really matter anyway, you can get the gist from the large graphics and colors.

I only wish it had controller support.  The mouse works fine and intuitively.  I had just expected it to work with a controller like the Xbox 360 version.  It would be easier for multiple local players if each have their own controller (like the 360).  But it works just fine.  I ended up getting a 2nd copy for someone else to play with me via Online, and that solved that problem :) .",True

"**I RECOMMEND ONLY WHEN ITS ONY 50% OR HIGHER SALE**

Its fun.. But certainly not worth $20.00!  If, like me, you can get it on sale, its worth a shot..I like pause n play tactics.. The heros dont reflect any gear you may obtain, to there appearance, but they only allow for jewlry slots (5 i think)..  But there is forking upgrade paths for each heroes 4 abilities.. 1 path at first, then after 2-3 upgrades, you choose 1 of 2 directions, effectively altering how the ability works, or strengthening it... It does look ok, but nothing thats gonna turn heads.. It does have some CTD issues occasionally..Its extremely linear, and enemies do not respawn, so theres no famring, and i havent felt ""OP"" at any point.. Granted i havent finished it.. There are certainly better titles out there, but i think i only payed a few bucks for it, so.. it was worth it for 5-10 dollars..

Some of the battles dont allow for many ways to tackle them, until later on, when you start getting multiple teammates.. You can have up to 4 in you party.. Youve got your tanks, healers, ranged, and melee dps, Controllers (improtant), etc.. Much of the combat is absolutely necessary to utilize the pause-n-play feature...

"What a great little game. 

You play against 3 AI oil tycoons. The aim is to make money and eventually become the Mayor of the town. The game is split into two phases. 

The town phase sees you purchase and upgrade your equipment, sell diamonds, gain advantages by talking with saloon patrons, buy shares and select the next parcel of land to drill on. 

The mining phase has you explore your land and drill for oil, gas and rare diamonds. You can do this in several different ways. Using humans, animal, electronics or even pot luck. As you collect oil you either need to store it or sell to one of two companies. This phase lasts between 3-12 months (usually 12) and you must sell your oil before the end of the phase.  Each block of land is random so finding the oil is different each time. 

There are quite a few different upgrades that cater to whatever play style you choose. 

Well worth it.",True

I began playing using my mouse and keyboard, and it was rage-quit-ly impossible. The experience was far better with a controller, though the game still suffers from significant control issues, especially where precision is required. More frequent save points are also in order, as solving 85% of a run over and over again becomes tedious and boring quite quickly.

Despite these issues, I warmly recommend the game. The art is stunning, the narrative is compelling, and the mystery is right up my alley. Overall, the game was enjoyable enough to lure me into playing it again for completing its achievements, and I'm very likely to buy its expansions as well. If you enjoyed Limbo and Inside by Playdead - don't miss Little Nightmares.",True
amazing game! very fun competetive mode with friend very recomaded,True
"The atmosphere reminded me a lot of Bioshock, due to the isolated feeling of Talos I.
The story is pretty straightforward, but there are multiple endings and various side-quests to extend the playtime. (The ending got me shook) There is a vast map to explore (not vast by open world game standards, but still pretty big) and you can even go into outer space to collect dead bodies and do missions. You can also unlock skills with Neuromods, which are basically like ADAM from Bioshock. Your main enemies are the Typhon, which are alien-like tentacle monsters that look like they came straight out of an episode of a certain off-brand anime. There are different types of Typhon, each with different weaknesses and powers. You can unlock the ability to unlock new skills (neuromods are still required for unlocks) by scanning new Typhon, and you can get different powers based on the Typhon as well.
Ammo management is incredibly important early on in the game, but after you are introduced to fabricators and collecting fabrication plans, you can pretty much make anything you need, as long as you have the resources.

"Initial impressions:
+ The tennis feels good and you have a decent amount of control.
+ I'm not sold on most of the movement options, but nice to know they are there if I get used to them. 
+ The package as a whole is nicely put together, with little touches like a virtual locker room well done.

But

+/- The game seems somewhat buggy. I don't know how they think tennis scoring works, but it isn't how it is implemented. Further I have had the game complete fail to progress after points when up at the net. 
Update: This was fixed more or less overnight, so leaving it in the remove to show things get fixed.

- The sound/commentary is pretty bad and almost always fails to match the action. For example little tennis things are wrong like if you serve into the net, the umpire does not call ""fault""
- The game in general, but especially in practice is too sluggish between points. You have to wait just a few seconds too long before everything ""resets"" and you can get to the same point. I found myself pressing the button to get the ball in my hand to server... oh not yet, didn't work. How about now? Nope, still does nothing... now? Nooooo, ok now the button worked and I can serve. You need someway to get straight back into the action.

Is it there yet? No I don't quite think so. It still needs a few more versions and a lot of polish. But I'd say it will get there, so worth supporting.",True

"The Quick Review, 

If you're looking for the old Civ, then you've come to the wrong place. But wait, this place is still great to be in if you're a Civ fan. 

The game makes some natural improvements that need to be made. It introduces a district system which houses various buildings related to that district, (Universities and libraries in the science district for example). You'll place them on the map, and strategically build your cities accordingly. Say for instance you have a city close to mountains, if you put a science district close by the mountains give extra science bonus to that district. 

Why did I bother explaining that? Because its a great concept that establishes each city as a unique place that has the potential to operate differently than your other cities. For example City X is my trade city, and I focus on trade buildings there, and City Y has an encampment so I build troops there. So on and so forth. 

The expansions, gathering storm in particular are for sure worth the buy and adds awesome new mechanics to the game, that should be annoying on paper but offer great strategic choices, and actually adds value to obtaining strategic resources. A very very welcome change. 

I highly recommend this game.

9/10 (10/10 with gathering storm)",True

"Great game, very detailed and the music is pretty catchy and has a nice beat to it! 
Pros: Game is VERY detailed, from engine type all the way to the screws and push rods that you can (and sometimes have to) replace for the engine to work again.
Dynamo, paint room, main shop and other assorted rooms and tools for testing vehicles to check for problems.
Main workshop has 6 car spots (once fully upgraded) and there are several car garage levels that you can use to store finished or future restoration projects.
There is no better satisfying feeling than watching all the rust from an old banged up car disappear when you fix it.
You can switch radio stations which all have several sound tracks that will take you awhile to listen to all the music.
The variety of vehicles is awesome! And the ability to use mods with this game makes it even better.


Cons: not nearly enough interior customization (you can only change seats and steering wheel.) I wish they had more options for decals and designs on your vehicle.
You can't repair some parts (i get that in real life you can't fix something that's almost completely broken, but the stupid and annoying thing in this game is that you can take the exact same part off a car, one will be 92% damaged and the other will only be 49% damaged, but it will sometimes only let me repair the 92% damaged and act like the 49% damaged part doesn't even exist when I go to the workbench to repair parts.)
There's only one engine repair stand (you would think that once you've fully upgraded your workshop to Where you have 3 car lifts and 3 waiting spots that they would give you a second engine block repair stand, but you only get one, having at least two would make repairs and orders go a lot faster in my opinion.)

Overall though, it's a great game and would definitely recommend this to a friend.
Despite all the cons I still give this game a 9/10
The only thing that would make this game better is if they added more interior and paint/design customization, if they put in a second engine block repair stand and if they let you have a chance to repair all items instead of playing Russian roulette with which items you're able to repair.",True

"Game is buggy as hell, classic Bathesda. Wait for modders to fix it before buying.

Edit: Just to give slightly more depth to the review - the game is playable and I've been able to work around the bugs that I've found. I will also say that I don't like the direction they took with the game that much. They've removed a lot of the RPG aspects from it and focused more on the shooter aspect. That's not bad, it's still a fun game, but it's more of a post apocalyptic Farcry than it is a Fallout game. If that sounds good to you, you should buy the game. I'm going to leave my review on negative as a way of communicating to the company that I don't prefer what they've done with it.",False

"Bought into this game when Sony first acquired the IP.  Was super stoked to have something that looked. felt, AND PLAYED better than DayZ.  Unfortunately when they decided to go all Battle Royale they decided to pretty much ignore the rest of the community to do the instant gratification side of the game.  Maybe there's more money to be made off of those kids, who knows?  But by deciding that BR was more important than the original game that made me start looking at other games.  And guess what happened as a result of that?  I found RUST, I found a gang of crazy Aussies to play with [TGB] and I had hours upon hours of fun time with them and in a game that wasn't being ignored for a smaller aspect of the game in itself.  Did I get my money's worth for this game?........yeah?  Would I reccomend it to anyone else??  If it's F2P I guess there's no harm in downloading it.  But for all the effort their putting into it it's a house that they started to build a long time ago on a cliff next to a beach, so it's only a matter of time.  It was fun, but it's been deleted since I haven't clicked on the icon in a matter of years.  Good Luck Daybreak.",False

"What can I say, a truly excellent game. Each campaign is spectacular. I played through all 3 campaigns so far (Shovel, Plague and Spector Knights - the King Knight campaign has not yet been released). I started with the Shovel Knight campaign and it was awesome. Great controls, fun to bounce on enemies and the best one to start off with because it lets you know the basics in terms of story, gameplay, level design, etc. I then did the Plague Knight campaign. I was a little worried because some reviews said that controlling the platforming with his use of bombs and burst jumping would be difficult, but I actually found it quite enjoyable. In fact, at the end of the Plague knight campaign I have to say that I had more fun with that campaign, than I did with the Shovel knight campaign (which I wont lie, I loved a lot as well). The platforming with the burst jump isn't as bad as other people might make it out to be. Plus, you can destroy the bosses a lot quicker with bombs than you can with Shovel Knight's repeated bouncing. Last, but certainly my favourite, was the Spector Knight campaign. It felt awesome to slice and dash jump you way around the screen as the Spector Knight. It also had variations in the levels which was a nice change because the first two campaigns (Shovel and Plague) are essentially the same levels, just different mechanics in order to get through the levels. The only thing about the Spector Knight campaign is that it is shorter (about 1/2 the length of the other two campaigns). In the end, an absolutely fantastic game, great controls, awesome platforming, challenging bosses, awesome pixel art and music. There really are no weaknesses that I can see. I can't wait for the last campaign - King of Cards featuring King Knight, it should be EPIC!!!!",True

Really great game for lgbt,True
"I have only played a little so far. Here are my first impressions on this.

1. If you are a console player then you can play this. The game was made for PS4 and by the behavior of the code it was simply imported to PC with no optimization for the PC system. Being that Steam accounts are widely used for PC playing this game is not a wise choice.

2. It is similar to splinter cell where diversions and sneaks have to be implemented in order to succeed. This is not Gears of War or Mass Effect style, which is what I was hoping for. 

3. The graphics on ultra with my 1070 ti continuously produces ~30 FPS when looking at flames or field depth. VSYNC and other settings have no change on this performance until Low or Medium graphics are used. 

4. Controls are good. Simple and easy to use with a variety of maneuvers.

5. Weapons and items are various and specific. Early on you can find a crowbar for melee attacks. I killed a lone solider with no gun fire made. Which was nice, down side it alerts all combatants in the area, even on the other side of a cement wall. Melee kills are not silent ones apparently.

6.  AI awareness and player awareness. As I earlier stated this game is more Splinter Cell then Gears of War. The AI can see and hear the player pretty well on standard difficulty. The player can maneuver with ease between covers and run or crouch a good distance away from NPCs before risking detection. -- That being said, when I threw an empty can to distract a soldier my player can clearly hear the can make plenty of noise. But the soldier, who was on the other side of my cover, made no attempt to investigate. 

Overall, this is a Console Game in a PC world. Being that Steam is mostly PC players, I can not support this game. Although I might just play it because of my intrigue for the story and comparison to Square Equinox's Final Fantasy's. (Will update my review as I play.)",False
"So this game is a lot of fun. Soundtrack is amazing and one of the best i've heard in a video game for a while now. It's short and had limited replayability but that is understandable for the price.

"Meh, constantly out of food. Cant ever seem to get ahead. Every enemy has a gun, and I still haven't been lucky enough to randomly scavange the right pieces to make one. Even if you do feel like you're finally ahead on something you're severly lacking in other areas. For example I finally saved up enough food for 2-3 days, but then had no weapons and lost most of my food and water from raids because I didn't have weapons. Putting someone on guard is pointless, I seriously did it 8 nights in a row and got robbed on 6 of them lol. Starting back pack with 10 spaces is entirely too small. I guess maybe if you were a single scavenger for yourself, but you're forced onto a 3 man team.  And WHY CAN I CARRY 10 BOTTLES OF WATER IN A SINGLE BACK PACK SLOT, BUT ONLY 2 STICKS IN THE SAME AMOUNT OF SPACE. Just doesnt add up. Also why wouldn't each scavenger be able to go on their own solo mission at night time. Or let me send 2 out and one has to stay or something. I can force them to sleep on the floor instead of a bed, but not to go on a mission if some one else is also out and about. Just seems lame. I mean especially since when i put a guy on guard duty and it says we get robbed anyways... like why the fuck couldn't he have just been out scavenging. At least then after getting robbed I come back with some items.",False

"For most this might be a weird review, so I'll do a quick TLDR to start. I'm not a big fan of the game, but for the sci-fi / space/ city builder fans out there its worth a pickup while on sale

For me, I personally ran out of steam for the game rather fast. While I do feel that the game is well polished and nice looking, it felt like it was lacking in something. I think the fault I have is that I'm comparing it too much with other city builders like Cities Skylines which have a far wider diversity of features and options. Though with that said, for its standing price tag, I feel like it should have offered more.

A good example is that the resource tree is rather frustrating, and that is my biggest complaint. While in games like Banished where your always in a fight to keep your resources in balance (often having to boost one right after having boosted the other) Aven Colony simply has a chronic lack of power and/or building materials. Given that this is the only struggle to really combat, that never seems to go away regardless of colony size, it rather depletes the game quality. While there is a number of food production options, they feel quite redundant and serve no benifit to have so many other than to go Pokemon and ""gotta get them all""

So why do I recomend it? Its still a good space simulation game. By no means do I feel its broken, and I do belive that many would enjoy it for other reasons. It does have a good number of campaigns (to I admit I did not try, but that was not what I wanted to play, I'm more of a sandbox player) for example. The map sizes are also welcoming so one could build quite a large colony if they so choose. Plus the game still does have a challenge to it to the perfectionists out there.

In all, I don't see myself making it the timesink that I wanted it to be but ultimatly I feel that it would be wrong to give it a ""no"" just because the game didn't line up with exactly what I wanted in it.",True

Poorly, if at all syncing between voices and character's speaking in cutscenes, little to no polish on interactions between NPCs a/o objects (noticable gap of several inches between objact and NPC's hand) as well as watching NPCs walk through each other on several occasions. There also seems to eb missing textures as well.",False

"I really enjoyed the first game and was looking forward to this one. I've enjoy this one even more than the first. Everything has been improved upon. From the graphics to the mechanics to the sound design and the matchmaking process. For those of you who are not farmiliar with the Vermintide series, it plays much like Left 4 Dead. Whats mainly different is the setting of the game. 

  Vermintide 2 is a co-op 4 player online game set in the Warhammer Fantasy universe during The End Times. Warhammer Fantasy is a grim-dark high fantasy setting (similar to J.R.R Tolkien's Middle Earth) created by Games Workshop. It was originally a tabletop miniature game that has now been adapted to many differnt forms of media. Much like left for dead this is an apocalyptic setting. Instead of zombies however there are hordes of ratmen and plague ridden worshipers of Nurgle; the plaguefather, a dark god whose machinations look to turn the world into a disease infested pool of goo. You fight through these hordes in linear maps - somewhat smaller than those in Left 4 Dead - looking to complete different objectives on each. Supplies and collectables can be found throughout these maps. The collectables help you get a better chance at more powerful loot once the level is complete.

  Something else thats different in this game is that it has RPG elements, like characters and equipment. There are five different characters each with their own unique set of weapons and abilities. The characters are: Bardin Goreksson - a hardy Dwarf master ranger, with a taste for alcohol; Kerillian - a Wood Elf waystalker, whose arrogance matches her skill with both bow and blade; Marcus Kruber - Veteran Sergant of The Empire of Man turned hired blade (sweet hat bro); Sienna Fuegonasus - an immensly powerful Bright Wizard with an addiction for the fire she unleashes; and Victor Saltzpyre - Witch Hunter Captian of The Grand Theogonists of The Empire of Man and devout follower of Sigmar ([b] SIGMAR BLESS THIS RAVAGED BODY! [/b]). Like Left 4 Dead there are only 4 player per session so its very likely your favorite character will be available in pick up groups.

  Something new to the sequel is career paths, talents and abilities(as well as the Rotblood Tribe - the plague ridden followers of Nurgle(PRAISE FATHER PLAGUE)). Each character has three career paths allowing you to further customize your play style. The generic way i see them are: Ranged specialist, Tank/Support, and DPS/Assassin. The only one missing this archytype style is the Bright Wizard. The characters sharing these archetypes does not mean that they feel the same however. Each feels and plays much differently thanks to the way the devs have designed the weapons they use and the talent trees that are specific to each character and their career paths. Each career path has a unique passive ability and active ability that gives them both flavor and a place amongst the team.

  Even with the RPG elements this game is heavily skill based. Each melee weapon has a unique animation cylce that effects its performance with both light attacks (left click) and heavy attacks (hold left click). You may also block, shove, dodge and counter attack - again unique to the weapon. Most Ranged weapons have a hip fire style and an aim style. With weapons like the bows aiming is more powerful while hip firing is faster, some weapons are unique and have an alternate fire or simply a shove. The Bright wizard has the most diverse roster of ranged weapons as these act like her spells. Positioning in the map is key and knowing your enemies is your biggest strength. 

  Each character has access to a melee weapon, ranged weapon(except the dwarf's slayer career he gets a second melee), trinket, charm and necklace. The three non combat items you get serve to boost your combat stats in some way or another. The game also has a loot and rarity system. White gear being the lowest tier, Green being better than that, Blue even better, Orange even better still and Red being the best you can get. All weapons can be customized at the forge before play to suit your playstyle and preference.

  Similar to Left 4 Dead there are different kinds of special enimies with unique mechanics as well as heavy enemies and a (newly)diverse roster of mini-bosses and bosses. Each enemy has a different armor class that varies for different parts of their body. The more armored they are the harder you will have to try to pierce their armor lacking a naturaly armor-piercing weapon(like an axe). Another new addition is shielded enemies, who you either need to hit from behind(easier said then done), deplete their stamina with a few hits or break their shield with a shield breaking weapon(axes op). Enimies are usually scattered through the map in different patterens and compositions each run. With hordes, specials, heavy patrols and mini-bosses assailing the players throughout the game. Hordes and specials come every so often(hurry through), as well as at triggered events while mini-bosses will come at random times but only a limited number of times and at triggered events; while bosses are in certain levels.

  The graphics in this game are quite good, not the greatist - but im not a fan of games that sacrafice gamplay in the name of [i] cough [/i] art. Framerates are very good and my non-high-end pc runs it at about 60-70fps on medium quality(still looks great). You can change every key bind in the game to what you want (seriously this is something in short supply these days for some reason). Sound design is one of the best I've ever heard and if you want to play at a high level headphones are a must as you can hear the enimies [spoiler] shit [/spoiler] themselves as they dare to strike at you. Seriously tho it helps you identify where certain types of enimies are and who they are (+ sweet ambiance). I do wish they let you tweak with the sound a little more but its not lacking too much.

  This game is quite difficult and not for the faint of heart. The difficulty however gives it a high skill ceilling and a lot of replayability. So if you are up for a challenge, this game is for you. There are 4 difficulty levels with Recruit being the first and easiest that you have to play for a bit to upgrade your gear to qualify for the next difficulty. Veteran is the next level and here the enemies do much more damage and can take more as well as being more aggresive to boot. At a certain gear level you unlock Champion Difficulty where friendly fire(ranged and bombs) is enabled, enemies become even more unforgiving. Lord is the most difficult and is unforgiving and unlocked at a high gear level. Don't get hit.

All in all 10/10 would [strike] slay rats [/strike] get murdered by rats again.",True

And the 2D/3D are all good and have a nice touch for the lovers of the visual.This is certainly the best zombie survival game outhere.

I firmly disagree with the players complaining about NPCs and graphics. They don't understand that to make such lvl of A.I, they would have to waste the entire team's force to make something usefull and it won't be effective because not all the developers crew are A.I programmers. So, instead, they preferred to complete the entire body of the game and even projected a multiplayer for it as a way to compensate us, the MP wasn't even planned.

"I think this game deserves a much higher rating.

First of all, yes, there are some issues with fps drops, but i managed to tweak settings and now i have stable 60 fps. U can find my guide, i shared my config there.

Now about design. It is the most colorful, fast and, well, casual space simulator i played. In comparison to Elite, it is much easier but much-much more interesting. There are a lot of things u can do: explore ancient ruins, try to learn alien languages and pass some checks when u encounter different aliens, scan flora and fauna, farm for resources and upgrade your weapon/suit/ship, trade with different species, attack freighters or fight against pirates. And yes, there is a lore behind all these, but u have to explore the game on your own. There are no typical quests, but u will always have a few goals to achieve.

Just keep in mind: u have to pass a few hours to beat the tutorial sequence of the game (it was about three star systems for me) but then u have a pretty clear choice. I will not spoil the solution devs used but i understood from one moment that if i want more variety and more events happening in front of me i really should warp further into the galaxy as fast as i can.

"Awesome comback Hello Games! 

Enjoying the NEXT Update since release and the overhaul to about every aspect of the game really is impressive. From the improved visuals, the streamlined start of the game*, to the deeper crafting and base building options. I didn’t think I would like the 3rd person view but now I find it hard to go back to 1st person view.

Very well done Hello games! 


*At the start of the game maybe increase hazard protection to 33-45%? New players don't know what to do and will look around, chase that animal, try the multi tool etc and not react to the mission promts - and then die. The first few minutes are very scripted in that the game expects the player to immediately follow the instructions to repair the scanner in order to find the yellow stuff to pump up hazard protection. It needs to be toned down a bit so it does not become furstrating to new players. So either increase the starting hazard protection levels or do not spawn players on hazardous planets to begin with.



A few things I’d like to see in the future.

- Volcano’s and lava rivers / pools of lava on e.g. very hot planets. Maybe also toxic rivers / oceans?

- More varied plant and animal live that is crazy / weird / scray  and not a deer with a dog / lion face and butterfly wings, or cutezy walking teddy bears and more akin to the “whispering egg” creatures - think Alien, Pitch Black, the Thing etc.

- Ruined SciFi mega cities / cities on planets to show the sentinel war repercussions.

- Variations to space station interior – for some reason Gek, V’kyyn and Korvax built their stations with identical layout. Have stations interior look different for each race and have layout variations for each station.

- More than one model for a crashed on planet freighter! It’s the exact same every time!!!

- More and species related variations to ancient ruins – same ruin every time!!!  

- More variation in planetary outpost buildings and sizes- same combinations show up too often.

- Crazy thunder storms and lightning, huge tornados, wired plasma / energy storms - you know the SciFi kind of storm.

- Ship customization - let us pick and choose the parts to create our own ships and colors!",True

"I'll try and be brief: if you have patience or if you are willing to suffer some impatience for a grand story and a vast world that feels as real as it did when you first played Skyrim or Knights of the Old Republic; do take this game on.

The beginning is a tad sluggish and slow where game-play is concerned since you're bascially nothing, with nothing and can't do a lot. It takes time, practice and effort to become skilled, wealthy and knowledgable about the lore and the game machenics and when you've become all that it's a pretty breezy ride from there. 

I love the learning curve and the real experience of progress.

The best would be the forests though. No game that I've ever played has ever reached such high level of immersion. Play it with high video settings and a good headphone. You'll feel like you're roaming in a real forest.",True

You can also choose to make friends or lose friends here. This is a game with a Hardcore Survival aspect. 

You will have Sodium/Sugar/Energy levels just about anything you can think of. You will have heartbeats that will keep your heart going a mile a minute while playing. 

This game is just insane, yes I've gone through some bad bugs where I've lost fully kitted weapons multiple times but that's Early Access for you. I'm not going to belittle a Dev Team of only 17 people while Dayz prances around with their 300 and somehow manage to compare the 2 together. No.

If you like puzzle games with light platformer elements that can be just a teensy bit morbid, you'll really like this game! I've only played through the ""story"" just once but there is a ton of replay value with secrets in each level so don't be fooled by my playtime!

"Quern - Undying Thoughts is beautiful.  It is a Sisyphean task to create a puzzle game that will appeal to all since the challenges must be surmountable but involve enough thought so as not to roll down into a clicker game.  I personally like to have my grey matter stretched but I do not enjoy having to combine calculus with chess and hope that I noticed a word on a wall discoverable only within the first 2 minutes of gameplay.  I will say the puzzles were tilted towards the mechanical side of the equation as opposed to the theoretical, which is true to the story as they have been physically created as both tests and a guide.  The puzzle progress is linear, but this remains true to the theme of the story.  I did hit the forums near the beginning of the adventure at one point where I could not determine where there even was a path to follow, but in retrospect, there were clues.  This keyed me into noting what might guide me later.  If you are looking for the New York Times Sunday Diagramless, the puzzles might seem dissapointly easy.  However, I enjoy feeling the satisfaction of solving challenges on my own rather than just clicking along to a walk through so I found them well ballanced.  If you want a gorgeous environment with enjoyable puzzling all wrapped up in a capable story line, Quern is a gem.",True

I stopped playing for a little bit and just returned, everything that I once loved about this game is gone and really doesn't feel the same at all. I enjoyed the new mapping system and what not but to me it seems like the developers are much more focused on turning this game into a pure mobile game.

"Before I start, I'm mostly comparing the gameplay mechanics and plot to Dishonored 1.

I loved the Dishonored series but i feel like this one is a bit lacklustre compared to Dishonored 1. Mostly because in Dishonored 1, [spoiler] you sympathise with a little Emily Kaldwin and aim to take down the regime with the ending affecting her. [/spoiler] (NO SPOILER edn : Dishonored 1 contains sentimental value, Dishonored 2 doesnt) Here, its more of a removing a regime that forced its way to you, like a Thor: Ragnarok style. This may not affect other people but it affects me. 

Although, yes, you could play as two different characters, there is really no real replayability value after you completed it. I do not have a sense of satisfaction completing the game compared to completing Dishonored 1. Its a game others may thoroughly enjoy, but for me, it is my cup of tea, although i would like it a little sweeter.

TLDR : 7.5/11

"My thoughts on Counter Strike Global Offensive are that its one of those games that once you start playing and get with the community and such, you get addicted. The way you can collect skins and how competitive the ranking system is just brings you back to rank up more. The Counter Strike community is stronger than ever with the workshop and how veterans of the game help the rookies. This game is growing and will continue to grow. The downside to this game is how the ranking system is currently falling apart. What i mean is if you were MGE, which is a good rank in competitive, and you derank or lose your rank. It is too hard to get back up to it right now. Also, people are finding to many little glitches that can let you see through a smoke grenade or they are just plain out hacking to get up in the ranks. The people that you go against that are not hacking make a fun competitive 30 minute game. I will continue to play this game as long as i have a computer to be honest.",True

"i'm mixed on this one. while i like the game i feel like there is some weird bugs in it. there is an audio issue that seems to come up every once in a while. i noticed it crashed right after that on the last run i did in the game. now besides that weird thing i do love historic games.  gives you an insight to the warfare of the time or the mindsets of some of the countries back then. 

you learn a little about history as you play these games. so i do like total war games and this one is still fun just i'm not sure where i stand with the audio issue.

forgot to add one bug that was odd. while i was chasing down mobs i saw one left. went to it and it was a cannon crew. what was odd was there was no one left alive just the horses. so i had to wait out the time fast forward. even then the battle didn't end like it normally does. i had to quit the battle. thank god it wasn't a loss by doing that. only time i've ever seen that bug.",True

The game doesn't take very long to complete if you discount the fact that you have to scour areas for side collectibles. The puzzles aren't very hard either but you do get a satisfying feeling as you solve one mystery after another and find yourself one step closer to the ultimate truth.

This is the perfect game to put you in the place of a First Order janitor that has to clean up after one of Kylo Ren's hissy-fits.

1. The ""Bro"" Review

""Hey, bro, so, like this game, I was walkin' around this cool lookin' wasteland with this crazy lookin' rifle that shoots partcles 'n schtuff and this giant green hermit crab pops outta the ground and I'm like 'whaaa' then I shot it till it's head popped off. It was sweet. Then I found some meat on it, cooked it and ate it to get my health back. Then I found this chick who was like 'where's my son?' and I was like 'wanna help' and she was like 'sure' and we went and killed these robot dudes at this house-thing, and she turned out to be their leader and it was like a trap and like yeah. Yeah bro, it was sick.""

2. The Great Wall of Text Review

Bethesda gives you more ""dungeons"", random encounters, customizability, and sheer map size than anything I've seen in their other games. You can use this however you'd like to, but the real fun and challenge comes in crafting a character that uniquely suits your playstyle. Stealth-oriented players can sneak up on enemies for massive damage multipliers and tanky minigun toting power armor users can cut through a ghoul (zombie) swarm like a hot knife through butter, but be wary of the drawbacks.

Get caught in a bottleneck, nimble rogue, and the game will crush you like a radroach. Come back with a suit of power armor and you may fare better, but if you waked there you're probably out of power and can't walk back. If you make that journy, you've got an expensive repair bill on your hands with materials that have to be found. After a while you might set up a few settlements and find people to do the work for you, but if building houses, beds, farms, and wells for those people isn't your thing, then don't do it.

So what do you do? Like life, find something that suits you. Aimless wandering is what these games are known for, but they're numerous factions, military, technological, or otherwise, that are desperate for your support. These choices bear their own consequences, and that's what makes this game great. 

I wouldn't recommend this game to someone who isn't comfortable with great freedom of choice in their journey. Linear gameplay is incredibly rare here, as even the deepest bunker or tallest building is littered with interconnecting rooms, trap doors, access stairways, and rooftops. Tactically oriented players can scout the building with a night vision scope, go up the fire escape to take out the snipers on the roof and enter through the access hatch to find themselves perched on a catwalk that overlooks the baddie littered factory floor below. It's easy pickings from there, but you want to charge in the front door, no one's stopping you.

If you die in there, you'll take more of a hit to your ego than anything. There's no save checkpoints you have to hit to keep yourself backed up, just an autosave feature that'll save you if you forget to hit the quicksave button every now and then. Those of you looking for a challenge might be disgusted that the game's difficulty can be so easily circumvented, but in an age of multiplayer games where everything you do can be compared to other players,this game set the onus of performance sits squarely on your shoulders. Do what you do, and do it well, because you and only you will know that it was good. 

A word of warning to my perfectionistic brethren. You can make yourself hate this game if you're not careful. You can only carry so much, and while you can fast travel back to base to dump your scavenged materials, just take tbe ripest fruits and don't spend all day evaluating which items are most deserving. Management aspects like this are fun and rewarding, but they cater to players who want to watch their resources grow over time. Learn to prioritize early on and remember that time is the only resource in scarcity. 

Play this game if you enjoy working at making your character good, running across cool looking monsters, interesting people, and epic items that can dish out gratuitous amounts of damage. With corny retro music playing in the background the whole time.",True

This game is a must for everyone",True
"Gameplay is fun, but battles become very quickly repetitive. There are a lot of fun mechanics that kept surprising me to the end. Side quests are meh but they do feel like they are part of the main quest rather than just for the sake of grinding. Once you finish the game, the game opens up with new content to explore either through new game+ or simply reloading a previous *cleared* save. The worst place was the trial of water, you have to avoid being seen by a blue eye by using one of your abilities. If you do get seen, you are transported all the way to the start of the trial which frustrated me to no end. My advice is to look for the eye on the ground, because you must be seen by that one in order to move on. There is neither dialog, nor any form of hint to tell you that, and it is only by running on it in frustration I figured that one out.

The story is generic and typical Japanese i.e. kids save the world, hesitant hero that can at times be annoying, he gets his ass kicked but through some dialog arise to kick ass.

Music is without a constant genre, so it changes, while this is interesting, it pulled me out of the game a lot. Also, I don't remember a single song so thematically, it is underwhelming.

Most of the audio memory bank went to dialog and there is a lot of it. I found the acting of Mikleo to be the best one. Sorey had great moments too, but it fell flat on certain scenes. The female cast, I fear, had to imitate the Japanese performance too much, which caused them to become caricatures and fail. Denzel was pretty bad too.
Some of the best acting came from side characters. 
Japanese audiences like when characters say the name of their abilities as they are cast. Unfortunately, it becomes very annoying too quickly and it got to the point I had to mod away the battle voices.
There is also a name mistake in the game. During one of the combat victory scenes, Sorey says Mikleo as Mikleeah


Sound design had some interesting moments but I felt it was really lacking outside of the anime cutscenes. Weapons sound the same, characters have no foley (cloth and armor movement sounds) when they move around, though Alisha  got some armor sounds during cutscenes, which was a nice touch, and spells are without any power behind them.

Graphics are fine, but I had to download a tool to make it run in 60FPS which is bullshit. At times, the eyes look very dead and you have no idea who they are looking at. While I really like the 2D skit scenes, I rather do without it if I can customize my characters as this is not reflected in the 2D art (Obvious why it isn't.) I am not a big fan of equipment you can put on that doesn't change the look of the character save the weapon. The customizing you can do, feels at times too silly and not very impressive though I did like the topknot. There seems to be a bug that causes characters to pop in and out very quickly, which annoyed the hell out of me.

While I can recommend the game, I would shy away from it if you are looking for a deep storyline, great voice acting and mind blowing graphics.

"A lot of people seem to be calling this a ""walking simulator"" but in my mind it's much more of a ""talking simulator"". If I read that I would think it sounded pretty lame, but my feelings are quite the opposite. I have never played a game where the dialogue (and the whole game really) felt more authentic or immersive.

I almost hesitate to call it a game rather than some sort of interactive experience. If you're looking for a fun adventure game you'll probably be somewhat disappointed but if you're wanting an immersive interactive character study than I can't think of a better option.

The ""game"" teases you throughout with a greater mystery but it doesn't unfold how a lot of people expect/want it to which I think lead to a lot of the bad reviews disappointed by the ending.  If you look at it from the perspective of getting to know and experiencing the two main characters, however, then I personally find the ending to be perfect. It's not a crazy climactic action movie ending, it's just a hauntingly authentic human conclusion to a screwed up chapter in these characters lives.

"I really really really wish I could do more than just thumb it down. It is literally one of the worst games on steam right now.

Don't listen to anyone telling you it is a good game. They are brainwashed fangirls who would defend this game even if it costed their life. Every single aspect of this game is broken. Anti-cheat does not exist. Hit reg is beyond bad. Lag is bad. Don't believe the devs when they said it's a finished game now. It is not. If they keep working on it at the same pace it still needs about 5 to 6 years of work and most of the systems need a major overwork. If you don't own this game, don't buy it. If you just bought it, refund it. If you own it since more than 2 weeks. I feel sorry for you. You're stuck with it and can't get your money back just like me.",False

"Every now and then I pick up this game to have some fun, and every single time I quit in a fit of rage.  This time it was a mother storm where you can go look for loot crates and bust them open, except half the time they don't bust open, and half the time even if they do, the loot goes flying away in the wind, and good luck chasing it down and not having your car destroyed in the process by flying debris, tiny rocks on the ground, or AI enemies who are wholly unaffected but the massive storm that's thrashing you and your car. 

Usually, though, I ragequit because the controls are so damn clunky that I wind up dying when I shouldn't have.  You're supposed to press Right Mouse Button to parry?  Even if you press RMB with the indicator up, it doesn't always work.  And because of the garbage multi-purpose bound keys (press or hold), if you're a split second too late on the parry, Max will stand still to pull out his shotgun... in a game where the fighting mechanics require you to keep moving to win a fight.  You literally cannot move and aim with your shotgun.  If you have your shotgun (the ONLY gun in the game) in your hand, you MUST be standing still to fire it, and it takes about a full second to pull off a shot.  There are moments where you need to shoot down enemies that are suspended in the air, but the three-step STOP, PULL OUT, FIRE system causes you to only get to the ""pull out"" step before getting your head bashed in by the enemies behind you who DIDN'T stop. 

I don't know why in the world they went with multiple uses for the same key.  I know the game was designed for the consoles, but how hard could it have been to use more keys than WASD, E, F, TAB, and Space? Why not Q, C, V, G, T?  Instead of having me hold a button to do one thing and press it to do another, just make separate keys so the command can be done instantly!



And then there's all that other criticism about the game being repetitive and bland, the car combat being incredibly tedious (AI is always faster than you while attacking a convoy route; you can't outrun the escorts, who do disproportionate damage to you even if your car is maxed out), the clunky movement that's somehow WORSE than GTA V, and literally all the camps looking the exact same (with the tedium of searching every nook and cranny for that last piece of scrap).

I'm done with it.

"Ammended because I always doubt if the game was really as bad as I think it is:
Yes, my doubt has been confirmed once again. I don't play for months and then I return hoping that DTG has addressed the core-problems of this game.
No. You still have to disable the puke your heart out because we hate you motionblur with a key-press, instead of it becoming a permanent setting in the options.
No, Unreal Engine crashes still happen near the end of scenarios.
No, DTG still has not seen it opportune to clarify their scenarios, or to add tips to concepts they introduce in scenarios they never talked anout in the tutorials, requiring the gamer to ask around on forums or the have the Wiki on a tablet on the side.
Sometimes I wonder why I stopped buying the expansions after GWR and I boot the game, ignorant to the problems that it has, only to be reminded and to have my profound dislike for this game refreshed, renewed and deepened. The passage of time in between my play merely underscores that time is the great terminator.
To repeat an oldie pet-peeve of mine concerning DTG: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD HIRE PEOPLE WHO CAN CODE IN UNREAL4!!
KTHNXBAI.

Ammended for Rapid Transit:
I didn't obtain RT. Previous experience with TSW has made me skittish about getting more DLC. I did however watch a lot of Sim-channels on Youtube and it seems to me that RT is by far too expensive a buy for the content that you get with it. You get very little value for your money as this expansion is content-starved and very thin on interactivity. You'll get about the same experience by watching vids by train-enthusiasts riding the line for real.

Edit:
Dovetail has added a motion-blur toggle. This is huge, so hence the edit. It's quite an experience to play this game without a barf-bag at the ready. Other problems mentioned still exist, but this step done by Dovetail makes me cautiously hopeful for the future. Imagine a day where this review will be changed to positive! That'll be something.

Ammended for Great Western Railway DLC:
My original review for CSW:Heavy Haul can be 1:1 transplanted to GWR. Still unoptimized, still tutorials that refuse to go indepth despite the indepth ambitions, still unacceptable framerates, still the Unreal struggling to load in assets before you drive by, still load-stutter, still no way disable vomit-inducing motionblur.
This time, add Unreal-crashes into the mix, preferably the ones that happen near the end of a 50 minute scenario.
If nothing moves, including you, CSW is still a beautiful game and you can see and understand where Dovetail is trying to go with CSW. If only they hired developers who actual;ly know how to code in Unreal. That would help a lot.

Original Review:
CSX Heay Haul is first and foremost a beautiful game, with an unprecedented level of detail not only in the gameworld, but also in the simulation. That's also the only positive thing that I can say at this moment about this simulator.

Its further spectacularly buggy, runs like mollasses on a high end system that's ranked in the top 1% in the Steam survey, has tutorials that don't teach important concepts while being more like a glorified quick-start glossary than a worthwhile learning tool and introduces new and unexplained concepts in the game proper on top of that.

CSX Heavy Haul is therefore obtuse, frustrating and unenjoyable. Only recommended if you want to be sandwiched in a double penetration by the twin-evils called Trial and Error.",False

"I've already completed and enjoyed this game on PS4, only to buy it again on PC because I loved it so much.


If you're on the fence because of performance issues, I still think you should take the plunge with this game.
When I started up the game I had a pop-up on my monitor saying the input was out of range, and the display was blurry.
After about 30 minutes of figuring out what was wrong, and installing the FAR mod the issue was quickly solved, and the game was running perfectly. 


Of course, you may get a completely different outcome. This is a Platinum game on PC afterall, and their games can perform very odd on different hardware configurations. Automata runs excellent for me after a bit of tweaking, but it's hard to say if it will for everyone else.


The 2 hour limit of Steam refund is more than enough time to see if the game runs well for you. 
It took me 30 minutes to tell I was in the clear. If the game is having issues for you even with the FAR mod installed, you can always refund it as long as you have under 2 hours of play time. Definitely check it out if you're worried about performance, but are interested in it.",True

I’ve already clocked a number of hours into this game today. I can honestly say, it runs well… damn well! I love it! Brings me right back to where Human Revolution left off and I’m f**k’n excited!

In my opinion, the game looks GREAT! Yes it crashed once… actually, twice. Just now as I’m writing this review actually. But you know what, I don’t care! The devs patch whatever problems there are. S**t happens. Get over it.

Simply put. If you’re a Deus Ex fan, GET IT! If you enjoy the cyberpunk, futuristic theme, get this game! It’s a shooter. Its stealth combat. Customizing weapons, minor crafting, upgrades and augs… I love it!

Micro transactions = The cost of doing business goes up. Inflation is a b***h. Own or operate a business for 5 to 10 years and you’ll understand. The cost of a cheese burger 10 to 15 years ago, isn’t the same as it is now. Should these gaming companies raise the cost of their games to $70 or $80 to compensate for the costs of doing business? Most likely no one would buy them (look at the reviews). So the other option is to find the money elsewhere. I have no problem paying $5 ot $10 dollars extra for something I enjoy. You can’t put a price on happiness and entertainment. Deus Ex still a complete game. If you don’t want to drop the $5 dollars, then don’t. But don’t knock this game because a business is trying to increase profits. Unfortunately, not all developers are like CD Projekt Red. And unfortunately, not everyone understands business. And unfortunately, not everyone has an extra $5. I get it. But in and of itself, the game is great. Don’t let the micro transactions bandwagon distract you from this fact.

"I've been playing video games for as long as I can remember and it seems like the virtual experience we are usually offered is a violence ladden death tour.   I wanted to try a game that wasn't about violence or completing commando missions so I tried Firewatch.   While this game puts you on a linear story and gains the descriptor a ""walking simulator"", it does allow you to roam a stretch of forest with just enough sense of danger that adds a sense of urgency.  There are no missions requiring you to bludgeon zombies to death or ""shoot and scoot"" thorugh an ambush.  If that's what you are looking for you will be dissapointed as there are no weapons in this game.   An axe for completing mission goals is about all you get in that regard.      The story was short, casual but interesting with an interesting but sad twist.    I won't talk about the story because that is what this game is all about.  Telling a story.   The game is the story and plays like an animated/narrated book.    You don't have any real choices as the game progression is based on the next linear scripted event.  However, I covered that already.     The graphics and soundscape are cartoonish but detailed enought to draw you into believing you are hiking a mountain trail. The game duration was short and you can complete in a few hours if you don't take time exploring the limited access terrain.   The map feels like an open world but it isn't.  You have trails that lead to open areas but you are restricted to where you can go.   Which wasn't a problem as the terrain is the backdrop for the storyline.   I think the storyline duration was just about right as I was getting a little bored of the tedious back and forth hiking in some parts of the game.   If the story went any longer I would have got bored with it and gave up.    You play the plot from a first person perspective and it works.  It was entertaining and I this was just what I was looking for.   A high quality, bug free, non-violent escape from reality playing out the plot of a mild unexpected mystery novel.   Very enjoyable for those looking for a casual non-violent escape.",True

"Great 'gateway game' to FTG imo.

Graphics pretty much resembles the original series, and there are tons of detail and references a fan (including me)may find exciting.

Controls are friendly to newcomers, at least compared to other titles from Acrsys.

Network was once a significant drawback, but now there is local lobby so you no longer need to put up with those potato servers even for just a round in Arcade. Don't know much about the status of servers right now because it took me 40 hours just in single-player and I'm still having fun. 

So if you are not a big fan of DB series I recommend to wait for a discount(doesn't seem to happen anytime soon though), or go for a FighterZ edition since the anime music pack is a scam -_-

"This game is a lot familiar to the mobile game: Galcon the only difference is that there some different units to use. There are minion spawners, you capture them to generate more minions and you can upgrade standart minions using the different unit upgrade points.

This game is fun if you liked Galcon and that type of micro strategy games you will like this one. The only let down for me so far was: There is no 3,4,5... multiplayer support and I am not sure if it is coming or not. All you can do is a 1v1 match as far as multiplayer is concerned. AI(Single player) is not so bad, hard difficulty provides some challenge but if you are familiar with the genre; it is really trivial to beat them.

Graphics are nice and Sounds are better. Game UI and menus are a bit dull, but hey! It can be improved. Units are balanced and game itself allows players to micro manage units. You can't put hotkeys to units( like AOE(M), Starcraft etc... CTRL + number ) or I could not manage it anyway, that was another let down for me. 

All in all, I recommend this game. It is really worth the price. Single player is a bit boring after you figure out units and stuff but multiplayer is hella fun.  We need more players for multi so, buy this game!!",True

Reguarding the conection, had barely any issue, obviously ran into some connection problems, since it was launch and quite a bunch of players, but nothing that a good rematching did not fix, and nothing that compromises my experience.

"To sum it up, S.T.A.L.K.E.R: SoC is a solid game. I'm going to start with the downsides so that this review will finish on a high note.

Firstly, the game has some massive bulletsponging. Enemies are ridiculously resistant to even the most powerful of weapons. There have been many situations where an enemy has been standing perfectly still about 30 meters from me, and yet, about 15 precise shots out of 30, all hitting his chest and above, do little else but leave some bloodstains on the wall behind. Simply put, enemies are WAY too spongey.

Now you're probably thinking ""15 shots out of 30? This guy is probably really innacurate."" I would think the same, if the game didn't have ""hit probability"". Every time you hit an enemy, the game will roll the dice and decide ""Did that bullet actually hit or not?"" Whatever the game rolls, goes. You can miss perfectly placed shots just because the game said so. Luckily, however, the weapons you accquire later in the game narrow down these innacuracies massively.

So, me being a known hater of RNG like this, why am I not shitting all over this game? Mods. With a small combination of two mods, both of which are perfectly compatible, you can get solid shooting mechanics. These mods are [url=http://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-complete-2009]Stalker Complete 2009[/url] and its small addon mod, [url=http://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-complete-2009/downloads/sc-realistic-weapons-add-on]SC Realistic Weapons.[/url]

Now you're probably wondering what these mods do? They drastically improve the efficency of all weapons, for a start. Now, regardless of how bulletspongey an enemy is, they cannot sponge these new bullets. Your fancy new weapons are devastating. Immediately, this sounds unbalanced, but it's easily balanced by turning the game to Master difficulty, which will put you on a level playing field, making you just as fragile as your enemies. It truly makes combat hard unless you're strategic and take your enemies by surprise, preferably via flanking.

So, now that you've heard of the combat system, next up is a spoilerless review of the ending. There are multiple endings to this game, 5 of them being bad and 2 of them being good, yet, the game tilts any player who is unaware of these multiple endings towards the worst of them. I can only give you one tip for actually getting a semi-decent ending. Do NOT enter the nuclear power plant with more than 50,000 Rubles(RU), the currency of Stalker. This is the end of the game and you'll likely have no use for this money, but the game will give you a terrible ending if you have too much money, with no prior warning that this money would cause such an ending. This ending overrides all others, effectively meaning no matter how ""Morally correct"" your character was, if you have more than 50,000 RU, you get a bad ending. It's definitely not a good design choice, seeing as with a normal playthrough where I didn't even bother collecting the extremely valuable weapons of fallen enemies to sell, I still finished with +160,000 RU.

Also, although you may have heard this game had stealth, it's barely stealth. You can indeed sneak around a little and get deep into a base before being spotted, but to approach an enemy in anyway, even from behind whilst crouched as low as possible, means detection. You're bound to be spotted. You can actually sneak up on an enemy and take him out silently, but that always results in everyone else somehow knowing that you're there, ruining the advantage you had.

And lastly, my final complaint. The final thing I have to say against this game, is that it has abysmal loading times. Most other games can load up a quicksave in a matter of seconds, but it takes almost 15 seconds to load a quicksave in this game, and nearly a whole minute to just load up the game.

Now, onto the pros of this game...

Some great shooter mechanics, mixing bullet spread, different weapon types and some very nice combat AI into one giant moshpit of crafty Stalkers trying to outflank eachother. The AI is smart (most of the time) and will actually flank around you and take you by surprise.

Next up, an expertly designed inventory. I can easily see what I want to take and I can take it quickly.

A nice ranking system for all Stalkers in the game, essentially showing how good you're getting compared to all the other scrubs in a neat little table. Although it's hard, I actually went on a hunt, searching for the Stalker's right below me ( I was the number 1 Stalker at this point) and I made some improvised assassination missions based around killing off these expert Stalkers. That was quite fun.

The game is open world, and isn't too massive, so traversing it isn't very hard.

It's got some great atmosphere. I once hung around a group of independent Stalkers (Loners, as they're called) as they gathered around their small barrel fire in a broken down warehouse that we just defended together. After a while of hanging around, sitting down and drinking Vodka like true Russians, good ol' Georg Ax sitting on the other side of the fire whipped out a harmonica and turned this into a real blues situation. After all that, the group started talking and making jokes (in Russian, sadly) and started laughing, playing around and generally enjoying the peace before the storm. The day after that, a group of bandits raided the warehouse while I was gone and killed everyone except the two guards out front, who, if I recall correctly, were named ""Genka SWAT-Officer"" and ""Borya Simulator""... I don't know where they get these names from, but I would love to know if there was a Ms. Simulator, no sexual reference intended.

There was that other time where I had just finished a daring nighttime mission where I raided a lab. Now I just escaped from the aforementioned lab, and the Military were outside, searching for me. Under the cover of the nightime rain, I ran, barely able to see two feet in front of me (this game is really dark at night). I was running through a small stream with bullets trialing after me, but they lost me quickly because it was nighttime. 

This entire mission had just been a daring, life-risking task where I died many times and had to use a lot of resources, but now it was over. I had just to run across about two miles of terrain the dark, rain and lightning. I finally reached home, battered, low on ammo and supplies, but safe. Never have I ever been so happy to just see some friendly characters in a game, and a nice campfire with some people huddled around.

Simply put, this game wins tons of points in terms of atmosphere, and although the story is nothing exceptional, it certainly works well with the atmosphere of the game.

Lastly, the final thing I want to say is that the game has a great factions system, with about 5 factions, Duty, the faction set on restoring order to the zone, Freedom, the faction set on controlling the zone and restoring it, just through different methods to Duty, Monolith, the religious faction who worship a magical rock named the ""Monolith"", the Bandits, a group of people who just rob everyone and generally be dicks (they killed Georg Axe, the fuckers) and the Loners, the independent Stalkers who just go about their business without getting caught up in factions. You can manipulate these factions, gaining different statuses in each of them that effect your game later on when suddenly run into a group of people who hate you enough to shoot you dead on the spot, even though you thought they were still friendly...

That's about it. The game is really good with a few mods.

And lastly, CHEEKI BREEKI!",True
Literally my favorite game of all time. Played a couple hundred hours. Really fun!,True
"i think this game is quite okay, definitely could do more stuff.
The first thing is the lock system... frankly speaking it doesnt really help at all..
with the lockpicking skill people can just open ur cabin and steal everything.
they can also destroy it while ur offline.i saw many ""ruins"" , i don't feel safe leaving my cabin when im offline.
people can literally come and claim ur buildings (it happen to me while im writing this) 
2nd : the amount of item u can stack is too little... why can we only have 10 stack of copper , iron and stuff? can't u made it like 99 stack  ?? 
3rd : the rotation between night and day is awful.. it's too fast and also night time is too dark.
having torches and bonfire didn't really make a difference... 

i'll say ... if u want to give locks for buildings make it really hard for people to steal from.
make the defense systems like towers to really do their job *protecting people witihin its protection
and not just making a tiny itsy bitsy scratch to red name players looking to kill /steal from others.
adjust the amount of stacked items we can carry , 10 stack is just too little...

well i guess that's all i can think of now.
I really looking forward for better updates , or back to the minecraft we go :)

PS: I recommend u play with friends or form groups with people.It might be safer :)",True
This is a good game but its not for the basic fallout fan however,True
"It's a pretty good game. More than good enough to earn a recommendation.

To be honest, though, it wasn't quite what I wanted. Compared to Bastion this feels too serious, almost bordering on pretentious; like the team at Supergiant forgot how to have fun some time after their first success.

Forgetting Bastion for a moment, what does this game have to offer?
- Great 2D artwork
- Incredible music
- A fairly interesting story and world
- Neat gameplay: The ""Function system"" provides an impressive amount of depth and variety
- Good design encourages exploring the ""Function system"" while you learn more about key characters
- Going through the small levels there are ""sightseeing"" (points of interest, terminals) and lots of combat

What am I less thrilled about?
- I tried so hard to enjoy this ""sightseeing"" aspect, but it was only mildly engaging.
- It is incredibly linear. Though I used the word sightseeing, don't expect much in the way of exploration or relevant choices (outside of which functions to use where and when).
- It is a short game. I didn't rush; I took my time, reading everything, finding terminals... My playtime includes two full playthroughs and then some. I didn't do all the optional challenges since I didn't enjoy them all that much.

Conclusion:
The game is a competently put together work of art that I wish I enjoyed more than I do.

"[b]PROS:[/b]
+ great art style
+ awesome tower defense elements
+ cool puzzles/levels
+ fun achievements
+ level specific events
+ Heroic & Iron mode level variant
+ 16 heroes to choose from

[b]CONS:[/b]
- some people will find it too easy compared to Kingdom Rush
- not all heroes are useful in the more difficult stages
- makes you angry when that last minion ruins your perfect score

[b]Comment:[/b]
After playing and really enjoying Kingdom Rush I was happy that the sequel appeared here on Steam. This game is possibly easier than Kingdom Rush as less of a specific mix is needed. Towers often have special variants that make them eventually viable for almost any enemy. This is the trade-off so you can play the way you want. Three expansion unlock after finishing the main campaign, each adds new units to make the gameplay fresh and a bit more difficult. You have a lot of heroes to choose from but apart from maybe the expansions there is no real reason to level them up. You can just pick the one you like and get him to maximum level and just keep using him/her. Though I have to say not all of them are usable in the later levels, especially the expansions. I had an occasional game freeze (FPS drop) when a tower is built or hero revives but it happened only on some levels and not always. During the campaign most of the stages have a special event (sand worm, ship cannons, etc.) that makes the gameplay more dynamic as you have to adjust to event while fighting enemies. Overall a really great sequel and definitely a game to check out if you are into tower defense games!

[b]P.S.:[/b] Great Defender, Heroic Defender & Iron Defender probably only unlock in Normal or Hard difficulty (this was the case in the first game), but you only need to finish the first 15 levels to unlock them

"Still in early access so there are a lot of missing features that are still being worked on, but aside from some missing bits, this is some of the most fun I've had in a long wile with a rogue-like game!

"TL:DR: Great game to play with friends, interesting plot and good gameplay, hours of fun.

After two runs and a half on this game, I can tell that I really enjoyed my time on it. I cannot tell about the single player experience however, because I haven't played the game alone, I always played it on coop, the only difference is that the guy accompanying you is a friend, and not an AI.

The gameplay is really good to me, being a fan of QTEs, I really enjoyed it, it's fluid, the difficulty rises with the levels, and it keeps a great interest with the different characters having different ways to be played. You'll be sent through hours of epic action that would, according to ""purists"", not suit the saga of Resident Evil, well, no offense, and with all due respect, screw them. This game may not be Resident Evil 4, but if you want more of it, just play it, it's a new game with new mechanics, a new plot, and a new way of being played.

Multiplayer modes also offer some versus modes that are interesting to play if you manage to gather enough people. It's not groundbreaking, but you'll be able to have so fun alltogether. Also, the possibility to accept players as special zombies is really fun and increases the difficulty at some points, if you're a tough player and get bored of slaughtering brainless meatpacks, you'll want to try this out.

Really, I can't find any real trouble about the game, it's not the game of the year, far from it, but it'll provide you with hours of fun to play with a friend, and if you want challenge, difficulty levels will provide you some, with less than 0.2 seconds for a crucial QTE, and if you have a hard time with them, you can still use something to lower the difficulty of these.",True
"I would recommend this game for the work that was put into the music and also some, if not most of the artwork. The music just fits perfect in the game and the artwork just looks amazing. The game is very very simple and there is not a lot to do it the game. But i enjoyed playing all the levels at 5 minutes each and loved every bit of listening to the music while i ate the enemy.

"I would recommend this game whole-heartedly, with the caveat that this is NOT a full 4X game.

Rather it's a diet 4X game for when you want those warm fuzzy feelings that come from seeing your empire expand and grow, without all the time and setup of a full 4X session.

What is the main attraction of this game is the Starships (it's in the title). From fighting off pirate attacks, to storming the capitals of enemy civs, the spacebattles are the real meat of the game. And to be honest, there's nothing as satisfying as seeing one of your ships blast a Death Star knockoff to smitherens in a single blast.

Biggest con: the menus don't scroll to let you see all the options. Firaxis, would it have killed you to take a day or so to fix that?",True

"I thought I'd put up a review for this really underappreciated little game. 

Developer Arcen Games makes wildly creative, deep, and eccentric genre-benders, the most celebrated of which is their asymmetrical space RTS/4x/tower defense, ""AI Wars."" AI Wars is clearly a great game, but somehow it's this one that I keep coming back to.

Bionic Dues is Arcen's take on a ""roguelike,"" but of course in proper Arcen style it is totally unique. 

Basically, it has a lot in common with a proper roguelike: you guide your characters through a series of procedurally generated dungeons. But there are a *lot* of interesting twists:

- You have 4 characters, (which are actually some sort of mecha exoskeleton?) in any combination of ""classes,"" but can only use one at a time, and it takes a turn to swap them out.

- Loot and inventory customizaton is of primary importance. Each bot has *tons* of inventory slots, in several categories, and each class is different. Carefully poring over the hundreds of components you find, and optimizing their arrangement on each robot chassis, balancing your overall strategy, is the part of the game that I find utterly addictive. (It feels a lot like ship design in Gratuitous Space Battles, another of my favorites.)

- There is a sort of top-level strategy layer linking the dungeons. In between runs, you re-arrange robot parts, and choose your next raid target based on likely risk/rewards and your overall position in the map, with a global counter ticking down to a final level full of particularly nasty enemies. 

- Understanding enemy AI and abilties is really important. There are a lot of enemy bot types, with simply-defined behaviors that are nevertheless complex in their interactions, and they appear in randomized combinations that can really change the way you approch a given dungeon.

- The game can be played with a number of different difficulty options, and core gameplay modifiers like the addition of permadeath, ironman mode, and time-limits on turns. This really allows you to tweak the game to your liking; you can choose to allow save-scumming, seeking the perfect run, or you can make it a much more tense and chaotic affair.

One thing that needs mentioning: a lot of the art assets are just awful-looking, especially on the strategy and inventory-management screens. To enjoy the game, you will have to be able to get over this, and see the item illustrations as purely functional conveyors of data. This works fine for me, but I'm sure it turns a lot of people off. Thankfully, I think the dungeon art is pretty nice-looking.

Frankly, I also found the music and voices to be awful (though a lot of the sound design itself is pretty nice,) and I tend just turn it off and listen to my own music.

Despite all the ugly warts, I keep coming back to this one. If you like procedural turn-based dungeon crawling, and find yourself spending a lot of enjoyable time comparing stuff on inventory screens, this might be a good one for you. 

I also like that it lends itself well to short play sessions; you can pop in for a quick dungeon or a bit of stat-crunching without feeling too committed. It's also a good game to have running in the background while you're doing something else, taking a turn now and then. 


All in all, this is a deep little game that's well worth its price tag - at the time of this writing, it's available at the ridiculous sale price of $1.99, and no roguelike fan should miss it.",True

"Sidmeier's Pirates is a remake of an older version of the Game and ticks all the boxes right for doing so. Having said that. I have 10.5 hours in it and finished it - that said higher difficulties from the start are still open to me, as you are obligated to start at the easiest difficulty when you first start the game but you can during the game up the difficulty by 'dividing the loot'.

It has several 'mini-games' including dancing/romancing governor daughters, attacking cities, and fighting on ships. These mini-games are not overly hard, but not too difficult that is just a breeze. As you can interspace them the way you want the mini-games are never bothersome, in my opinion.

The atmosphere and humor of the game is its major selling point and as such it a good little game for a bit of relaxing. And with the difficulties, different starting eras, and starting proficiencies you can definately make it harder on yourself to get a more challenging experience should you wish it, but to me it does not seem as if it was created to make you have deep low and mountain peak highs, but rather a relaxing giggle.",True
"Ahh well, this game looked so promising to play in MP with a friend. Turns out the game modes are sorta fubared to say the least. In SP game (offline) you can play against computer AI opponents.

In MP games, if you only have 1 friend online atm, you CAN NOT add any computer AI plus 1 friend. Its a choice of offline cpu AI or online friends only (no added AI). Basically a 1 vs 1 game - yea ok - no gun in that since this is a much better game to play with more opponents.

"Pros:
-Pretty damn horrifying in terms of both the atmosphere the game sets up and the gameplay.
-It is challenging and a survival game.
-Interesting characters and use of tools.
-Make sure to play in the dark with headphones for max immersion. Duh, horror games require that.

Cons:
-Nothing much. The game receives updates regularly and is finished. Looking forward to the second game or something similar from these developers.",True
Not to bad I like all the guns and attachments to them. response time need to be quicker for example picking up guns and getting into cars. also cant open doors while reloading kinda weird. in first person the view seems a little low. overall fun game!,True
"A gaming style very similar to GTA, with a slight twist. You are actually trying to make the world a better place and you have a cool grappling hook and parachute to help you do it. Oh, and a ton of adrenaline filled action to go along with it. Similar to GTA, you can hijack vehicles, piss off the authorities(Heat), complete story missions and side quests. Just Cause takes it a little further to give you a moral reason to fight.

There are a few downsides that arent too drastic. Sometimes travelling may seem to take forever and the landscape can get a little repetitive. As you play though, you will realise that its just a matter of finding the right transport. Also, a key aspect of the game is 'Chaos' which is generated when you destroy government marked utilities, complete missions and destroy millitary establishments. So instead of just going from mission A to mission B, you have something to keep you busy while you travel.

A must buy for anyone liking the GTA genre.",True

I only have a day of playing time for this game but this game is still probably one of the most fun games I have ever played. I just wish that this game can get fixed soon because the last update has some bugs in it unfortunately. Now whenever I try to build anything eventually the game wont let me place down anything except a basic block of wood no matter what block I have chosen to build with. However I do still enjoy this game very much becaue its a good game to get creative with your ship building. I just really hope that these bugs can be taken care of soon :D,True
"Very hard to start. Played for 1 and a half our and couldn't even reach sector 3. Not even on easy mode.

The difficulty selections are as follows :

EASY = Hard
Normal = Very Hard
Hard = Very Very Hard

For the rest it is a great game, if you can deal with dying a lot. 
But everytime you die you want to start again, in the hopes of destroying the Rebel Flagship.....

But you won't. 
This game requires skill and a strategy of attack for each different spaceship you encounter

Running away from one ship to only find yourself fighting against a stronger ship when you finish the jump.

Too difficult for my taste, not the game I expected it to be.

"This game was in my library for three years. THREE YEARS.

Between that time and 48 hours ago (as of the time of writing), I've played all but 8 hours of it, all within the Cyseal area, all with at least three different starts.

Why, you ask? Because the game overwhelmed me in a way other RPGs never have. The number of choices, options, interactivity, it was too much for me to handle. So last Friday, to celebrate having completed my thesis (for the most part), I decided to jump into this game again. This time, however, I decided to roll with whatever I get. Face the consequences, no matter how unfavorable.

And here I am, 24.4 hours later over the last two and a half days. The story is riveting. The gameplay fantastic. The music stellar. And the atmosphere sublime. This is one of the best games I've played in a long while, and I think it's even better than Pillars of Eternity.

"My list of issues I have with this game are far greater than the list of things I enjoy about this game. That being said, I still think you can easily get your money's worth out of this game, thus making it a recommendation from me. 

I have spent more time creating servers for this game than I have actually playing the game, so most of my complaints will come from the position of someone who runs servers.

[h1]Issues With Unofficial Servers[/h1]
[list]
[*]This game was not designed with private servers in mind, so support for private server owners is very minimal from the developers. The Github repos they provide us with come with very little information as to how you actually use the software, and instead make you rely on finding help online. Their Github repos have small Wiki sections that give little to no information, stating that there's ""more coming soon"", but that more doesn't seem to be coming. 
[*]The overall manor of how cells are linked together in a grid is extremely clunky, and rough for players in-game crossing over into new cells. They have the system setup in a way such that they can run their full 15x15 grid across multiple machines, but there wasn't much thought put into helping support smaller grids that are run on a single machine. What would be nice to see is instead of forcing a player transfer every time they cross a cell, change it so that grids on a single machine can be tethered together more cleanly. Ideally, I'd like to see a world where I can run a 3x3 grid that either has no transfer time between cells, or has just a few seconds of transfer time. As it stands, transfer times can take anywhere from 5-30 seconds, which is a real problem when you're sailing. Many times, players will spawn in on the other grid running straight into a tornado, or SOTD, or crashing into an island put too close to the border. I would be fine with these transfer times when transferring across machines through the Redis, but it's extremely annoying when it's all going on in one machine, in one central directory.
[*]In general, everything with properly setting up a server is a complete headache. The tools provided are very mediocre and come with little information as to how to use them, the game has bugs and issues itself that make you think you did something wrong, when in reality it's just a bug or glitch. Many people's first time setting up a simple map, even just a 2x2 grid, will take them 10+ hours. The only situation where running a server in a remotely easy fashion is if you completely ignore custom spawns, spawn regions, and the quest line. Even then, you have to spend a while finding the right islands, building a cohesive map, getting your settings right, and finding the best way for you to run and update things. 
[/list]

[h1]Issues With The Gameplay[/h1]
[list]
[*]Official servers are damn near impossible unless you join a large crew, or bring along a ton of dedicated friends with you to the game. The claim system allows players to bully each other, even in PvE. The claim system in PvE will often lead to toxicity among players, resulting in the players finding PvE ways to kill the person they're mad at. Neighboring tribes can easily sink your ship through putting too much weight on it, as well as easily aggro animals near your base while your'e offline, killing you, your tames, and parts of you base. They can then raid anything you left unlocked.
[*]Ships don't render unless they're right in your face. This is a huge issue on PvP, where people can easily escape just by getting out of render distance. Or if you're a slower ship, you only have 3-5 seconds to react to seeing a ship before that ship can start shooting at you. Increasing the distance at which you can see other ships would help the gameplay a lot.
[*]Thousands of bugs and issues with the game and the dev kit, but the game is early access so I won't go too hard on them for those.
[*]Probably a bunch else that I'm forgetting, but those are the main things that have been upsetting me lately.
[/list]

All that said, the game still has its fun moments. Its a great feeling being able to create a ship and then navigate to new, foreign lands. Going into the game blind, and not researching what islands have what adds a lot of adventure to everything. You enter a new grid, and can ask the locals of that grid what rare resources there are, and where you can get them, or who you have to fight to get them. Stumbling onto unclaimed islands, you get to have the fun of exploring, figuring out what all this island has to offer, and if you should be the one to claim it. 

The $30 price tag might be a bit steep, given all of the bugs and issues, but you can still probably squeeze that value out of gameplay. I'd definitely suggest picking it up when it's $15, as that price point definitely gives you a real bang for your buck.",True
Best game by far!,True
"Best platformer ever made, finally available on the best platform.

An older version of the game can be found for free on the internet, as an example here: http://www.kongregate.com/games/metanetsoftware/n.

You can just play that for a while and test if you like it or not. N++ is just a bigger and better version, with many times more levels, some unlockable cosmetic things, global highscores, (local) multiplayer and some overall polish. But the basic idea hasn't changed at all: perfect physics, no gimmicks, just short(ish) levels with difficulty ranging from ""lol"" to ""wat"".",True
"I honestly can't see why people hate this game so much. 
It's so cheesy, it's brilliant.

If you're after a laugh, this is a game to get. It's comical in so many ways.",True
"The game lacks polish. On High video quality, I'm running the game at 12fps. I had to reduce the video quality to the lowest setting which brought it up to a playable, but still unacceptable, 55fps range.

Doing anything feels ungodly slow, I have been playing the game for about an hour now, and I still have not been able to complete the tutorial stage. In one hand I blame the fps, but in the other hand, the gameplay just feels rushed a bit.

Red Dot and Play Wise should have spent more time developing the game before releasing a mess upon the Steam library.

I love Car Mechanic Simulator 2015; I think I have over 300 hours clocked in on that game. I was so excited to get CMS 2018, but right now I don't recommend it. Maybe there will be a day 3 patch to optimize the game a bit, and my review will become null, but I recommend to wait a little bit to buy this title.

I will check back with this game in about a week and hopefully the game will have some improvements.",False

"I download mods, it's fun. Main story is ok, I just like shooting people and building cities with my own two hands.

"Before I start I will say now that if you are interested in this game get it while its on discount. Now for the review... As of now with my 14.2 hours in the game I have yet to get bored, I haven't landed on any planet that has been the same and every planet and solar system is a new adventure. Although I agree with most people that this game should have been released as an early access and not a full game and definetely shouldnt be priced at 59.99 for what it is at the moment. But I can say I am enjoying the game and hope they update it more. I have a base up and running and some more stuff. I like the alien friendship system, and how after you trade and help aliens they become more familiar with you and become your friend and teach you their language. So yes I recommend the game but beware and get it on discount DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE FOR IT AT THIS STAGE. Things I dislike is flying and combat it feels half assed and idk if their is joystick support but if there is tell me and if there isnt its something i think they should add in the future for the ships. And the pricing of the ships are kinda out of proportion seeing how I bought a ship with 20 spaces for 346,238 Units and looked at a ship that was 29 spaces and the price jumped to 3 million units which is crazy if you ask me. But you have a YES from me.This game has potential.. Lots of it",True
My favourite AC game <3,True
great game,True
So far a really fun game. The controls aren't very intuitive and could have been put together a little more comprehensively. The pirates for some reason stand on top of one another and it makes combat pretty glitchy and unecessarily difficult. But those are minor issues and well worth it for the game. The one really glaring problem is stearing your boat. It may have the single worst interface I have ever seen in a game for the 20+ years I have played games and this includes Pitfall. Still worth dealing with because the rest of the game is super fun.,True

"It feels like Catusquid broke the cardinal rule of game design: Don't put story before mechanics. 

+The Writer was fun
+In depth look at events from the first game
+Interesting topics touched in the story
+Decent soundtrack
-Levels aren't as well designed
-Buggy and often inconsistent
-Little reason to enage the story or replay levels
-A reminder that the 1st one was better
-Too long

What was so amazing about the first game was the amount of detail in each stage being a functional level. It was inviting to the maniacal and the methotical. 

In this installment, the levels are too open and often unforgiving. The change of characters is too frequent for the player to develop a consistent playstyle like 'Jacket' of the first hotline miami, and there's no real engagement for the player to feel involved with any of the storylines. 

The dialogue of this Hotline is also about agency, but it feels disconected. Although I am controlling characters for parts of dialogue, I'm not as attached as I was with Jacket. The game touches on some interesting things like gender roles, violence in media, and nature vs nurture, but I felt little concern about what characters were discussing. The reasons why I should complete some levels wasn't presented as well as doing them for no reason as Jacket and having the psychological element. 

Often I felt bored or frustrated instead of challenged. I would consistently be killed from offscreen or I would be killed through a wall with melee, and this would shatter my experience. The most fun I had was as The Writer, who used classic playstyle to a new element. Aside from that, I felt helpless without a gun, and comboing wasn't as viable with the larger maps. 

With little reward from either gameplay or story, I feel this game just didn't have the love as its precursor did. This game didn't make me question as much about my potential taste for hurting other people. I would've prefered the story of this game just be contained within the digital comics, and a Hotline Miami 2 that flowed as smoothly as the first one. This game tries to do too much at once.",False

"Behold, the first Key/VisualArt's visual novel to make it onto Steam! Sekai Project already announced that they will be releasing Clannad on Steam as well, so you can be sure that this won't be the last.

Note that Planetarian is a kinetic novel. This means that the player doesn't make any choices which impact the story, making it more akin to a graphic novel than a game. While many might argue that this would make it inferior to other VNs, the story is well written and satisfying enough where I am not bothered by the lack of choice. Both the artwork and the text are beautiful and bring the story to life.

So even if you don't normally play kinetic novels, I highly recommend you buy it anyways and try it for yourself. There's a reason Key/VisualArt's is as well known for their VNs as they are (hint: it's because they're geniuses). By buying this game, you are supporting Key/VisualArt's, Sekai Project, and Steam, which in turn will lead to more VNs being released on Steam! It's a quadruple win!

And thank you Sekai Project for collaborating with Key/VisualArt's to make this happen. Can't wait for Clannad!

- Some levels can be a bit laggy on low end devices
- Can get quite annoying
- Somewhat repetitive

...But overall; considering the price and the quality of the game itself, it's a great game!",True
"One of the best games I'll ever play. Extremely gripping storyline, amazing puzzles which can take a while to solve. It had me so attached to it, with all the characters and tests, the voicelines and mystery. It includes past and futuristic elements, with many plot twists and exciting moments. After finishing the first and second game, I felt so empty inside that I went and bought the book, and every portal related game on steam. Cheers to everyone who is thinking of buying this. Go for it.",True
very interesting game,True
Best game on steam since 2006.,True
"Legend of Grimrock is a solid old-school rpg game for rpg fans, nostalgia seekers, and gamers that wish to flex their creative muscles. 

The main story is about a band of 4 criminals who have commited treasonous crimes, and those crimes will only be pardoned if  they survive mount grimrock, a aincient nordic-looking cave atop a high moutain. The game sticks to its classic roots. There is a smooth and simple skill tree, races (that dont play too much of a part), and plenty of suprises and new foes to keep the game intresting. The game also supports Steam's workshop, to share and try out new dungeons. I had lots of fun scanning stone temple walls for hidden buttons, finding out new puzzles, such as a pressure plate that needs to be weighed down with a rock, in order to pass through.

Overall, I would recommend this game to alot of my friends, but the old-school genre isn't for everyone. If you are used to a game such as Dark Souls II or the Elder Scrolls V, this may not be for you.

My rating 8.5 / 10

Keeps you coming back for more!

"Full disclosure: A pretty good chunk of my hours on this game were from leaving it on while I took a break from the computer for a while, but rest assured I've still played it six times and am about to sit down for playthrough #7.

This is one of those games that you want to play for the first time all over again, and it actually makes me a little upset that I can't. I remember expecting it to be a good game, just another good game, when I first picked it up, and it turned out to be one of the deepest experiences I've ever had, as well as one of the only games I make a point of replaying over and over again.",True
really awesome ww2 game that is both Imersive and authentic. The guns have a real authority to them and the sounds are good with the real sound mod. Never have an issue getting a game,True
"great game, not the best in the franchise but not terrable, an ocean of content but as deep as a puddle.",True
"If you love Supergiant Games, you'll love this too.  The team has created another fully fleshed out world with great characters.  The art and music are incredible, they manage to blow me away every time.  The ball sport part of the game is pretty varried, and sometimes frustrating.  Amazing work",True
"One of the top games I played growing up. It holds up to this day, and has even improved in areas too over the prior versions, plus the new DLC adds interesting things. Pace can be a little slow in the beginning minutes but once the war ramps up you have no time to relax. AI on higher levels is very tough, probably cause it cheats, multiplayer community still exists. Great game to play with/against friends.",True
best game,True
Pretty ok!,True
This game. This damn game was it. This was the best damn game for WW2 ever and ever will be. Playing on Authentic was hell but was it fun I can't believe I actually beat it. Seeing Allen and Garnet dead when you ran around the hedge with Leggat crying holy my heart hurt. Damn fine job men. Damn fine JOB!,True
"Wow! Those Spacestages are very annoying.

I was trying to not bump into those floating stuff and then I am trying to grab something with those glitchy hands and then it floats away and 1 hour is wasted.

What pisses me off, is if this tool floats away, it comes from the edge again and flies in front of my face away, like this tool is saying: ""F*ck you!"" and give me the middle finger.

So no, I don't like this game very much for making that kind of frustrating experiences.",False
Decent game,True
"Unfortunately, this doesn't really qualify as a game.  After two hours of gameplay, all that can be said it is a mildly interactive movie.  Although it bears a graphical resemblance to Minecraft, it completely misses the mark on what the fans were looking for: Minecraft with more purpose.  Very disappointing.",False
"Decent game with a decent start. Needs work, but that's happening. 

Most early access games I've played are riddled with bugs. I didn't notice any in my single player play through.

I look forward to see how this game progresses.",True
It’s very fun and it has a good story and there’s about an endless amount of hours worth of content and with mods there’s even more. I would strongly recommend it especially for the price.,True
"The game:
Amazing, fantastic soundtrack. The characters are funny and well rounded. Every minute makes you feel like you are a true Compton gangster. Theres so much to explore, the weapons are fun and the minigames add a bit of fun to the chaos.

The port:
Awful. Crashes every time a car explodes. Crashes when a mission is completed the wrong way. Crashes because it wants to crash. This is clearly not optimized for PC. And after 14 hours playing, Im not even halfway to the end of the story. The minigames always have bugs or glitches. example: The low rider mission has the controls switched. So I hope you have a good memory.

tldr, torrent it like a normal person or just play it on PS2. This copy is a waste of time and energy",False
"The game is great, although it was created long ago!",True
"A very accurate, space physics simulator. The release of career mode allows me to space race with my friends. Overall, a very good game that I would highly recomend to anyone.",True
"This game is good because so many people play it and its online, only thing is that theres no spooky month items on the workshop.",True
It's just stupid fun. From the most beginner of players through those on the hardest difficulties.,True
gg,True
Nice Battle Royale Game❤️,True
"This is, in my opinion, the closest thing to a perfect competitive game. The skill curve is extremely steep, so you will see yourself improving very rapidly for hundreds of hours. The skill ceiling is so insanely high that pro players are still significantly improving years after the game's original release. The meta shifts not because of changes to the engine (which essentially never happen) but because the pros have room for improvement even in the static environment. This makes for a truly special experience that gets more fun as you get better.",True
"Only buy if you have friends to play with. If you have friends to play with, this is a must own party game.",True
good,True
can be very fun and time consuming as well as a great community on the right servers both PvE and PvP abit glitchy here and there but ooverall very well done game in my opinion,True
very awesome,True
yes,True
"If you love Worldwar 2 games, this is a must have. I can't believe this game was out for so long but I never gave it a chance. But I enjoyed my experience playing it. Its a must have!",True
My only gripe with this game is that it should have been longer. It's a deep engaging story with a slice of life very chill. It's worth picking up.,True
A perfect game for the casual gamer. You gonna understand all game mechanics in the first hour but you will try to bring them to perfection till the last mission.,True
Best game,True
Very beautiful and relaxing,True
"A fun little compettative experience where betreyal is the name of the game and you better start playing, lest your humanity is stolen by gabe newell",True
"I bought this game in 2018, took a 2+ year break and finished in 2020...the storyline was pretty good, definitely unique and kept me interested despite the gap. The graphics are well done, although mainly 256 shades of gray but the lighting was excellent and kept the atmosphere alive. The sound was excellent, it was immersive and surround effects were fantastic. Only real complaint was the illogical, borderline frustrating puzzles and repetitive running to one end of map to get a key just to run to the other end to open a door so I could run back again to get item X to run back yet again, etc...you get bored seeing the same rooms and pathways. No real ultrawide support, I had black bars on the sides at 3440x1440  but it wasn't distracting.

System usage, expect about 8-10GB VRAM used on max settings, light multicore CPU and system memory usage.   

Likes: Creepy atmosphere, smooth and detailed graphics, well designed surround sound, unique storyline, HDR implementation was effective.

Dislikes: Many puzzles and exploration/quest items are borderline illogical. Had to resort to a walk-through guide about 40% of the way in. Got sick of running back and forth 3 dozen times.",True
Its bologna,True
im hungry,True
Outstanding tactical gameplay along with the Ironman mode made for a terrific gaming experience.,True
I had so much fun playing through the game and discovering the fates of the various crew,True
Im sorry but this game requires too many people and too much time. I simply would not reccomend you buy this game. The Company that made this game clearly did not learn anything from previous games.,False
"Love it.
Edit: Still love it!",True
