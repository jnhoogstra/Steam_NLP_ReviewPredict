"Wide spread crashes on Nvidia grpahics cards and amateur hour with relying on too many external resources that are not packed with the game. Should have been caught in even the most basic of QA(A field I've actually worked in). Early access is not a substitute for QA. That's how you get bad reviews like this one.

 The error window(on a side note) is also amusingly incapable of supporting copy paste functions, which is a problem since the crash on start up, that they have created a sticky for, is about half of my 24"" monitor's screen.

 My recommendation is no until they get their things together. Heavily considering a refund.",False

"Fun and easy to pick up board game like RPG.  Only a few hours in and wanting more, if time allowed.  I like games that allow me the option to charge ahead or grind when I feel like it, and this game does.  You can repeat dungeons to get crafting material to make items, but I never felt the need to, sometimes I just did it to do it.  My only complaint thus far is the when picking your skill enhancements I didn't really ""feel"" the effect so much in game.  A few more options would be nice too, but they are small things and wouldn't deter me from recommending game at all.",True

really awesome game! i love it,True
"Good for sandbox builders (nice customisation in builds and resource gathering is not to tedious), enough challenge if you feel like a more action style game (upgraded weapon system isn't clunky, mutants are varying levels of challenge).

"This game has a great lore with many game mechanics that basically makes it an strategy mmorpg mixture. However if you are into Rome 2/Medieval/Attila style Total War games, this is not for you. Optimization is also on a high point compared to previous Total War titles. I rate this game 9/10.

"If you enjoyed the first Hand of Fate, I can almost promise you will love this one. The combat system has improved, but still has that Warner Brothers combat style. There are so many more boards to choose from than the previous game. More variety of weapons and rewards combos. The dealer still has amazing voice acting. The cards and stories are even more developed. There are more ways to determine your path other than the card shuffle. 
Although the combat is improved, it can still feel a little clunky at times. There also seems to be some typos in the game, but I'm sure those will be patched out. That is really the only negatives I have about this game. New to the series or regular, you will enjoy this game if you like an RNG rogue like board game where you do the combat and story telling yourself.",True

Still the best in the series!",True

"永遠消失的幻想鄉 ～ The Disappearing of Gensokyo is an excellent Touhou doujin top down shooter,here's what i liked about it.

-The game looks great,it's graphics are really good,especially considering it's a doujin/indie title.

-There are a ton of playable characters,each with a fully fleshed out danmaku skillset and bring a lot of variety to compliment the game's solid gameplay.

-The dialogues are extremely funny,especially after the patch that fixed the errors in the translation and also are consistent with the lore of the Touhou universe.

-The campaign is big and offers a wide variety of locations and missions.

The music is very good,as one can expect form a Touhou game.",True
"This game feels like the perfect representation of what you would expect from a martial art action game. Few have even come close to getting such an authentic feel to it. 

Though lacking a bit in story, I don't feel that is the point of this game.

All games aim to be good in all catagories; but I believe this one aims to perfect a single element; hand to hand combat mechanics. And how it aims toward this is done to almost perfection.

If you looking for a long and detailed story, this game is probably not for you; but if you are like me and have been waiting for a game that focuses and perfects combat mechanics, I think you will love it.

For what this game is aiming to be, total 10/10 from me.",True

"Recently I bought my first dual stick controller and I've been buying games to play with it. GM:RE and GM3:DE were some of the first games I encountered looking for twin stick shooters. I started with GM:RE. At first I was a bit disappointed it was just one gamemode inside a rectangular arena, but after 2 or 3 games I was hooked! The visuals are stunning and the gameplay is fun and challenging.

A dual stick controller works great but a Move Navigation Controller in combination with a mouse works even better. You do need to change the aim method for the mouse to see where you're aiming at.

Shortly after getting GM:RE I bought GM3:DE as well. GM3:DE has more to offer but I don't regret buying both.",True
"Sooo fun to play and the story is very good to me. I like to explore all over and find new things like this one time a found a bar in a cave, they did not like me and i killed all of them.

"Anomaly: Warzone Earth is a reverse tower defense game. What does that mean? Well, you aren't defending, but you play as attacker. You can build a squad with up to 6 vehicles. Later in the game you also have 6 different types of vehicles you can choose from. The defender also have different towers (normal, aoe etc.) and you can set different routes so that you can avoid certain areas (with many towers). You can also control a commander and he's incredible important as he can repair you vehicles, throw smoke or decoy grenades and even nuke towers. Even after the story mode (4-5 hours long) you can still play some challenging levels.

"Judging Victoria 2 is hard. However, the reason why I don't recommend it, is fundamentally because it's not a videogame. It is sold as a videogame, but truth be told, it's a hobby. What makes Victoria 2 a hobby is the fact that learning how ""the game"" works is a tedious, boring task, in which you have to search the internet for wikis, youtube videos and documentation. If Victoria 2 was sold as a hobby it would have to compete with other hobbys, not with other videogames. And as a hobby it's actually fun. But as a game it has to compete with games that make learning the complexity of the game itself much more fun, like mobas, card games and 4x strategy games. Victoria 2 doesn't even have a victory condition... because ""winning"" doesn't matter in a hobby. 
Another criticism is the fact that the base Victoria 2 that I've purchased doesn't come with all the patches. To get tha patches you have to purchase the DLSs... and the documentation you find online mostly refers to the patched Victoria 2, making this an even worse proposition. 
Evaluate Victoria 2 as a hobby, not as a game.",False
"It’s really good! I’m quite shocked how revised it is. The original had some endearing characteristics about it, but it was also really janky. The AI was overly sensitive and when aggro’d they knew where you exactly were 100% of the time, they were deadshots, and when one guy knew where you were everyone become aware. It made things like the war on the bridge a goddamn nightmare.  And while some parts of the graphics engine were nice, it also looked off in that sort of way you recognize in games east of the Czech Republic. To see that they redid the AI, encounters, and graphics to bring it up to par with the more mainstream assessable Last Light is pretty great. Hell, with it’s story and conclusion it’s even a better game than Last Light.

So if you’re curious about the series, definitely try out Metro 2033 Redux.",True

rdm is what i do,True
5yr old game and still overpriced. Not to mention the list of dlc which accumulates to over $300. And thats US dollars. It would cost me over $400 and simply not worth the money. Not even quarter of that. Yep over 300US for a 5yr old game and locked and required dlcs for the base game as its base game has been tampered with and requires dlc. Typical cash grab tactics by devs. Game was fun at the start but Paradox Int games are basically all the same mechanics. Very little goes in develping the same game mechanics. Just a turd dressed up in a different bag. Devs just copy/paste everything these days when they release new stripped titles yet charge the max price and throw in dlcs which should be part of the main game. Paradox Int are right up there with the rest of devs that practice this marketing crap.,False

"Killing Floor is one of my all-time favorite co-op FPS's. The game is structured extremely well towards helping out your teammates, almost but not quite to the point that it punishes you for playing solo. I will say that I've never managed to beat even the easiest possible game solo, so online co-op is pretty much the only way to go. Luckily, the game has a large community following, even after the release of the sequel, so it shouldn't be too hard to find a good game. The different perks and many available weapons offer a lot of versatility in available ways to slaughter the zeds, although some of the perks are unfairly difficult to level up (I'm looking at you, commando).

Definitely recommended!

EDIT: Many years later, I have managed to beat several games solo, at hard difficulty (but not nightmare). I've gotten better! :D",True
"I have been a huge fan of the series, so much so that I preordered this game (which I dont usually do). That was a huge mistake. The graphics looks like they are from 2003.

"When I seen the trailer for this game, I was curious about it from the get go. SImple graphics, and not much in the way of game control. But once I started up the game, I was amazed at how easy it pulls you into playing. The play style, is fun and addictive. The rush of the wind that you hear in your ears. Makes you feel like you are actually free flying. And when you dip down to pick up speed, it's like wow listen to the wind rush by. And when you pull in close to the cliffs you get a rush, waiting to see what is around the next corner. 
 What is surprising to, is you can loop all day around one small mountain range. Or dip and find out what is lower, or look for portals to take you to new areas. And find something new to fly around...
 For a simple game, it has what feels like a lot of depth. Props to the devs for such a unique game... And being able to generate more maps is a big plus, and with the ability to share them is amazing. Sadly there is no co-op mode, so you can't loop around and in to areas with other friends. 
 Plugging in my Xbox 360 controller, was no prob. It worked right off the hop (as I play other games with my controller).
 If your looking for a simple game, that is relaxing with some nice feel for a rush in places. then this is the game. No intense gun fights. But unique way for exploring a area.",True

I got it at a 90% discount because I had a coupon from crafting a badge on Steam.

You get various routes to follow and it does take some strategy to get the achievements and the right choices via selective saving (which makes it fun). Plus, it really isn't as dark as some otome games as mentioned in another review and that's really a pro.

It's really fun and when you speed through the dialogue because you screwed up a choice and want to redo it, it actually goes fast. Plus the characters are real cute.",True

"Now i do recommend this game for many reasons however there is a few things i would love to see added to it [yes i know it is in early access] 
Pros 
Awesome Physics [breaking stuff] 
Not many limts on what you can build 
Optimized better then space engineers 
Graphics are good 
Blueprints 
Controls 

Improvements needed 
Trading Cards [ i dont know if they are going to add them after early access]
[Not sure if this is possable to do] But collections that can be for both games [space and medieval engineers]  [this could be valves side so ignore this one]
Mods that can be made in game [Slightly like gmod] but like new blocks maybe a smeltery Where you make some  or something to the effect

Overall 
I would give this game a 9.8/10 because it has a lot of pros but still has little things that i think should be added
you should defently get it even when it is full price it is worth it

"First off, I would just like to say I like the direction this game is headed. Yeah yeah, I know its Early Access and all, but for the  major things to still be broken, yet devs are adding christmas themes to things doesnt make sense. Wagon still not fixed, handle flays all over, taking 5 minutes to grab. Ore gets stuck in the chimney and no matter how hard you fan nothing will come out. I made successful swords in the past and all of the sudden after i restarted the game (only because I couldnt get another pickaxe) I could only get one successful swing in per iron ore. On the note of the pickaxe, yes I know where its supposed to spawn and no it doesnt spawn there. Everything is fine until you leave the game and come back in the next day. Once again I like the way its headed, but these major things that are crucial to the base gameplay have got to get fixed for me to continue playing. Best of luck.",False

"I want to love this game.  I love turn/semi-turn based tactical shooters/RPG's.  (and have been playing them since ones like Xcom and MOM, or even the 'Gold Box' series for the C-64 were originally released).

It's a great concept/start.  And while the same ~9 male or female faces, and running around to various cities asking tons of people the same questions does get tiring - I am more than willing to forgive those little things.

You REALLY need to add the community mods (Blue Sun Mods, SilverGirls mods - Thanks SG & Thrillseeker)- which add a LOT.  But, imho, they can't overcome the insane inconsistent game mechanics.

The cameara will drive you insane.  Regardless of the events settings.  No matter how you set the camera settings - you will be moving the camera around manually a LOT (especially elevation).  And you will find that the game will not always move the camera to the appropriate character - even if you have that enabled.  I can't count how many times I've lost someone because they were waiting for someone to enter their view (it's even happened to two characters with one standing behind one kneeling), but were shot by someone in plain sight (and we're talking 5 feet in front of them) because the camera never moved to them or the game selected them.  (and yes - those were set in the settings.)  And trying to view/move into buildings is insane.  You have to get them into a doorway (and if they pause - you're dead) or zoom down incredibly close which then looses area 'context'.  (If you can even do, because the camera won't 'back up' past the edge of the battle field...)

Then there's the 'action'.  Or attempting to figure out how to consistenly 'pause' the action when required.  You invariably screw yourself because you go to pause, only to unpause it becuase the game just paused it before you tried to pause it.  (Get it?)  And, you tried to pause it because one of your characters was in 'no action' mode so that you could have another character do something else first, but the moment was lost because the game autmatically started the action again once you assigned a task to the first character. (And, seriously, every little millisecond in this games MATTERS) There should at least be an option to let you either UNPAUSE automatically - or manually.  (Like after you've assigned orders to ALL non-active allies).

And then ther's the issue of the computer constantly 'cheating'.  Like ALWAYS being able to position characters PERFECTLY around corners/doorways so that you can't hit them (trying to do the exact same thing) while they smoke your people.  (And there is a 'jump-areound-the-corner', shoot, and move back, but you REALLY need to micromange camera and time for that character, and it usually doesn't work anyway, because when you pop around they get shots off before you do, or because it decides to have your chaaracter face a completely different direction than the previous one, or two, or...  And because your character HAS to turn to face before they START to shoot, well, you're dead.

Other irritating items:
Characters will die after being notifed that they were only shocked (no damage), or sustained very little damage (head, with helmets) or otherwise.  Have seen no damage hits to heads (with helmets) kill characters many times.

Characters could be in the middle of throwing a grenade when a NPC gets near them, tries to pass, etc., and the player character will stop whatever they are doing to move (""pardon me miss, I was just trying to kill the bad guy""...)  AND, sometimes they move back (and you MIGHT be able to stop it).  And sometimes they don't.

You will select Snap Shot for speed, and it does an Aimed shot anyway.  Or you select Aimed - but then you can't aim. (And I am talking about tens of times from the exact same save point - not different circumstances).

Allies cannot shoot (even when barrel shows it extends past) or throw objects through walls.  Enemies can.  (Even when they are far away from it).

Or, you're in a crouched position, and you can't stand.  (Like, behind a bar counter, which you need to - to be able to shoot the bad guys, but thery're blasting your head away meanwhile...)

Forget trying to get past the Top Secret mission.  It will take you hours and hundreds of attempts.  (In a bar with 'innocents, and the enemy can get off 10 shots for each one of yours.  You can even trow grenades from behind the bar (ducked down) without those characters getting picked off - or the grenades going everywhere else, yadda...  (I still haven't - and have tried all kinds of ideas, including shooting/grenading first, trying to lead out of the bar, yadda...)

And while you can get it at an excellent price, I believe there are other similar games at the same price point that aren't anywhere near as frustrating.

This game does have the potential to be an awesome one.  But it needs some serious work.  Save your money.  And your time.  And your sanity.  Especially 'casual' gamers.",False

"I really love how Accidental Queen made a lot of games that related to most of the social issues that people find it difficult to share and choose to hide. By making it an interactive game, it really sends its meaning and messages very well to the players. It made players to think twice and reflect upon one's experiences such as Laura's. 

We definitely need more of this kind of games to allow people to be more aware such circumstances do exist in many societies and it definitely in need of helps. It also create an awareness for people to realize that THERE IS NOTHING TO BE ASHAME OF in asking for help when you facing such a situation.

"To be honest there is only a little replay value, but saying that I did play through the game three times.  The problem is that your choices have a very small impact in how the other characters treat you.  The third time I played I saw almost exactly the same things as the first two, (except for some failure moments) and the story goes on whether you choose option 1 or 4.  

Despite some gameplay woes listed above I would like to point out that I enjoyed learning about some history and especialy liked how we are taken along for the journy in a front seat view.  The first run was the best for even though I found myself having a little trouble manuvering the character I learned a lot and had fun doing so.

As soon as I saw it on Steam I forked over the cash, hoping it would be good.

It's almost perfectly identical, minus Luck Stones. I do NOT miss those. Even the control scheme is the same, which for me is part of the charm.

Being able to seamlessly switch between enhanced and retro mode is a very cool feature.
And they keep adding cool stuff!

- There is only one reticle for medium-long sights and it's barely even visible in the dark.
- Medium sights are a joke, that's not even 2x magnification.
- Only one reticle (red dot) for all no magnification sights, but the 553 and the other Eotech, both have that circle+cross reticle.
- No VoIP
- No comms wheel
- Loadouts doesn't save and they take a hell of a time to customize again.
But these are also ""ok"" things that you often see when playing EA games.

Now here comes the dumb part, the part where all the devs in the world should already know after decades of gaming industry, after Battelfield, ARMA, CoD and aaaaaall those large scale FPS wins and fails. The things that should never came out with the release of the game (yeah guys, EA is a f****** release, it may not be finished, but it should be playable and you are paying for it, if devs want to test CORE things work with closed or open betas).

- You can't really choose a map, since every time I tried to pick one it started looking for players 1/32 ot 1/64, only quick match works.
- Hit registration and sync are waaaaaaaaaaay of, you can see that when trying to snipe.
- Spawn camping is a thing since you aways spawn in the same point when you select a location. What? Really? Not even a respawn inv timer? And people are already realising that and breaking the game.
- BASE CAMPING IS ALSO A THING, DUDE! 2018! WE ALREADY PLAYED 12931284 BATTLEFIELD GAMES and you didn't deal with it? Even DICE got it fixed for BFV for F***'s sake.
- Try respawning on your Squad Leader? Get pushed off the map
- If players gets disconnected or leave the game they are not replaced, or it seems like, since I can almost aways see a 5 players difference between both teams
- The weight system, that sould be the limiter and definer of ""classes"" is broken, you can go full TOP helmet and plate and still carry a fully loaded sniper rifle and LMG and you can move around the map just fine, just s tinny bit slower than a medium weight player, but it makes no difference, a light weight player would be fast as hell but weak as fuck and would have to relly on SMG + pistols and the TTK for those are broken within the game. Other than that the weight system does nothing more. Same ammount of ammo, same ammount of nades, no stamina system, same recoil control, same everything.
- FPS starts dropping after 2-3 maps and you have to restart the game ZZZZZzzzzzzzzzz

But the main things are the spawn and base camping, lol, it's getting boring already. It's already that situation when every match your or the other team camps spawns and bases and the cornered team starts leaving the match and you end up with a 16 vs 2 battle.

"This game is incredibly fun and is easily worth its small price. The single player experience is too easy, but the community and diverse maps more than make up for it. As long as I'm connected to the internet, Pavlov is probably my favorite VR game.

*Edit- Pavlov just raised ~$10, so it's not super cheap anymore, but it still is my favorite VR game in my library. (I kind of want to know if getting Onward is a good idea. It'd be pretty epic if someone told me if I should go for it)

*Edit 2- Pavlov gun handling is conclusively much better than Onward. Single player just got plenty harder with the inclusion of the Hunt game mode, and zombies is pretty fun, too.",True

"I've been wanting to play this game since 6 years ago, and finally I got a copy of it. 

For 2009's game, Velvet Assassin already have all the basic stealth action game needs: sound, light and shadow detection, (limited) evirontment and tools utilization, enemy manipulation, and most important among them are all of those stealth kills. It also offers gunfights in some occassion, which my noob skill in FPS game like Counter Strike turns out to be very helpful. Because, suprisingly, this game gives you the ability to do instant kill with headshot and recoils control. Like playing CS games, all you need to do is just tweak your mouse sensitivity, aim right, and learn each weapon's recoils. 

The graphic and sound in this game are pretty good for its time. Especially for the ambient sound and music. It almost sound like early Silent Hill games. 

As for storyline department, Velvet Assassin have a non-linear plot, with no multiple choices/endings, and often went fastforward to a different timeline. This non-linear plot makes the game a bit confusing at the begining. But if you keep following the story, at the turning point event everything that has happen will be explained (including her dress(?) and those srynges, maybe?). It's just... there is one thing that seems breaking that good storyline. The ending. Somehow it feels like it has been chopped out. It doesn't have a strong conclusion for a solid ending nor a cliffhanger. It's like, it still have a little more things to tell before the game ends. It's not a bad ending, though. It's just seem not quite completed yet.

Well, overall the game is quite fun. I recommend Velvet Assassin because I like this game. It may not suitable for most gamer, but if you okay with the theme (really, It does have quite strong themes and there are srynges too, I warned you! XD) and doesn't expecting any fancy acrobatic or hi-tech stealth moves, then this game might worth your time. 

PS: This is an old game. It may give some troubles with newer hardwares or operating system. You may need to look for some instructions on how to install this game on your PC before having it in your steam library. And I played this game offline, so 1 hour gameplay record on this review is not the actual time.",True

"Despite the controller disclaimer, I did play this game with a keyboard.  It didn't take long to get used to the dual movements, but there did seem to be a few glitches.  For example one brother would get locked in one direction until releasing all buttons or only one brother would move at a time.  Not game breaking and just minor annoyances, so if you can live with that a keyboard is just fine, otherwise, yes, use a controller as advised.  Also, the characters speak an unknown fantasy language very similar to 'The Sims' games, so do not try to adjust the language settings!  The story is conveyed in a surpurb way through facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice; I had no problem keeping up with what was going on.  The game is gorgeous with stunning visuals and it is obvious a lot of attention and detail was given by the developers.  Even better than the graphics, though, is how emotionally involved the game is.  There are highs, lows, and thrilling adventure.  I was enraptured by the entire story.  Even though the whole game only takes maybe 4 hours with careful attention, it is well worth every cent spent on it.  I found some of the achievements to be a little silly, since they were ridiculously subtle or obscure, but that is a very minor negative.  Bottom line, you must give this game a chance.",True

"With what's already here, it beats a great deal of the stuff on Steam.  I have encountered a few bugs, but nothing that the team can't handle before launch.  Namely the teleporters in both single and multiplayer at the end of every level.  Sometimes in single player the teleporter won't spawn.  In multiplayer, however, I have had an issue where the teleporter is visible for one person but not the other.  If you played the first game, then you'll transition pretty seamlessly into this one.  The music lives up to the last game (which is honestly why I was so excited for this to come out).

"For a 2-man indie development team, one would not think that SPAZ could amount to much. Anyone thinking this: Boy were you wrong. SPAZ is a top-down, 2-D space-based shooter that combine RPG, RTS and some two-point elements to combine into a great, trully awesome game.

At the time of writing this I have not beat it yet, but I have however sunk over 70 hours into it and really enjoyed myself. The game provides a plot and a purpose to strive for, but you get to chose how you get there. What ships you use, how you equip them, what tactics you employ, where you go, who you befriend/betray/fight, it's all up to you.

So the best way to start this review is to say I am not sure why this game is getting so much hate. I think this is a great improvement compared to fallout 3. The story is SO SO SO much better from Fallout 3 (which isnt saying much because I dont think i have ever been put to sleep by a story as much as I did by Fallout 3). The customization is so much better. I can actually make characters look like me now. The weapons can be modified. The Power Armor is now like a juggernaut suit which i feel is a much better idea. I like the star idea for perks better than the select individual perks. There are some things that could use improvement such as dialog choices but you cant truly expect a perfect game now can you? Overall this game is SO worth the 60 dollars ESPECIALLY if you are a Fallout fan,True

"played all thief games, this one is particular because its made by different persons, but lets be clear, they made an outstanding job honestly there's tons a few things that lets you immerse yourself into the univers. You want to turn off every single HUD informations? Allright, there's no need for them much more since they created the game including in games feedback. You want something immersive? Okay let's show the character hang on every corner he touches. Also there's wrong complains about the freedom level design,  first we have to consider making a game during thief 2 period and the current one are two major different things, then from this statement, lets talk about what they achieve compared to what we are use to deal with in actual time, there's no shame to get face games like Dishonored, some of the places provides enough space to let you sneak into your objective the way you want. Once again, it feels organic, that's the major point I want to make clear about. And another huge quality, the visuals and the art design, dont make mistakes on it, its not a game from 2014 its completly a gorgeous current game, nobody could play the game maxed out as we do now with gtx1070 kind graphic cards, so just give it a try now, turn off every single HUD options, trust me it should be an unforgettable journey into that dark london version of victorian period.

You can also get a decent amount of weapons along with secondary weapons and several add-ons. The story is pretty cheesy but it does have some fun dialogue at times. It's not very long but it does have a New Game Plus mode, however it doesn't allow much for sequence breaking since most of the areas require keycards to get to rather than using your skills.

"A throwback to the 80s where cyborgs, aliens, lasers and mutated beings were the norm…or at least we thought there were…You are a Cyber Commando and your mission is: To Save the World. An over-the-top FPS shooter with great soundtracks and a cyberpunk setting. Quite the reminisce if you ask me. 

[b]Graphics: 9/10[/b]
Straight out from what the future would’ve looked like if you were imagining it from the 1980s. Neon lights, multicolour lasers and robotic arms are seen throughout the entire game. Some might even say they are too bright. 

[b]Storyline: 7/10[/b]
It’s a very simple – “get the girl and save the world because you’re the only one who can do it!”. I guess it’s the 1980s and this would be the norm, but it just seemed a bit too generic for me really; they should’ve tried something more unique as with sticking with the original theme. Nonetheless, the game will feed you a ton of 80s references and over the top comedy that will keep you entertained for the rest of the game. 

[b]Sound: 10/10[/b]
Do I even need to say anything here?? I mean it’s just pure awesomeness with everything about the soundtracks. Especially the voice acting and the minigun sound…they are so satisfying to hear. 

[b]Gameplay: 8/10[/b]
You either go in quiet and unnoticed or just go in full metal mode and barge in the room with your shotgun, it’s up to you. You’ll have fun either way. The weaponry, the enemies and the vehicles are well refined to have an enjoyable gameplay. The only downsides are the random frame drops when the game AutoSaves and it requires Uplay for you to be able to play. 

[b]Price: 6/10[/b]
Asking for £11.99 is a bit too much for the amount of time you can complete this game (around 6-8 hours), it’s not worth the ‘pound per hour’ if you’re wondering that. But it is certainly worth getting when it goes on a sale. Then I’d totally recommend it.

Probably the best Sims game.  I have not upgraded to Sims 4 and am not anxiously awaiting Sims 5.  The folks that contribute to this game with mods have really kept this game alive and attractive.  I don't have all the DLCs and think that one should be selective and prudent as to which ones to purchase.  Some are great and some are definitely only a money grab.  No problem in connection with the outside source from Steam.,True

"7 Wonders: Ancient Alien Makeover will satisfy Steam users looking to play a newer version of 7 Wonders with slick graphics, smooth gameplay and finally achievements to obtain.  If you've played any of the 7 Wonders ""match three"" type games before then you will want to pick up this title.  7 Wonders games are great casual titles and consistently the best of the ""match three"" genre.  I wish the developers would add achievements to older 7 Wonders games and re-release them on Steam. I found Ancient Alien Makeover to be a bit easier compared to previous titles but outstanding with it's improvement on visuals, minigames and powerups.

If you're feeling spicy, however, you can turn off historical AI and who knows, it might be Communist Luxembourg invading the entire world instead of Nazi Germany. I had a wonderful experience with this app, even when you've completed the original game twice, you can go onto steam workshops and mod the game for even better experiences.  I'd like to conclude that this is a great WWII simulation/strategy game, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in WWII.",True

"[h1]Best Co-op experience I've had in the last 11 years[/h1]



I first bought this game back when it released in EA and it was good at the time. I ended up returning after about an hour of play because I felt it wasn't filled with enough content. I've been hesitant about buying new games since I have had my horrible handful of EA games. 

but

 I saw it pop on the store again last week released as a full game. I gave another shot at it and damn. 

[b][i]I DO NOT REGRET IT.[/i][/b]

(no regerts)

Anyways.

I play with my buddy as none of my other friends think ""this is their style of game"" yet once they saw me live streaming it they quickly changed their mind about it. They all picked up the game and have been hooked.

At first I was worried i wouldn't have any friends to play the game with but the developers added in this beautiful thing called an intelligent companion. You can tell bosco what to do and it knows what to do. It's beautiful I've never had such an intelligent AI partner in any game. [spoiler]Looking at you skyrim[/spoiler] No but seriously, this boi is the real deal. He will mine for you, help you fight hordes, revive you, protect you, and more. 



So let's talk about what exactly I like about the game.

[b]Every single mission is different, I mean every single thing.[/b]

   - Everytime we go on a mission we see a different enemy, cave formation, or weird encounter. Never once was I left with a bad taste in my mouth.

[b]Put on that souls like difficulty.[/b]

   -  You can change the difficulty on the fly with whatever mission you want, and there are even ones with random factors that change how the mission operates.

[b]Customization[/b]

   - Wanna be a black dwarf with a blonde beard? Wanna be a white dwarf with a black beard? Wanna wear a skull cap with futuristic armor? Want weapon skins that you don't have to pay for? Want armor skins you earn through gameplay? Perks? Weapon perks? Pickaxe customization? YOU CAN EVEN CUSTOMIZE BOSCO

[b]Friends.[/b]

   - Don't have to say much for this... you can play with all your friends or find new ones in their matchmaking.

[b]Beer[/b]

   -Gives you them good buffs

[b]Photomode[/b]

    - If you have an RTX card you have a awesome photomode for taking pictures!

[b]Mission Control[/b]

    - Mission control is operated by some random dwarf who I haven't yet learned the name of but that's not what is important here. What is important is that he is always involved in all the missions. Giving you helpful advice, pointers, or just outright saying some funny lines. It's not intrusive and it's done in a really good matter.

[b] Settings menu[/b]

     - I love when developers put a nice settings menu in the game. It has all that you need.




Alright stuff I don't like about the game

[b]Literally my only gripe with this game is that explosions do not do enough damage to the caves. That's it.[/b]



So after you've read all this, you are asking should I get it?

[i]The answer is yes. Get the fucking game. Right fucking now.[/i]

 It's worth all $30.
I do a system that a game is defined by how many hours I put it in it 1 hour = $2.

"Unless youve already sunk a decent amount of hour in this game stop, horrible hitboxes and local match hosting makes lag a nightmare not to mention the fact the game receives a single update every three months and a ""mid chapter update"" to correct all the things they managed to fuck up in the prior three months, the meta game has been stale as shit the games entire life since only ten or so perks (probably less) are even acknowledged as good by the communities majority and the other sixty give or take perks are dogshit. Im sure it isnt the case but the games developers make it seem like they dont care about the game anymore seeing as how all the problems i just stated stand and as of right now theyre talking about adding a battle pass that would snake you out of even more money in a game you dont have to spend money to unlock dlc characters since you can now grind for them (which by the way is a real kick in the dick to anyone who bought them before that was an option) along the same lines as the perks half the killers are either a joke of a threat or tip beyond the point of being a treat into just sheer inescapable death. This games had the same problems for the last two years and the devs never listen to what a majority of their community tells them furthered by the point that . This game is not worth the amount of time i put into it and i genuinely regret how much time i DID spend playing it. I would actually say that 50% if not slightly more of the games you get into a lobby in will either crash or infinitely load making you lose the items you worked to get for something beyond your control, and if none of the other things i said gets this point across i hope this does: there was a character in the game literally, VERY literally EVERYONE disliked since their release, they made you sit idle for large amounts of time leaving you sitting not play the game, for four months they went unchecked constantly talked about in a negative light for four months they were left how they were even though LITERALLY everyone despised them, and after they finally announced they were changing the mechanics that no one liked, the developer that DESIGNED THAT CHARACTER said on a stream that ""he was disappointed with how they turned out BEFORE release but released anyway just to push content out"" also this game has the worst and most toxic community of any game ive played in my life",False

"I dont understand why there are so many reviews not recommending this game that have played it over 100 hours,, must be really crap if im going to spend 100+ hours... 

COME ON,, LETS BE SERIOUS!!! 

Its a great game,, yes it would have been awesome to get more of the content free, but we only got 5 races,, each with their own lords and play styles and each with atleast 15 to 20 hours of gameplay,, i.e. 75 to 100 hours of gameplay easily (and thats not including MODs, or multiplayer). I have 352 hrs as of writing this review,,, 

If i you divide the price by the hours of gameplay your at 80cents to 60 cents per hour. Im currently at 27c per hour and i have bought wood elves and beastmen expansion packs... 

While there are some truely amazing games like Terraria or skyrim that can consume huge amounts of time for a small price, great value games are rare! Most games get an average of 15 to 30 hours of gameplay before they are discarded for the next new thing. Most games will be lucky to get $1/hour of entertainment value. 

At $1 per hour of entertainment, the only thing cheaper that i can think of is reading a book. So think twice before listening to a ""not recommended"" review. 

Personally,, im happy to keep buying the content if it means they keep producing more of the same quality. I can't wait for the sequel and will pre-order it as soon as i can!!

And it has some decent value to replay (maybe over and over like an obsessive maniac), but I would say that for a less dedicated person the game might take like 2-3 hours per route (some might say that there are only 4 routes, guess what. They're wrong).

My judgement would be that if you have even the slightest intrest in VNs in generall it's a good enough game to start out with. And a must have for a fan of the genre. A true baby of love from the devs.

- This game cant be compared to CIV5. Both games have their own strength and weaknesses. 

Its fantasy, that is very obvious. Im not into fantasy at all. I cant enjoy the different species, the way they look, behave or smell(?). All personal preferences but important if you dont have any affinity with Fantasy. 
Beyond the fantasy concept, there are the graphics. The map looks cartonish, which you like or not. The unit graphics are rendered pretty okay, although i miss some anti alising detail here and there. 
The UI is very nicely done. The info screens are awesome and that is what this game excels in: depth. The gameplay is visible deep. You can micromanagement you hero up on the boots it has to wear. In the beginning is seems like a uncontrolable task but once you see the connection it all falls into place. The overviews are a bless and that is the pure strength of this game: the playable layers you are able to control in your own land, city and its easy overview screens. 
The battle screen is different. Instead of fighting on the map, you fight on a battleground. This is very different and should be accounted for when considering buying this game. I have played this game 10 hours with a friend. We started two MP games which both froze after x time. The first time it was right after the start, the second time arond turn 200, about four hours later. 
That is a true turn downer for me. I like Endless Legend but i feel the game is done sloppy. I just hate it when i need to remember to save the game continuously in order to avoid a lost game because its very likely that the game ends prematurely because of freezes. The devs really need to get to work to make sure this game becomes stable. Instead of laying the resposibility of the game engine core stability at the end user telling them to install x,y,z, for hardware a,b,c, i read that Amplitude has no clue were the unstability comes from. Maybe the trouble is hidden is deep unreachable layers of code...who knows. 
And the thing i really really find VERY disturbing is that when you have to leave the game premature because of a bug, freeze or other problem you do not have any blame for you will receive the text: Cowardice, you prematurely exit the game"". That is truly disgusting! 

Its a nice game and i will play it, just like i play CIV5. Its not the question: who is the best. Its the situation were i say: i like them both and i play them both.

"171 hours in. After 6 Honor mode attempts (because playing Tactician mode is for cowards) my bro and I finally beat it. It was fun and challenging. Some combats felt abusive early on, and later in the game they got easier w/ the exception of surprise OP encounters (even if they are slightly lower leveled, chain CCing your main dude's is no beuno). After playing through the game multiple times (the farthest we got before was to Death Knight's in the mines) a lot of the story was just a press 1-fest. 

The character's choices reflecting on the Trait's page could have been done better. If each choice when interacting would show which trait it would embolden [ex. Blah blah blah (Romantic) Nah nah nah (Pragmatic)] it would have felt smoother ""meta"" building a character to have the trait features they want.

Crafting was a nightmare sometimes. Some of magical items enchanted with pixie dust just didn't work. Having to find the recipes for crafting items was... okay... but if it could be just bypassed by... idk... opening a browser tab and searching for the recipes that way... I don't really see the point in having the crafting books. 

All in all this game's mechanics are jam packed so that leaves room for abuse. We refrained from using any teleport/telekinesis heavy objects cheese. We still found other ways to cheese with spells like Drain Willpower/Rapture. Sometimes the NPC's would bug out and stand in a spot and do nothing for like 15s.

"This review is in response to devs offering 3rd installment of Free DLC out of the blue. What a pleasant surprise!

I'm reviewing the new DLC here. 

It's like an entire new campaign! The original campaign, although engaging, doesn't allow customization like the DLC Conquest does. 

I like conquest because you can customize from a menu of perks each new challenge you face.

And there are often two different paths to choose from to advance to a new tier of the challenge.

I also like the ability to re-roll maps by quitting and starting over.  RNG is at play here, because it procedurally spawns a new map each time.  And the RNG is a good thing, making or breaking your attempt. Sometimes more food, or double food,  sometimes less enemies on your expansions.   RNG is good because different clans need different conditions to expand as fast as possible. 

The variety of conquests with 8 (i think) different clans means this is actually much larger than the original campaign.  Well done Shiro games!",True

"As a dedicated Dota 2 player with over 4000 hours into that game, a dota-styled card game is perfect for me. However the launch was rough and the game was lacking many core-features. Valve listened to the community and quickly released a patch adding many important features and great changes. Artifact is similar to dota in so many ways; complex gameplay with strategic elements, different lanes, abilities, items and heroes. Gameplay is great - the effects, the music, the characters interactions with each other and the lore and voices behind the cards. 

I would say that the business model is fair, I like that you can buy the cards you want without opening a lot of packs, but also the free gamemodes that don't require you to spend any money at all. I've been playing the ""call to arms"" event-decks and won a lot, resulting in higher level, earning more cards and tickets. RNG is a factor, yes, but it also keeps the game interesting for replayability. Just like with Dota 2 the developers keep updating the game and adding awesome features and improvements. Dota 2 is one of the most balanced and fair games on the market and Artifact is moving in the same direction. 
I would highly recommend Artifact even to players that don't like MOBAS or Dota 2. Artifact is the best card game I have ever played and I'm excited to see all the upcoming patches, new cards and further improvements! As it stands Artifact is a great game, but could be further improved by adding more cards, more hero colours and some stats to the player profile. I am sure that Valve will pull this off as they have already made many positive changes in only a few weeks time.",True

"It seems fine the first hours, but the game really lacks something. Some game design decisions seem questionnable to me.

* You have to spam your belt power to dodge, but there is nothing to eventually feel proud of. Your only satisfaction is to get a big combo number (which means you killed a lot and did not get hit). It does not make a big difference in the end since it's not rewarding.
* Since youve have to farm the levels to become stronger, you will have to come back at their beginning. The map usually pops when it's too late, when it pops. Traps make you wait forever when the game could be fast with your grapplin hook. At least fast when the boss is dead.
* The traps are lame and uninspired : you have to wait the boring timing or take ridiculous risks. 
* Secondar weapons are meh. They have no secondary purpose. I did not find any secret passage even if a npc told me they existed. I know i could use a bomb to open it but i cant find the skull indicator anymore. What are the odds ? Why did they spent time to make create different weapons that have such the same output ?
* NPC could be absent, that would not change anything. Let me fight them, or have secret interactions or anything. Why are they so many since they all do the same nothing ?
* Devil deals are always the same : give health to get more xp. That means you will die earlier to make your future runs better ?  So epic.
* Arenas are ok in ie Guacamelee because attacks/commands feel satisfying : the gameplay is fun. When your special thing is a belt that slows down time to dodge, it's not fun.
* I want to skip the starting/ending animation of a level.

Imho the developers did not play their game, because it's not fun the way it is.",False

Tractor tag, truck races, fighting over who gets to collect from the harvester... or messing up her finely tuned system for harvesting logs. Muahahahaha!!!

"It looks and sounds like a DS game, but it doesnt feel like it. 

Pros- Technically and mechanically, gameplay is smooth, graphics are a nice upgrade from DS1.  Movement is responsive.  DS1 can feel a tad sluggish but it makes sense because you are in a heavy suit.  New weapons are interesting.  Original DS story was intriguing, so it was nice to see what life was like after DS1.  More surprises in areas you wouldnt expect. But it became a bit predictable as the game moved along. Game pad supported.  Seems to support any resolution.  I played on surround/eyefinity settings, looks great.  I enjoyed the zero gravity experience, its too bad they didnt expand on this a bit more by adding more combat here. You get a bunch of suits right at the start, I believe they are DLC suits and weapons- Earthgov suit, Bloody Force gun.

Cons- First hour of the game got off to a nice start but it started to feel heavy, in a non-entertaining way.  In general Id say, less is more with this game.  Dialogue in general I found to be uninteresting.  DS1 was well edited despite some backtracking, but it was done well and was rather enjoyable. In general only what was absolutely necessary to move the game along and hook you in. Voice acting by the main actors were disappointing. The game felt less cohesive.  Hallucination/flashbacks were ok at first, but after constantly being bombarded by them, it became an annoyance.  Half the time Nicole is mumbling, or screaming about something which I could barely understand without turning on subtitles. The tone of the game is confusing as well.  Is Isaac traumatized or did he recover already from his travails?  He talks and acts like nothing has happened to him and belongs in another game or another world or another life perhaps before DS1.  In fact, this game's tone would have been a more appropriate as a prelude to DS1 and DS1 being the great sequel. oh well. 

TIP: 1) dont upgrade your HP until you upgraded your weapons.  HP is more a bonus than anything and not necessary on normal.  I didnt upgrade until the final 2 chapters or so.  2)  if you want to blow through the game, literally and just destroy things, start with the force gun, upgrade it as much as possible, save your ammo for when you need it.  It is OP.  Use any other tool to fill in the gaps in between. I used Line Gun upgraded most of the time and when things got out of control I popped to my force gun to plow through whatever was in my way.  My approach is to blow things away, not get cute and spend time severing an arm here or leg there because when things get hairy, you want to be quick and efficient.  Also upgraded a pulse rifle for targets far away or when you need to be more precise and at range.  You will want something like this at the end.  At most I think you want to carry 3 weapons. because you barely have the space to carry ammo for four weapons until the end, and by then you dont need four different weapons.

Overall, its an OK game, but a let down from DS1.  Worth playing as a sequel, but nothing memorable.",False

"Lovely art style and a cool concept. Just felt unfinished. There's so much more they could do with it, and I don't know why they haven't and just released it as a sort of 'bare-bones' even though this is a sequel.

I didn't really get much satisfaction from it. By the time my cubs had either died or left, i had only encountered 2 herds of non-rabbit animals, so hunting was a bit of a non-event for me. One cub died without me even knowing - so my Lynx can sense a rabbit from 100 yards but not the illness and death of its own cub? This also limited the emotional impact of the 'death'. Also the map is impossible to understand so you have no idea where you are. The camera angle is shallow so you can't really look around very well, and there are loads of bugs - my game crashed loads of times and animals would jump all over the place.

I'd love to see them really expand on the content of this game. How about training, learning new skills, increasing in strength, speed etc.

I'm going to mark this as 'not recommended' as I don't think the quality or content is up to scratch. It feels like an early access game but is not marked as such. However, it is a novel concept and I'll probably play through again just in case I have better luck, and I'm sure plenty will enjoy it.",False

"I'll update this after putting some more time into it, but for now; this game grabbed me at a time when I'm having a hard time finding games that can do that. It's darkly creepy, it controls extremely well and is intuitive, and sort of feels like old-school Nintendo era Strider.    
    
And the visuals are outstanding. In a sea of pixel games, it's great to have a game that can emulate the play style that all those retro games are trying to achieve, and Sundered does it while looking like a modern-era game. I love the aesthetics of it, from the main character to the world to the enemies, the creepy language the tetrahedron uses, and the music. It's atmospheric and beautiful, and I wish more games would attempt the artistry like this game rather than just defaulting to retro-pixel easy laziness.    
    
The waves of endless enemies slowly increasing seems daunting at first, but it's not by accident; you're sort of racing against the clock each time you come back to life, with the enemy surges serving to give you a swift kick back to the level screen to power up and give it another go. I can see where people would get frustrated, but it seems to be by design; dying isn't desirable, but it's not terrible and you just need to accept you're going to do it sometimes and use it as a stepping stone to progress.    
   
It's not Dark Souls difficult, but the approach is similar; don't get frustrated, learn from your mistakes and move forward a step at a time if you need to. Get better, be stronger, and enjoy the journey; from what I can tell, even if you're not good at the game as long as you're getting xp to spend you'll eventually be strong enough to continue.",True

"Knowing almost nothing about Skyrim, I initially supposed you were to be a hero in that world. The game encourages you to become a villain in lots of its side quests and to even kill the good guys (Dawnguard dudes, for example). I can't tell I'm totally happy with that, but the game is really cool and enjoyable. Sometimes kinda creepy (caves, freaking dwarven ruins and their ambiance...) but realistic at the same time, and fun. 
Now talking about the good stuff, there are lots of beautiful places to explore, the soundtrack is pretty cool, it's exciting to face a dragon and protect a village, town or city (that's what I was looking for, and the main quests does provide it). I play as the stealth/archer type and love it. The leveling and crafting system are well-made. Something very important to me is voice acting and I give a big thumb up to that in this game.

"Before I get into detail, I'd like to say I feel really sorry for those who bought this when it cost $60. This game is a free-roam shooter with many similarities to the Borderlands franchise. It's not the most amazing shooter you'll find, but I can definitely say you will get your money's worth now that it's at $10. It's kinda like borderlands styled co-op with MMO at the same time, you'll meet a LOT of new people and fight to compete in arkfalls, volge sieges, and considerably more. The leveling system is very slow in relation of start/max level (10/5000, I'm around 1500 now) and such is often also the case with finding new weapons, but the game does have updates, plenty is subject to change (they certainly have room to improve).

"I will start off by saying I enjoyed the hell out of the first game and this one did an even better job in some ways. There are a few mishaps in it with the disconnecting in multiplayer but that is not an issue if you make friends in game. lol

I love the idea of the team and how it has grown and picked up some awesome new characters like John Wick(Great movie). I enjoy the massive amount of weapon and skill options and if you pay attention it is an easy game to get the hang of.

I have put over 76 hours into the game when I am writing this and I am still by no means bored. there are always strange things that can happen and they keep updating it.

The huge amount of new content they add is just awesome and keeps the game fresh. I also enjoy that even though the weapons are paid add-ons the heists that go with them are free.

"this game is a classic. i didnt play it back when it released, but i remember seeing it in a games magazine and it sounded very cool. 

this review is aimed at people who like me havent played the original game.

so the intro drags on quite a bit, the fist thing you're gonna notice is that there are cutscenes in the game with super slow dialogue that you cant really make faster unless you skip it with the inventory key (F1 on keyboard and mouse). most other dialogue is as fast as you want it to be.

gameplay is kinda like 3D zelda, there are breakable pots and puzzles. but combat is action jrpg style with enemies appearing on the overwold and battle starting if you run into them. 

the main gimmick of this game is that you can press a button and then paint something into the overworld or even in battle. you unlock brush techniques as you progress in the game. when you want to paint in the overworld, for most of those techniques there are certain objects you can interact with with different techniques. you can draw searose leaves on water, cut specific stuff, draw a sun, help vegetation blossom, undo cursed environments and many more...

its a blast to control with keyboard and mouse. since you can use your mouse as brush. you can finetune the sensitivity just as you would on your desktop. for players of the modern era i would recomment to reverse all camera angles so they feel like 3D games standard today.

the artstyle is amazing. it really aged well and the remake made it stand out even more. the frames are capped at 30 sadly, but weirdly enough due to all the filters and watercolor blurryness of the game, it doesnt really feel like 30 fps most of the time.

i also love the plot and characters in this game. the game doesnt take itself too seriously, there are loads of really wacky characters that you just gotta love. like the elder of the first village mr. orange.

for completionists there is plenty to find, there are different weapons to experiment with due to a mainhand offhand mechanic.

incredible game, mostly good port, even if you are a framerate nazi you should give it a try. because its really playable in this framerate and you wont notice it too much due to the artstyle. i play overwatch in 144hz and trust me, in most games a 30 fps cap would bother me.",True

Being about to complete quests/missions and craft things is amazing. Even more amazing.... I don't have to hassle with getting attacked or beat up by a creature or person while roving around looking for items. I can take my time and enjoy myself, the npc's, and sites.

"Having played countless hours of Front Office Football Seven, I have to say I'm disappointed with this version.

The controls are now very kludgey making navigation much more tedious and painful. For example, in Seven, you can easily navigate to your roster from the Draft Preview screen and in Eight, it's a separate view. Another example is when handling free agency, to negotiate a new contract, you have to open the team roster, identify who's due for re-signing then open them up. Then after re-sign, you have to close else the player windows stack up.

In season screen, it's no longer obvious how the team is doing on a game by game basis relative to others in the conference. You now have to navigate to another screen to see that.

It's just too tedious and frankly, I'm going back to Seven. Had they retained the Seven navigation, I'd be very excited but instead, I'm disappointed.

"Let me start off by saying this is my first review.

This is an exceptional tactical game with some strategic aspects.  I would offer, in my opinion, that this is one of the best tactical games I've seen (and I've been playing them for some 10 to 20 years...).  The strategic aspects revolve around planning your warband's skills and attributes to meet your playstyle needs, assuming you can keep your members alive that is..

I love the campaign aspect of the game.  I would like a story that pulls me in a little deeper but that being said I am still really enjoying the game.

I believe the to hit percentages are off.  I'm not sure the random logic/table that is used but after many games I'm finding the to-hit percentages really don't accurately reflect the chance to hit.  I will try to measure this more meticulously and possibly update this review in the future, but would like to see the game designers run some analysis on how accurate their numbers are.

In Summary this is an exceptional game.  If you've been looking at it thinking 'maybe', I'm confident you won't be disappointed.

"Northgard is a very slow paced ""RTS lite"" style game. The core mechanic of gaining villagers is very slow and makes the early part of the match a waiting game. If you aren't a fast thinker it can be a good game as it deals in a relatively low number of units compared to other RTS games (I end my matches at around 40 pop). Games take FOREVER and little happens in them as gaining victories by combat is the slowest way to win, but also the most logistically challenging. Hopping straight into a match without a tutorial the most complicated part of the game was the happiness mechanic which artificially stunts your population growth if you get too big, everything else is pretty easy to grasp.

The clans have minor differences that can change what your main strategy is (raiding vs eco vs lore vs fame), but for the most part all units besides your one warchief are identical. You start with a whopping six clans and there are seven dlc only, which pretty much all the most unique things are locked behind the dlc. 

If I had to rate the game overall I'd give it a 5-6/10 as someone who likes a bit faster paced games, but because of the yes/no system it gets a no from me. What finally pushed me to write this is that the creative and conquest modes (both can be played singleplayer) are server hosted, so while the servers are offline you are not allowed to play them even singleplayer, and no option to play peer-to-peer, which in my experience would run better than the laggy servers.",False

"Have you ever wanted to experience a medically induced coma? Then this is the game for you. 

This game could obviously have been a great hit, however for me the initial pacing was so slow that I simply lost the will to go on. The UI offers an insight into what could be complex and rewarding gameplay but for me it has to be fun; something, sadly, this game isn't. I played through the flight tutorial, the fist combat encounter and the final nail in the coffin a ""patrol"" mission. 

It was the ""patrol"" mission that killed the game for me. After ten minutes of flying around as my brain cells committed suicide I finally saw my adversary. After using the games fast travel to traverse 50kms to engage him, ( there's something about having the ability to jump between planets in seconds but taking FOREVER to cross trivial distances like this is a bit odd) once in range we proceeded to engage in a spectacular dog fight i.e. we flew at each other head on, passed by without managing to hit each other, swung around and tried again. And again. And again... I was able to stop my ship completely and slowly navigate through the menus looking for tips. I briefly tabed out to visit the oracle that is Google. When I got back from making a cup of tea I noticed my shields had been knocked down to about 25%. 

I quit the game and promptly uninstalled it. I'm sorry, I tried but this is just not for me. I like my games to be engaging and challenging but they have to be enjoyable above all else.

"First, let me start off by saying, if your a total war fan, or a fan of other very RTS games with frontline action and controlability, then BUY THIS GAME. RIGHT NOW.

Now then... Ive had this game since it was in a state of human vs AI only, and it was suggested by a clan leader and friend of mine whom i saw play quite frequently. He told me the features and i was pretty psyched to say the least. Just so i dont make this review paragraph based, let me number off the pros and cons and info.

Pro's:

1. The Dev and The AI Behavior

 This game was made by a popular Mod developer for the total war series, more specifficaly, the Darth Mod series. yes, same guy. And please take very good note of this, THE AI WILL KICK YOUR ASS. Im VERY suprised CA hasnt hired this guy for the Total War series yet for thier new A.I. behavior manager! The Computer acts just like a human in some if not all instances depending on the way you want it to act, its VERY releiving to see a compinant AI smashing a human player. If you buy this game, thinking that its just another game that youll steam roll the AI in, your wrong. Period.

2. Genuine BattleField terrain and locations

I live in mid Michigan, and the Gettysburg battlefield is roughly 300 miles away. I am also a dedicated Civil War reenactor, and historian, and i have been to Gettysburg and other battle sites multiple times. I must say, the developer has really put time into making the battlefield map as authentic as possible. By doing so, he has the terrian set just right, theres ALOT of small locations like the Penn. College, and several small areas like family houses, mansions and farmhouses with titles signifying the property. This really adds to your sence of thinking, like instead of thinking, 'Gotta hold that house' or 'Hold that hill' your more in a state of mind saying 'Hold the Henery House Property', 'Hold Oak Ridge', 'Defend the Unsbruck road'. It all makes you feel like more of a gerneral than most offical game companies for RTS and frontline action.

3. Realistic Chain of Command and Regiments

Instead of Regimental numbers and which state their from, theres titles to mark each regiment, or birgade by their colonel, core leader, or the actual nick name they had during the war. Like the Iron Birgade, The Texan Birgade, Bucktail Birgade, Irish Birgade, Kelly's Birgade, and thats just to name a few of the nick named. Other more common units are named after historical regimental commanders and birgadier generals who were present at the battle. THAT is true dedication to the games authenticity :)

4. A very high sence of carnage and urgency 

Most people dont mindor think about this, but i beleive every war game should have sound effects of not only weapons, but voices and screaming and other things to give a more sence of the heat of battle. Whenever i engage the enemy, the new sounds of battle erupt and i feel like im more rushed or needed of concentration just to see it through. Plus, bodies stay where they lie, and it makes the feild more littered with the dead to give a better sence of war horror and chaos. One time, me and a freind playing online (explained later) fought over a wheat feild for nearly 20 minutes, and in that time, it switched posetion between us nearly 17 times! It was grusome!

5. Simple but very robust multiplayer

Dont expect this game to have a server or host list, but instead it has a mainly matchmaking based mulitplayer system. better yet, it even ranks your person and you can even select avatars! Though theyre only portraits of generals from both the Union and Confederacy, and nothing much else, which is a little dissapointing. 

6. WHERES THE REINFORCMENTS!?

Throughout the 3 days at the battle of Gettysburg, both armies were conjured in a day or so by the arrival of reinforcements from different roads in order to manifest their armies into a whole. Reinforcemnets, are DEPENDED upon in this game to ensure victory for either side, and its very nerve racking to wait for their arrival. They even come in various sizes, types, and diractions to the feild of battle. So it really dicates where they can help most immediately, or spend time to get to another area. 

7. The enemy army is breaking camp, let us do the same...

During a human vs AI battle, the fight can last to a max of 4 days or so. You only have so much time in a day to capture all objective locations or to route the enemy army until both sides being too exhausted to fight and break camp for the next day fallowing. Whats even more cool is that the gains or losses you make in one day can influence the lines of battle for the day fallowing, THAT is awsome and i cant even beleive no RTS game developer companies have even considered making that system an element in their games yet without making it for the prupose of cinimatic.

Cons:

1. The line of sight for cannons 

Cannons were a must have in both armies during the period, but in this game, it takes alot to get them operating effeicantly. Cannons must be set up with a proper line of fire in order to fire on the enemy, so youll be CONSTANTLY checking your artilleries line of fire. It also sucks that the Ai cant even automatically deploy them to a favored postion after being ordered to attack a certian enemy. I even had a battery of cannons on a hill overlooking an open feild in which the enemy were crossing, and they didnt even open fire! The enemy was completely exposed as well, and it even cost me the battle because they didnt open fire even though they were overlooking a hill. Be aware, the LOF for artillery peices, are VERY picky.

2. Poor/Slow morale recharge and gain

In game, Southern armies have more of a moral boost because historically, they were mostly made of volunteers willing to fight, whislt most of the Northern armies have lower moral sicne alot where drafties and didnt even want to be in the army in the first place. However, once moral is depelted for a unit, its over for them. They might as well leave the feild because theyll be so useless. I had a birgade of 1280 southern men, and after being repulsed, they automatically got behind the lines to safety, but the moral was jacked. i checked on them and their morale seemed fine enough to get back into the action, but as soon as they get near the fight, theyre morale was depleted, and mind you none of them were even fired upon when that happened. Even on the Northern side more especially, if a units morale goes below 20%, its over for them. They wont have the will to fight anymore. This needs to have at least a curtiosy balance or fix to be more acceptable. 

3. Once more into the breech men!... men!?...

Charging the enemy is a needed factor in the game, but it needs to be a little tweaked. The Confederate armies have the benifit of actually fallowing through a charge but the Union wont even charge at all. Theyll hold their ground with great dediction, but a charge, even against the smallest units, just kills the moral of the Union units and they all run away before a charge even commences. It somewhat defeats the purpose of have a charge option while playing as the Union.


Final Verdict:

This game came out of the blue, and it wasnt another board game based civil war game nor a mod for a half assed RTS. Ultimate General is a slight arcade like game but its a mus thave for all RTS fans and those of 'frontline' combat. Like i said however, some tweaking might have to be done here and there, but the Pro's far outway the Con's. 

I give this game, a 7/10 in its current state. 

8/10 if your a Civil War history fanatic or an RTS fanatic for that matter, AND if the developer tweaks the strengths and weaknesses and morale of both sides. 

This game DESERVES to be a series, not only that for JUST the Civil War era, but maybe Napoleonic Wars, 1700 Wars, Crimean War; it DOES have great potential! And i encourage the dev to keep up dedicated work!",True

"While the trailer looked very promising to me, the game does not look at all like this and is a major failure given a couple of key issues. As background, my favorite game genre is RTS, and I'm a fan of Command & Conquer and Starcraft II which I continue to play.

I've tried to play this game many times, but each time the visuals force me to quickly abandon. A major problem is tied to scale. Humans are way too small compared to buildings to distinguish or really see them, forcing me to zoom in. But then,  the field of view is super small, and moving from one point to another in the big maps takes ages.

To have a usable zoom level, I have to zoom out, but units and vehicles are then small and uninteresting. They could easily be replaced by boxes or circles.

The design (shapes, colors) of the buildings, vehicles and units is also quite old and unpleasant. Everything looks pixelated, ancient CGI and much worse than Command & Conquer Red Alert or Tiberium, despite these games being released many many years earlier. I had to check several times that the game was released late 2015, as opposed to early 2000.

I had high hopes that those mediocre visuals were only tied to my limited hardware. So I re-run the game on a powerful set up: Xeon processor, GTX 1080, professional, wide color 4K screen (LG UltraFine), settings set to the max. Visuals were as mediocre and didn't even look anything close to 4K, not even Full HD.

The movements of the units and vehicles is also unconvincing if not ridiculous. Units for exemple often seem to float or glide when they are supposed to run or walk.

In addition of being visually a real pain, missions are not that interesting or challenging (the first ones, as i gave up on trying the rest).

At the end of the day, this game could have been great with appealing, modern visuals, appropriate scale of units, vehicles and buildings, and more interesting and challenging missions.",False

"Generic MMORPG. It tries to be clever and different but ends up being clunky, awkward and uninspired. I don't hate it; it can be fun but often it's more of a grind. The final nail in the coffin to any would be buyer would be that this is an MMO yet most of the story missions are SOLO ONLY. So if you solo in MMOs anyway, this won't be a problem for you. For the other 95% of you that play MMOs you will need to bear this in mind before paying for it. 

It has a plethora of other issues too, like inconsistant aggro ranges, some mobs which are too hard to find and some mobs which are packed so tightly that you have to spend a ton of time fighting through them to do the many fetch quests, often fighting the same spawns more than once because the mobs respawn so quickly and are packed so tightly, so by the time you've killed something and are fighting the next mob, the previous one has just respawned. I wouldn't recommend this game unless it's on sale. Luckily it doesn't have subscription fees anymore, so it's a pay once game, unless you want to pay for microtransactions, which I'm glad to say, aren't pay to win. All things considered: 5/10. Not horrendous but definately nothing to write home about. Far too generic and shoddily made for me.",False

This game use to be very friendly to multiboxers. It was the last ""safe space"" left that a lot of MMOs have either discouraged or completely banned.

As I write this, they have 24 people online. The game is dead. Completely dead, and these guys have just killed any possibility for future revival from the multiboxing community, and killed it for even some people who still wanted to play.

"King's Bounty: Warriors of the North is a fantastic title to anyone interested in turn based strategy games. Much like Heroes, you travel across lands building up an army and then use said army to fight in a grid based system, with many different combinations to swap between. 

Unlike heroes you don't have a base though, but more tend to visit other castles to do your recruting, where some might greet you warmly whilst others turn around and attack you as you draw closer.

"I did not know what to expect when I played this game for the fist time. It was unlike any other game I'd ever played in a lot of ways from the way it's played, the way it looks, the characters, and the interactions. I fell in love with the game before I even realized I'd been zoned into it for hours. This gave a whole new perspective on a sort of post-war life while also giving insight on what happened to get where you are. The fact you play 3 different characters, all whom of which have their own stories for how they got where they were (Not including the 3 extra's you get if you include the DLC) and their own personal missions, is a big thing for me. You get to learn so much and see different aspects of the world all during the same time period.

Even the DLC's add more and more to the story so you are still gaining as well as getting extra content and being able to enjoy the game further. Each character has their own set of weaknesses and strengths and you have to learn to traverse this world as them and figure out the best way to survive with each one. All in all, I give this game a definite thumbs up and I would suggest anyone to give it a chance and you may end up finding yourself delightfully immersed for hours without even meaning to.

P.S. : It's not my fault if you miss work or other such things.

That gets annoying that you can't see anything clearly more than a couple hundred yards away ever. Also the boats. If I craft a houseboat damnit that thing better not tilt, and I better be able to build a sleeping mat inside of it or something, also something to cook with, otherwise what's the point of calling it a ""Houseboat"" if you can't make it your home.

"Grim Fandango is a fantastic game. I've always heard about this game being a masterpiece of the point-and-click genre, but I never played it until very recently, and I must say, I was blown away by it.

The story takes place in the Eight Underworld, and you play as Manny Calavera, an employee of the Department of Death, in charge of picking up the souls of the recently dead and then sell them travel packages to the Ninth Underworld, the final resting place for all souls. However, after a string of pretty bad sales, Manny decides it's time to get himself the score of a lifetime, but he ends up uncovering a conspiracy that could alter the nature of the Eight Underworld.

The gameplay is that of a typical point-and-click game, you move around the place, interact with different objects, talk to people, and solve puzzles, either by using objects you've collected along the way, or by performing certain actions. It's very simple, but even then I have to admit that some of the puzzles left me a bit stumbled.

The art style of the game is very good. Of course, the characters are all blocky and the environments are pretty early 3D and background scenes, but even then, the game has got this charm to it, it doesn't feel aged at all. Even then, this is a Remastered version, and thus it's had some graphical improvements here and there. Anyway, I also love the mix of film noir and Aztec culture that it has going for it, makes the world feel pretty unique, and it certainly helps the story being told.

The writing in the game is another strong point; the story itself is pretty good, like I mentioned before, it seems taken out of a film noir, it's sort of a drama/detective thing, even though Manny isn't really a detective, I can't really explain it. And the dialogue is hilarious, there's lots of humour throughout the game. You can even make Manny interact with Manny different objects and get some funny responses. The soundtrack is also pretty good, and there's even a catchy song halfway through the game.

Overall, I'd say Grim Fandango is a fantastic game. I can't recommend it enough.",True
"I feel like 46 hours worth of gameplay is enough to judge this game, Its bad, This game is just all round bad, I really wanted it to be something good but its just not, after over 3 years in development you would think it would be a decent game but its really not.

Lets talk about it shall we?

Im an armaholic, I have over 2000 hours in arma 3 alone and more in other Bi games, I played ever type of game mood in the arma series from the Dayz mod to life mods, and I generally love everything that Bi games can do except Dayz.

Im Starving.

Im Starving.

I need to eat something.

This is the worst game mechanic in the history of game mechanics. Seriously? Why is this a thing? Every 30 seconds to a minute the game reminds you that you need to eat, even after you just ate. Only when you stuff yourself does it allow you a respite from this retarded and frankly idiotic system. even then, 10 minute's later....... I need to eat something

Im starving

Im starving

I feel like Im grinding in warthunder.

P.s you can actually see apples on the apple trees but apparently your character is blind or stupid, and will only find an apple 1 outa 5 times on the tree, Like wtf is that? if you cut down the apple tree? Do you all the apples from the tree? Nope they are magically gone.

Your ever decide to remove any of this this, I'll take another look at your game.

KOS- Kill on sight

For a survival game the developers have a very negitive outlook on how people would survive, in small groups, yes?

No, you are on your own, you will die, always and everywhere, even when you play with friends, and you work in a team, if you get shot, you are very likely to die before you can get help, Im okay with this, but its really not hard for the devs to add a system into the game that allows or even rewards team play. If your looking for a game that you can play realistly with friends? go play the Dayz mod or its countless spin offs, this is not a game you can play with friends as you will spend at least an hour getting back to them if you die, even give DAYZRP a goo if you can roleplay a bit as thay have rules on KOS.

I don't usually write reviews. But I feel as if this game and development team needs one. It is in early access so it is buggy and a little rough around the edges.

They are currenty working on a Patch the will give the game a marketplace and some other improvements. I highly recommend buying it for no other reason then to support the future development.

"Final Fantasy 7 – the first Playstation RPG I got my hands on back in the good old days. And even today I remember this one as a shiny gem, the best of the Final Fantasy series. But thats just my opinion soaked with a lot of nostalgia whenever I play it.

So, whats this game about?
You are Cloud Strife, an EX-""Soldier"",who used to work for Shinra, the world biggest corporation. Shinra's only interest is to suck as much ""Mako""-energy out of the planet as possible and use it to increase their power. So you end up with a group called ""Avalanche"" to oppose them. Cloud does not seem to care much about this at first - his reason to ""join"" Avalanche is referable to Tifa Lockhart, a childhood friend - but as you progress in the game, you will end up on a big journey facing a threat much bigger than Shinra.

The graphics are a little bit outdated, even the once beautiful backgrounds did not age to well, but the story and the amazing soundtrack do more than compensate for the graphics. You can also download some textures for the characters if you like to, which will make them look pretty impressive (Check the community-hub).
Final Fantasy 7 can be played with a keyboard but I find it much more comfortable to play with a controller. The 360-pad works fine but I recommend a keybinder like JoytoKey (freeware) so you can use all of your buttons and bind everything to your needs.

Steam is actually selling it for 12.99€ and let me ensure you; totally worth it!
It's extremely easy to put 100h+ into the game. First there is the main story, I think it took me about 60h back then. But there is much more to do(and discover) in between or at the end of the game including sidequests, hidden materias(magic) and items,breeding chocobos, some kind of RTS-battlefield and the Gold saucer; a huge theme park with attractions, minigames and an arena to test your skills.


My final verdict:
If you are into RPG's Final Fantasy 7 is a must have. For everyone else, if you judge a game just by it's graphics you might get disappointed otherwise give it a try (battles can be fought in ATB or turn-based).
The only downside is,that you have to register at Square-Enix to play the game. It sure get's a little bit annoying nowadays to create an account for every single publisher to play their games but atleast it is not a huge program, just create an account, check the mail and you are ready to go.

"I bought this game in the Introversion Bundle, because it meant that Prison Architect was cheaper that way. Having exhausted that game for a while, I decided to check out this game. And boy oh boy was I in for a treat.
I was blown away by the fantastic idea that the game introduced; exploring the dark by slowly revealing it. I've been aching for a spelunking game, (caves are fascinating to me) and this game satisfied that thirst more than I could have known.

The sound design is the best I have heard anywhere. Cracking open the Unity Audio Archive for this game reveals 1,247 seperate files, each a unique sound. It is deeply immersive, and the soundtrack interview reveals the reason why. Music is good, though the elevator song was a bit too ""bombastic"" for this sort of atmosphere. The only other Alistair Lindsay OST I've heard is the music for RCT3, and his style resonates through the game.

The graphics...well, there aren't any, are there? Besides the scanner dots, there are only a few scattered models and characters. The character design is a little...off-putting, but you only see it at the end, (and the beginning, if you look closely) thankfully. Level design is superb, and the models are quite sufficient.

And the experience? Headphones are a must for this game. The scary bits were only freaky at best, but I appreciated the effort. In terms of story, well...it tries to have one. It makes sense if you look at the story one way, but then totally falls apart when you look at it another way.

Overall, I recommend this game highly. It's one that can be played in about an hour if you're fast, but it's worth the price.",True

"It doesn't have the same charm as their earlier title, but it works on it in different ways. The gameplay can be very interesting in the first few sections of the game, but even with their powerups and customizations it ultimately felt quite monotonous. Bastion, however, kept things reasonably fresh by shifting a larger amount of the control away from the character based on the weapon employed, forcing them to relearn. 

Soundtrack work still excellent and capable of carrying the experience to great heights regardless of how you perceive the core experience. I appreciated the character design more in this title than their previous, if only because Red's cute as hell. Who knows; though, there's a chance I'm just failing to take in the full array of options available to me in the loadout.

"Since I played the first game, I've been eagerly awaiting for the localization of Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair.
I knew that fans who already played the japanese version were stating that this sequel was even better than the first episode - and after playing it myself I can easily understand why.

As usual with Spike Chunsoft games, Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is essentially a visual novel.
Expect lots of reading, but despite a not exactly ""top class"" translation the dialogues and writing is captivating and definitely interesting.
The pacing of the story is great, gradually ramping up until a finale that left me with my jaw open. The last part of the game is really something that must be experienced. The first game is known for its plot-twists, but the sequel blows that game out of the water. You will not expect what's going to happen, and this is good.

Having played the first game, Trigger Happy Havoc, is requirement if you want to fully understand and appreciate the whole storyline. The developers are expecting the players to be up to speed concerning the plot of the series, so do yourself a favor and get both games if you can.",True
"Pros: -Atmospheric, great universe building
-Perfect level of dynamic lighting and shadows. Not annoyingly dark like Doom 3.
-Great sound design and weapon feedback, huge step above D3 and even some modern shooters

Cons: -Poor checkpoint placement (lack of?)
-Unfun vehicle segments, vehicles are incredibly slow or limit mobility
-Some really stupid deaths
-A lot of loading between short levels

I'm glad I skipped Quake 4 way back when it was released. I was put off by Id's previous release of Doom 3 that left myself and a lot of others wondering wtf happened to Id and their ability to make fun games. At first I was having an enjoyable time, happy to find the gunplay that was absent from Doom 3 while still having an incredible amount of attention to details in the world building, design, and even the military atmosphere. Characters have decent dialogue and good characterization that is very realistic, although it does have a Call of Duty feeling sometimes.

However, there are segments that started to wear on me. The tank segment was more of a chore than fun. Controls are floaty (well, I guess it IS a hovertank) but not in a good way. Your weapons feel anemic in vehicles with slow firing machineguns and turrets that take several shells to knock out even some of the smaller Strogg infantry. The walker segment was just frustrating. Strafing becomes extremely slow and clumsy, and you just feel incredibly limited in mobility. It's a really slow, tactical battle when you face off against one of those giant enemy crab things that ends without much feeling of achievement. Special vehicle segments should make you want to do it again! They should feel like a theme park ride that was over too soon.

There are also some cheap deaths like getting knocked off a platform when a Strogg crab thing kicks a car at you and too bad if you didn't save you'll have to trek all the way there and find out where the little safe spot to stand is. Or how about running through a tight catwalk and having a hidden barrel around the corner shot at just as you come around, killing you instantly? You may also find yourself committing suicide with the grenade launcher a lot, a weapon that apparently has a blast radius bigger than its range. Not a good weapon for the mostly tight corridors you fight in. And a lot of the other weapons seem pointless, at least on higher difficulties. The railgun is less effective than your shotgun. Rockets do barely any damage. The lightning gun is so weak. Basically a good sized arsenal, but they all get pushed to the side for the machine gun and shotgun which are just insanely effective from the start. 

Some strong points though are the atmosphere. Wandering through the Strogg facilities fills you with dread as lovecraftian horror permeates the Stroggs architecture. The segment where you yourself are transformed into a Strogg through surgical means is absolutely horrific. And that's the strength of Quake 4 is being scary and nervewracking without relying on jump scares like Doom 3 did. Wondering what greater abomination the Strogg will unleash generates enough fear.

But despite its strengths the game just feels lacking and mediocre. It came out in late 2005 and has no excuse to have such shortcomings (even in places like its menu) when big name titles like Halo set the standard way back in 2001. A game like that still holds up today while Quake 4 feels antiquated and tedious to play. You can tell Id was just on a downhill slope, trying to copy aspects from other games but never really figuiring out how to make another fun FPS. Just look at Rage. Good concepts, but often mediocre executions with some bad design decisions here and there.",False

"Playing this game is like watching your satellite tv through an electric storm. There are several sections that are so bad I was playing in some kind of screen whiteout. Visually, it is terribly optimised for Windows 10, so sadly my review will be coloured by this experience...and some colour would have been welcome in this game. If feel like I've been staring at some razzle dazzle camouflage for the last 12 hours. 

The game has developed since the previous instalment - 'Chaos Theory'; that was more of the same, a sort of large DLC packaged as a new full length game. Here, in 'Double Agent' they have genuinely tried to develop the game. To begin with most of the game takes place in a hub - the bad guys den in New York and you alternate in missions between here and global assignments. It seems like a bit of a cheat as it deprives you of terrific locations to explore and conquer in the best stealth approach, now you only have half of them and every other level you return to this tedious backdrop. After each global mission to come back here and you are left hitting locked doors in the bad guys crib that only open to another area next time you return. Worse is that every time you have to return here you have to move about in the same fashion, compelled to repeat ever larger sections until you get to the newly unlocked section. If there's something a game should never do, it's force you to repeat something for no good reason. Well get used to it, because you are back in this hub about four times doing this...wondering 'am supposed to be collecting fingerprints now or is it not possible yet?'. It's like a weakly planned RPG in this respect. 

The game also has a new development in the semblance of choice. As the 'double agent' you can choose between working for the bad guys or the NSA and gradually you lose influence with one and gain with another depending on your choices. Whilst it's a nice effort to move Splinter Cell on and do something a bit more with the game, the choices are pretty stark...execute this innocent you know and work with or not. This doesn't make for particularly difficult moral ground, but should you choose to indulge your nagging psychopathic thoughts you can arrive by the end of the game at one of three alternative endings and a bonus mission if you choose the 'right' path.

Sadly I never got to see this ending as the game repeatedly crashed upon entering the final cutscene...and no matter how much I reloaded it, I was denied the ending. After shovelling graphical shit for 10 hours to have the final cut scene fail on me and not know which ending I would get was quite the screen punch. It's a thin and frustrating substitute to find myself reading some blog post to discover what ending I should have been presented with and this is the problem with Double Agent. It's got some new ideas, from teaming up with a buddy in the initial mission, to the hub area of missions and even the element of choice, but it is all executed like you forgot to pierce the cellophane on your instant curry and instead of a delicious beef rendang you get an explosion of dog turd and end up scrubbing the walls inside the microwave. What a disappointment.

On the plus side...and these are few. Michael Ironside is back to play Sam Fisher, but there is far less talk and sass from him than we expect, so that's not enough of one of the few good things. The voice acting has always been a strength in these games, not so much here. The music is pretty bland and works in the standard heightened crescendo when enemies are near fashion, passable but dull I suppose. Weapons are limited, but there are some nice set pieces to the game. On one mission you need to bug a meeting that is in a secure communications box and surrounded by laser alarms. This is a great bit of Splinter Cell action, requiring patience and skill to deliver the goods. But apart from that all the new ideas are ruined by the graphical apocalypse you must endure and periodic crashing of the game. I'm sure they could deliver a patch pretty easily if they cared, but it retails very cheaply and very few people bother to play it, so it seems it isn't worth the effort. 

This is the least popular and least played of the Splinter Cell series with less than 500 completions listed on Howlongtobeat.com, that's about 30% of Conviction or Blacklist. It also has a very high retirement rate of over 6% and I really did struggle not to add to that. 

 It is a shame, because this game has some new features that could have delivered with a little more thought and if those weak ideas were not compounded further with terribly optimised graphics. If you do bother to play this game there's about 10-12 hours of your time here, but you will be wishing you spent it elsewhere. Unfortunately this game is an easy 'No'. Don't waste your time people, enough of it has been taken up by reading this review, move on to another game...at least another in the series.",False

"What could I possibly say about Sonic Mania? I'm a 90's baby, so I definitely grew up with the Genesis Sonic games, and what Sonic Mania manages to do here is appeal to long time fans of Sonic, as well as newcomers to the franchise. Mania basically re-imagines some of the stages from all of the Genesis Sonic games (the first acts of the stages start out looking and feeling familiar, and then the second acts are totally different from the original second act layouts) while mixing it up with brand new zones that still provide Easter eggs and references from the original games. Instead of fighting only Robotnik (or Eggman, whichever you prefer), you're fighting his robotic minions as well in each zone, and how some of the boss battles play out will give you that, ""I remember this"" feeling. Seeing the zones that I remember from my childhood being given a modern renovation amazed me, and I'm having fun with this game! I still need to try out the Encore mode though, so I'm sure that's gonna be fun too.

I personally recommend getting this game whether you're a long time fan of Sonic or a newcomer to the franchise.",True

"Ok I see that this game has gotten many bad reviews but that’s because I think people do not understand this game was made with Game Guru. That engine does not have the same power as more popular engines like Unity or Unreal. So going into this game I knew the capabilities of the engine and what it had to offer. I also have some experience with Game Guru and its previous versions when it was called FPS Creator. Now with that said and out of the way I really enjoyed this experience. The first thing that struck me was the graphics. Yes, Game Guru does not feature the best graphics on the market but I was surprised at how good this looked at Game Guru standards. It created a great atmosphere and got me sucked into the game. The second thing was the sound design. The placement of sound effects and music were placed at perfect times to give the jump scares an authentic feel rather than cheap. Overall I really enjoyed this coming from a fellow Game Guru user and for $2 I would say give it a try.",True
"I have been following this game's development since Nitronic Rush (if you don't know what that is you need to check that out). After playing a crapton of trackmania and burnout paradise years ago, i needed a new fix. 
After first seeing the trailer for Distance i thought, ""wow! Trackmania and Tron had a baby, that's so cool, look at all the new shit you can do since Nitronic Rush! Im behind these devs 100% and giving them my money NOW!"". 

That was years ago. Almost nothing substantial has really changed. The addition of the steam workshop is the only thing keeping the game alive at all. It's such a shame. I used to have such high hopes for Distance, but it isn't even out of Beta. There isn't even a propper campaign yet. They keep saying that they are currently working on it and thier team is small and all that. But lets be real here, this game has been in early access for over 3 years now.

It has a lot of problems, such as unchangeable graphics settings (I'm also running with a GTX 780, so thats not a problem), shoddy gameplay mechanics, and overall cruddy gameplay. The First Person Shooter aspect of the game is done lazily and messily. Pistols are also just as good as sniper rifles, which just adds to the stupidity of the game. In addition to this, the squad system within the game doesn't even work half of the time, and it can be a real pain just to get in a squad with your friends. It honestly feels like the devs kind-of half-assed this game into open development. This game has a lot of work that needs to be done to improve it.

"IN SHORT: A very difficult game in the tradition of NES Metroid and Castlevania.

Within the last year or so I learned the term ""Metroidvania"" and it seems like it was made for this game.  Gameplay reminds me a lot of the original Metroid, and then you're whipping skeletons just like Castlevania.

I guess I was warned, but this is a hard game.  As if fighting your way through the ruins wasn't hard enough already there are hidden booby traps (frustrating, but adds a fun new element as well).

I love the mix of cultural artifacts from around the world you see, and I like the story of the Mother Goddess who created the Earthly races in hopes they could return her to the heavens--and who periodically kills them off when they anger her.

You find lots of clues on stone tablets (which may apply to something you'll find in a whole different area).  In theory it'd be fun to piece together the story like this, but I've found them more difficult to understand and sort of generic sounding (this is probably do in part to the translation from Japanese).

I've made some progress (defeated one boss) and am hoping I can get past the difficulty factor and really get into this game, but it's possible I might give up.

"It's an interesting take on the genre, as you're just one person making minor contributions (unless you make a whole team of characters and control them 24/7).

"This is literally trench warfare. Some people hate it, some people love it. It really depends on the type of person you are. I love studying and researching the two world wars. There are so many way you can die. Standing up only once could kill you. The feeling of not being safe anywhere but still managing to be successful is great.

There are many guns that you can choose. Some are not good but some are. This is world war 1 we are talking about. Factories were trying to mass produce guns like crazy so it is realistic that not everyone can get the best weapon. Aside from this, the look and sounds of the guns are amazing! They are what I look forward to every time I play the game.

The downside to this game is the lack of players. I am constantly shifting between the North American server and the European server. Usually at least one of them has at least 50 players. I'd rather play with low ping than with bots. The ease of it would bore me.

"Having played the hell out of all the Command & Conquer games since Tiberian Sun(except C&C4, most of us know why), I'd have to put C&C3 at my second favorite behind the impeccable Red Alert 2 and Yuri's Revenge. For most C&C fans, this game really nails the basic formula while improving on a number of other aspects and in my opinion, it's also the last C&C game that was seriously good.

The basic gameplay is same as before: start with an MCV, build up a base, harvest resources, and crank out troops to destroy your enemy. Where C&C3 differs from it's predecessors is that it's several quality of life additions do a great deal in speeding up the gameplay. For example, infantry are now trained in squads as opposed to single units(though they still behave as such) and production structures can now be individually queued up with separate tabs for each building. War factories and air pads also automatically repair vehicles near them which eliminates the need for service depots. Finally, the addition of outposts and cranes makes expansion much less expensive than building new MCVs.

By far the biggest addition though is the upgrades and support powers system. This is very similar to what Generals did although support powers are now directly acquired from upgrades opposed to a separate points system. Otherwise the system works largely the same as Generals where you can upgrade your units with anything from better weapons or armor(railgun Mammoths!). Personally I never found a huge use for the support powers but everyone's strategy is different. However upgrading your units can turn the tide of battle and sometimes make low tier units a lot more formidable against higher tier units.

There are some downsides though, especially if you look at it's predecessor: Tiberian Sun. The atmosphere of this game is a big step back from TS and everything just looks super drab by comparison. Terrain is no longer destructable, Tiberium no longer spreads unchecked, and there is no longer any fauna or ion storms out to kill you. As a result, the environment is no longer a hazard and I feel like the look and feel of the game suffers as a result, even though the gameplay is arguably superior. I've never been too big on the campaigns but I also felt like C&C3's wasn't nearly as entertaining as TS's campaign, lore problems aside. It's still not bad, but I think the step back in atmosphere is a big mark against the campaign in this game.

That being said, the game itself doesn't look bad despite being over ten years old at this point and should run on most machines without too many hiccups. Third party mod support is also very good for this particular game and Moddb has tons of mods for this game in active development. My personal favorite is Tiberium Essence which adds a whole bunch of units and features from Tiberian Sun; great if you were missing stomping around in Titans.

If you're a fan of C&C, this one is definitely worth checking out. It's far closer to the experience of the old isometric games than Generals(still an awesome game in it's own right) and I personally think it's light years better than Red Alert 3. Kane's Wrath is also worth checking out if you want more units to play around with but I think the base game is plenty of fun on it's own.",True

"Don't buy this game, just get DC instead.

The sisters of battle, Dark Eldar, and flying units arn't worth the broken ass mechanics and retarded A.I.

Why do I say Broken? Because what the devs did is instead of making a more intelligent A.I is they punished the player. That is a big no-no. NEVER gimp the player just to make your game harder. 

Remember how in DC when you took land all the buildings you built would stay there, that way in case you got invaded they were there and ready? Kiss that goodbye. Now, once you take the land all your buildings are deleted. Why? Don't ask me, but it makes defensive battle exactly the same as offensive battles. But thats not all. Not ONLY are your bases whisked away as if they have other places to be after the battle, causing you to start every game from scratch, but the computer can START with 2 bases when THEY are attacking YOU! For what reason? Because the devs were to lazy to make a compitent system so they punish the player for playing the game. 

It becomes incredibly frustrating when you have JUST taken control of a place, only to have the computer counter-attack forcing you into the exact same battle exept worse because now the enemy will be constantly assulting you with endgame units before the clock hits 1 minute you preventing you from building your base up. This makes it very easy to become locked in place and unable to progress any further in your campaign 

One good part of this game is the strongholds. Every stronghold is sufficiantly unique and somewhat challenging, though some are rather annoying, like the eldar's hold. However these are also where the games storytelling comes in and it's absolute crap. [spoiler]For instance, when you take the Ork stronghold it tells you that Gorgutz ""somehow"" escapes. Somehow? SOMEHOW? Come on man give me some details! Did he have his mecboyz make him a makeshift spacecraft and call in the flash Gitz to pick him up? Did he disapear into the warp? Another exapmle is the necron intro. ""Nobody knows why the necrons awoke,"" What? Nobody knows? It seems like the Eldar know why they're there but according to the writers ""nobody knows?""[/spoiler] Who the hell wrote this stuff?

Aside from what I've wrote there are some odd audio glitches but other than that it's a pretty standard warhammer 40k game. If you have to make a choice between this and Dark Crusaide, get DC. It's better and more fair in every possable way.",False

"Killing Floor 2, oh boy where do I start with this game.  I was thinking that I would play more L4D2 but I have more hours in this game then L4D2 and that is because I feel that Killing Floor 2 offers more then L4D2 and I'll tell you why (oh and I am not shaming L4D2 in anyway, it's still a good game in it's own right).  The first thing is there are classes to play and each class has a certain perk to them and each 5 levels gives you a new upgrades to your perks, there are 2 upgrades but you can only pick one and some are just out right better then others and that's how it goes in games like these.  You like gore?  Well then this game is a great pick up for you, it's not huge huge gore but blood will pile up almost every where you shoot so there is that and the sound track is awsome to listen too and it's just so catchy to hear it whale you are killing zeds and such.

"Looks good, and runs smoothly - but that's about all it has going for it at the moment. The UI is difficult to get to grips with, inconsistent (to build one type of structure, you have to press F and then left mouse. To build another, left mouse, then press F) and breaks frequently. At one point everyone on our server lost their HUD, losing all map markers and becoming unable to interact with anything. Logging out and back in fixes it, but resets your spawnpoint compass and occassionally deletes your inventory as well. Moster AI is terrible, if they aggro to you they will chase you forever, even if you get long out of sight, eventually they'll catch up. Monsters spawn over and over in the same place, and occassionally these spawns move. We built our base in a safe area, got a couple of hours of building done and came off the game to have dinner. When we logged back in, giant crab monsters started spawning in the middle of our base, every 2 or 3 minutes - this never stoppped, so we had to restart.

It might be that there is a deep and rewarding game underneath the poorly polished UI and frustrating enemy spawns, but after 5 hours of pure frustration, which included logging out and restarting the game at least half a dozen times to fix broken UI bugs, I've had enough. Buy this if you're a masochist, otherwise wait until it is much, much further along in development.",False

"I don't review many games, but Transistor, much like SuperGiant's previous title, Bastion, exceeded my expectations on all fronts.

This game is a tremendously soulful piece of work, and from the very start to the very end, is first and foremost a work of art. The music, narration, artistic style and presentation flow together in a way that I would probably say outclasses almost any other game i've played. Anyone with a quibble of curiousity and a penchant for great games, or even works of art, should immediately purchase Transistor (AND Bastion) and enjoy the ride.

To touch on the gameplay itself, the combat is inventive and blends several previously done elements (pseudo-turn based combat, action queues, tactical-execution-based combat) into a pretty seamless and enjoyable experience. It is two parts arcade, one part strategic pause-and-think game. It remains fresh and has a lot of room for player creativity due to the openly configurable nature of abilities acquired throughout the game.

What follows are some brief pros/cons:

Pros:
+Incredible Art. From music to artwork, this entire game is a masterpiece.
+Gameplay. The combat remains fresh, enjoyable, and creative all the way through.
+Difficulty.  Like bastion, difficulty is born of modifiers you can apply to enemies, which give you bonuses for being brave.
+Storyline.  Again, this is a work of art and the storyline is rich, heartfelt, and incredibly immersive.
+Soundtrack.  Incredible, as usual.

Cons:
-Length.   The game itself isn't that long, although there are excuses to re-play the game with new conditions and toy around with the combat some more.

That's really all I can see anyone really griping about with this game.

In total, I'd give Transistor a 9.5/10, as one of the most absolutely awesome pieces of work i've seen in terms of gaming. It isn't a triple-A 40 hour experience... but it's an incredibly rich, artistic romp through an engaging and incredibly envisioned city of Cloudbank.

It still needs optimisation and polish as it just came out of early access, other than that it is a dream come true for every turn-based strategy fan.

"What Remains of Edith Finch is a good game with nice graphics and atmosphere. I think it was designed really well and was an interesting idea for a game. However I don't recommend it, although I realise I'm in the minority, and I don't really understand the almost universal praise it has been given!

My main issue is that it's not very interactive. Each to their own, but I wanted to explore my surroundings a bit more! Also, it felt a bit linear - since I wasn't able to interact with many objects in the game, I felt I was just being led to the next family member's story, rather than being able to find my own path. This made me feel pretty disconnected to the game and characters and reduced my overall enjoyment as I wasn't really immersed and invested in the game as much as I could have been. I was hoping for some more 'aha' moments I guess!

Some of the stories were well executed and presented in an interesting way, but I wasn't expecting certain depressing themes to feature in this game (e.g. Lewis' story). I felt like some of the stories were not as good, possibly even a little shallow and childish at times. 

It's a very short game too with a pretty high price tag, so I don't feel it was good value at all. There are some unanswered questions at the end but I think that's OK, that's life and you don't always get all the answers. Overall I finished the game feeling pretty unsatisfied.",False
"Very underrated game (In terms of how publicly spoken it is).
Pretty much a mix of Bioshock, System Shock and even Half-life to some degree.
It's more like a RPG than Shooter. So be warned that it might not be for you.

Immerssive, well optimized, and really good level design. 
You can approach problems in multiples ways, and you might even feel like you are breaking the game when reaching some place or approaching puzzles.

Not a lot of weapon diversity, but different tools and skills to deal with enemies the way you want.

"SICK!!!!!!!!!

It's overwhelming.  It's like the feeling of drowning.  Everything happens so fast and there's no time to think - it's just all pure reaction.  It's like swinging a bat but the pitcher is throwing hundreds of balls every second and the bat keeps swinging over and over and you feel a connection on every hit in a stream of continuous motion.  On top of all that, the maps come in many different shapes - some are 3D and some are flat with holes in them.

There's an ""adventure"" mode, which takes you through about 30 levels or so of maps with different geometries and challenges - they are sequential, and you can't go forward until you've beaten a boss for each map.  There is also a multiplayer mode which I haven't tried.  There's also an ""arcade"" mode, which has 6 variations: ""Deadline"", ""King"", ""Evolved"", ""Pacifism"", ""Waves"" and ""Retro Evolved"".  ""Waves Classic"" is my favorite: ""Score as much as you can with 1 life"".

There's also a ""Hardcore"" mode which is locked to begin with.

And there are also Bonus Levels.

The basic game-play is shoot stuff using 2 joysticks (one for movement and the other for gun direction).  After killing something, go collect the ""geodes"" they leave behind to get multipliers.  There are also smart-bombs and bonus gun modes after clearing out some map areas.  There might be other stuff too - I've just barely started playing this.

This game might not be for everyone - it is about-as-eye-candy-as-things-can-get with so much moving around on the screen.

When the screen is FULL of stuff and you have NO IDEA how you are still alive and all of it is pure REFLEX and INTUITION - it's quite a feeling.  I don't think I've ever experienced a feeling like this from a video-game!  I actually found myself shouting at the screen while playing - it was such an overwhelming feeling.  It's like half-way between wishing it was over, and watching a miracle taking place.  :)

If you're waiting for this to go on sale - are you really sure about that?  Couldn't you skip dinner?  Don't get a haircut?  Buy canned beans for a month?  I mean.. are you sure you really want to wait?  I think this is a steal at full price.",True
"Although I would recommend it to, I would only recommend it to the ones that, firstly, don't rage as much, as this game gets very frustrating sometimes. Secondly, the ones that can endure pain comparable to Dark Souls (if one doesn't know the basic fighting techniques). For a game that had such little budget, it is impeccable (in my opinion). There are so many small secrets and the character design is great, I always like going into games as if it was actually happening to me, so I acted as all the characters I was actually friends with. This really got me toward the end [spoiler] when I was forced to kill Yzan due to poor choices. [/spoiler] There is a large jump in challenge in different regions, after completing the game I went back to Chersonese and found that everything was extremely easy. The soundtrack is also absolutely amazing, with my favourite track being the one for the Hallowed Marsh. Now for some small criticism that I think isn't too important but would really make the game better, there are two occasions I have found in which it happens, but in-game fighting, when the (small spoiler) [spoiler] war breaks out between Levant and the Blue Chamber, Levant starts by being in Enmerkar, however, you don't see a large battle scene anywhere, you are told it isn't safe but nothing changes [/spoiler]. Also you can't sit on chairs or order any beverages from the inns. That's really it, I like the game and think that it's a hard, realistic fantasy (as realistic fantasy can get) RPG that has a lot of lore, content and exploration.",True

"Ok I have some hours in this game and it is fun. I really do like this game all but for one crucial part of the game, the building system. The issue with building is simple the way the game is set up if you remove a piece that is mirrored to the other side you will never get that one piece back as it was. I have tried time and tim again to build in this game and it just never works out. 

So if you are like me and like to build some of your own ships this may not be a game for you. The reason is as you advanced in the game you will have to add things to your ship. So you start your build leaving room on the inside for advancement right. Well then you take a piece off to see inside. Well that piece will never go back to that same spot so your  ship will never look right again. This throws everything off and it really can not be avoided. Atleast not if you build with anything but square blocks. 

This is the big issue with this game I have and I hate it. Keeps me from enjoying the game at all. Empyrion and Space engineers have a much better build system that makes building fun. There needs to be something done in this game to make things easier to remove a piece for a moment and then get it back just as it was. Until that happens I will not recommend this game as the building in my opinion is broken. 

Also you should note if you have a low end PC and Empyrion and Space Engineers will not work on your PC then this is the game for you. It is so so simplistic in graphics that it should easily run on low end PC.",False

"Metro Last Light 

Genre	Action/Post-apocalyptic
Campaign	Yes
Game length	10 - 12 hours
Difficulty modes	3
Based on	""Metro series""

- Metro Last Light. The sequel to the game Metro 2033 which was based off the same book by Dmitry Glukhovsky, Last Light takes a bit of an unexpected turn. Instead of following the plot of the book the first one was based on's sequel, Metro 2034, the developers with assistance of the author came up with their own plot for this game, due to the fact that Metro 2034 is apparently not very gameworthy. Like 2033, it was rereleased for the new gen consoles as well as PC, providing new graphics and some other minor tweaked things.

Story/Atmosphere
You once again play as Artyom, who, since the last game, has become a Ranger. He is sent out one day to investigate the ruins of the Dark One's former home, where there are reports of a young Dark One still living there. While there, Artyom is captured by the Nazi faction and escapes with his new ally Pavel, a Red soldier who says he will help Artyom get to a neutral station and get him to the Dark One. Things end up not going as planned, but I won't get into that because spoilers. The story goes a bunch of different directions, all of which keep you interested in going on with it. It's a pretty good story, a lot better than 2033, which is saying a lot. The endings are the same basic idea; you get or lose morality points throughout the game, which will affect which ending you get depending on how many you have. I've seen both, and it's worth going for the morally good ending since the bad one... it's kind of depressing. xD They also go into the history of the Metro and add some neat lore into there, which is pretty neat. Overall the story is excellent.

Gameplay
The game is very similar to Metro 2033, which is not a bad thing at all since it is good. Gunplay is good, and they have some more gunfights, which can get really tense. There was one battle where I had fought against this boss animal and when the battle was over I was out of normal ammo and had to resort to using military grade rounds, which are more damage efficient but they're better used to save up and buy ammo and guns. Stealth gameplay is pretty good as well and it's a good alternate to going in guns blazing when you can do it, though it does show that the AI is a bit... lacking. It is a bit better than the original version, but I still get some moments that I scratch my head and wonder, ""How the heck did he not see me?"" The surface levels from 2033 make a return, where you have to use a gas mask and air filters to be able to stay up there for longer than a minute without suffocating. They're fun like last time and are a nice change from the narrow metro tunnels. Overall the gameplay is fun.

Graphics & Performance
The game looks pretty dang good. The metro tunnels look gritty and the outside environments are breathtaking to look out. The game played well on my rig, though it had some lower FPS on the later levels, though I think it was more because of my crappy rig and if you have a good system you shouldn't have any problems.
- I think one of the reasons M:LL is so amazingly immersive and delivers such a fantastic atmosphere is largely due to the lighting. It's flat out gorgeous. The lightbeams from friendly and hostile npcs and mounted lights, combined with the fantastic fog/smoke effects makes for an impressive sight. Especially when you take into account the moisture on your gas mask, the ambient lighting and the flares.

Characters & Voice acting
The voice acting quality from the last game carries over to this one. There are mostly Russian accents in the game, though some German ones for some members of the Nazi factions, and I think the only way you can make it feel more authentic is if you had them only speak Russian, which you can actually set up in the options with subtitles of whatever language you ne
ed, but I'm fine with the English dubbing, thank you very much. :P Artyom still doesn't speak outside of the game, which is pretty awkward and interesting in same time. A lot of characters from the last game, like Khan and Miller, are in here as well and do some neat stuff. There's also a female sniper named Anna who you, kind of randomely the more I think of it, start a romantic relationship with. They're all fine though characterwise, so I won't be mad for that.

Conclusion
- Metro Last Light is certainly worth a look if you like first person shooters, apocalyptic, adventure and creepy games. It provides a strong story line directly connected to 2033, a wonderful atmosphere to experience, smooth controls, stunning visual graphics and sounds. This was my second favorite game that came out in 2013 (my number one being GTA5 for all those who were curious), it's a really good game and you should check it out sometime soon as well as 2033. Both are pretty good.",True

"This game is the definition of ""omg im such a scorpio"" and stepping on the gas and gunning it down a stretch of freeway at 80MPH with traffic.

I don't even have a driver's license in real life. Well, not YET at least. This was on sale for $5, so I'd figured it get it just to see what truck driving is like.

And I honestly love it. I don't know if it's just because I can't drive IRL and I find driving in game to be fun, or if its the sight-seeing and simulation of taking these huge road trips just to deliver some cargo. Either way, its really enjoyable and even relaxing. I can't comment on how accurate the driving is to real life, since I don't know how a truck operates (and I am only using keyboard and mouse, not a wheel and other accessories), so if your going to buy it for that, I'd consult another review or just look it up if I were you.

I enjoyed this so much, I even bought almost all of the DLC just to see the other states. Doing those big drives from Washington State down to Nevada is just really enjoyable and I can't really put my finger on why.
The game does look a little dated tho, but its a simulation game so I won't knock it too hard for that. It's just a great experience. overall.

"First of all, this game should be called The Cave instead of The Forest because the probability of getting lost inside those humongous caves are high, and we probably spend more time getting lost inside the caves instead of those forests. 

I enjoy every aspect of the game, but to be honest, I feel like The Forest is lacking in crafting and building. I know that's not necessary since the goal is finding 'Nemo', but I believe more options in crafting will make this game even more better (and complicated).

But overall, those who enjoy any other survival games will most likely enjoy The Forest as well.

All of the dialogue flows along while you are creeping through the dark atmospheric tunnels of an abandoned spaceship.

As a big metroidvania AND roguelike fan, I was extremely wary of any attempt to blend the two genres.

"Verdun is a trench warfare simulator. Ever wanted to escape the fast paced heroism of games like COD or Battlefield? Ever wanted to know what it's really like to be in the trenches? Ever want to see a game that pushes the limits of the balance between realism and fun? Well, prepare to get your teeth kicked in and your intestines blown out, because this game is for you. This game is hardcore. It's brutal, panic inducing, and relentlessly realistic. You're not a super soldier, you're a guy. You reload slow, you'll find yourself struggling to use your gun in the heat of the moment, you'll get killed more times than you can count. This game will not hold your hand. This game will not ask you to press X to not die. This game will not forgive you for your mistakes. Someone once asked me to explain this game in a sentence. ""Hide in a hole and pray"" I told him. 

Mechanically, this game gets it right, and, interestingly, it's one of the only games I've played where its particular brand of ""indie jankiness"" actually serves to the game's advantage. Barbed wire feels broken, and I don't really understand how it works, which works for the game beacause getting trapped in wire in the war usually meant your ass. The guns never do, but they feel like they could just fall apart in your hands any second. Movement is kinda awkward, and so are the guns. It's tough to tell what is and isn't intentional, but all of it works within the context of the game, which is either impressive or lazy; possibly both. 

So, if you've got a couple of bucks, buy it.

I will now spend the rest of this review complaining about what's changed since I bought the game in 2015.

So, in the last year, it's clear that the devs have tried really hard to appeal to a wider audience. I can respect that; the community has always been kinda small, and I understand that these guys gotta make a living. It just seems to me, though, that the game has changed since the old days of Verdun, and not for the better. Like, voice chat. Now, I get why people like that, but this game has always been more slow paced game, and I liked the fact that you could only talk by typing because ir made damn sure that the only things said were things worth saying. See, the voice chat is indicative of the fact that they're trying to make this game more fast paced. You can pick your spawn now, you can tell when and where artillery is coming, loadouts are less diverse and getting one thing in your loadout doesn't really require you to sacrifice something else. There's bots now, so each kill is no longer a major achievement, but something to be expected. The game is just... less hardcore and less unique than it once was. I don't know. Maybe it's me. Maybe I'm too stuck in my ways. I earned my way to being good at this game, and it took getting killed enough times that the ghosts of my dead characters could double the population of Brooklyn. The servers hold 64 players now, not 32, so you're more likely to encounter an enemy, which means the old days of thoughtfully and carefully planning your next move has been replaced by charging to where the action is and hoping for the best. There's no small games with 10 or 20 players anymore. It just seems like they're trying to be more like the popular games, which sucks. We have those games. This game was great because it was nothing like other shooters. It was nothing like anything anybody had EVER played before, and its uniqueness was its greatest strength.

Don't get the idea that this game isn't good or that I don't still love it. It still beats BF1 by a mile in every meaningful way. I still love this game with all my heart. It's just that it feels like the devs aren't embracing what makes this game so great: the fact that there's no experience in gaming quite like Verdun.",True

"Now this is a really nice game!

The gameplay is really similar to Talisman (oh rly?), which is a good thing, since Talisman is a good tabletop game.

It's pretty easy to learn to play (I learned it in my very first match, with the tutorials and tips that appear mid-game), and it's really fun!

You start with your Warlord and must strengthen yourself and your forces, through many ""event cards"", equipaments, troops, fleets, or through combat experience, when you defeat an enemy. You may also fight against enemy Warlords, if you get in the same sector (place) as them.

You must get a Talisman through a quest you get in one specific Sector, and get strong enough to fight your way to The Vengeful Spirit, the place where the final battle will take place.

You will have to defeat Horus, if you're Loyalist - or The Emperor, if you're a Traitor.

One of my favorite features of this game, it's the possibility to play hotseat with any number of players you want, AND with the AI. The Online Multiplayer is also a good thing.

Don't mind the dlc. Yeah, it's day one DLC, which is never a good thing, but I really think it's unnecessary to have it.
It just adds 2 Warlords for each faction, and some dataslates (cards). The base game already have plenty of both.

So, if you like Talisman, tabletop games, or even if you just like Warhammer 40k, get this game and have some good fun!",True

Wargame Red Dragon is an awesome game and it is a game for people who like to play strategic games. The only things I think needs to be add and only add is that they should get aircraft carriers that cost like 600 or 700 points. And they should  make it so boats that have heli pads can have helicopters land on them instead of having to go to shore and if there is a cargo ship in the area (within resupply area)  the helicopters should be ably to resupply. They also should add oil rigs that are FOBs or resupply bases so the cargo ships can resupply. Right now I would rate this game a 4.7 out of 5. Its a great game and I enjoy playing it.,True

"Wow. Have only played 20 minutes on this game, but this is what I was always looking for in VR. Think Zelda in style, going around collecting gems and loot with a flame torch in one hand and a sword in the other

The teleport system that is being used with VR seems solid... but with games like this, that looks so convincing in VR, I just want to walk and walk and walk. It would be cool to see some kind of game design that employs Unseen Diplomacy’s technique of room control. Anyway, that is more a criticism of how unbelievably convincing VR is, and how much of a shame it is when you see the Chaperone Boundaries come up.
If you are new to the Vive, buy this now. Best game I have played on it yet, and actually feels like a game rather than a tech demo.

EDIT:

Chapter 2 is dreadful... it really left a sour taste in my mouth to the entire experience. Gone is the wonderful RPG exploration with puzzles, in is a battle area with time limit. It feels like the poorest excuse of level padding and it really wasn't fun. When it gets to the end, I wasn't even sure it was the end and wasted lots of time trying to find out what I have to do next. I really want to see the dev change this, otherwise this review will turn to negative once the game leaves EA.

EDIT 2 (in Progress

The update has made the combat much much harder and much more fun. Unfortuatly you can beat the game by crouching (the AI can't cope with it). Vast improvement in smashable objects and little puzzles (such as throwing rocks to knock down goblets etc). This update puts me back in positive mind set about the Developer, although I am not looking forward to ""chapter 2""... hopefully it has also been updated in a good direction.

If you have already played this game before the update, get stuck back in right now!",True

"For fans of Visual Novels like Clannad or Katawa Shoujo, this one is pretty fantastic. Characters are great, background art is fantastic, and the dialogue audio for the characters is very professionally done. I only have two issues, which I don't even really consider issues; Some of the dialogue has been translated oddly, not so much wrong, but more like they just left some typos in the text, nothing game breaking of course.
And my next issue is it's not the game in it's entirety, there is a free patch for download online that restores the game to how its sold in Japan, (Hentai scenes and all, if you're into that) this came as a bummer to me because I was already 15 hours into the story. Anyway,

"At last a worthy Warhammer 40K game!
Inquisitor martyr is not just another RTS it's the next generation rts and many will follow it's kind. 
Pros:
-Sandbox-MMO ARPG.
-Awesome graphics .
-Spectacular sound effects, music, animations.
-Very interesting story line with cinematics.
-Enjoyable co-op f@#$k yeah!
-Many classes-subclasses 
-Amazing talent-skill tree with unlimited different kind of builds.
-Abilities depend on what weapons you use, you have global abilities like jumpacks if u are an assault or deploy turrets and among many other you've got stim packs!! i mean what else can you ask in a 40k game if not the stimpack a cigar and a heavy bolter to serve lead to the unclean!!!
-Very careful designed maps (statues-walls etc) and everything can be taken down!
-Vehicles!
-Fatalities omg!
-Creators announced that every 3 months for free they are going to release new storylines.
-Unique items.
-Unique paint colors to customize your character.
-No f@#%#g endgame meta builds, anyone can have an endgame build he likes and be valid.
-Randomly generated maps with hundred of different enemies to purge and boss fights were you need to use your human brain to win and not just click.
-You can decide the difficulty on the maps.
-New mini campaigns every day with mini rpg stories and a decision making system.
-Huge crafting but simple at the same time system with many active and passive skills. 
But most of all everytime you play you have a sense of being in the WH40k universe, at last someone nailed it.
Cons
-Maybe the price but it's definetly worth it. This is a masterpiece.

"[h1][b]o7 o7 [i]Warning! Opinions ahead, I reserve the right to be disagreed with in an amicable fashion.[/i] o7 o7[/b][/h1] 

I cant recommend this game. it is a profound time sink, and has a really niche player base with very little payoff for more casual players. I played for about a year and i found myself waiting for the game experience to become fun, but it never did. the space combat is unforgivably boring, which as far as im concerned is a deal breaker. 

the ship designs are bizarrely ugly too, and it constantly tempered my desire for new ships. i care less about aesthetics than combat, but playing this i was forced to stare at my ship for virtually the entire playtime, so i would have been happier if i actually liked how my ships looked. 

the skill system was pretty much hands-off, you just had to wait for hours or more commonly days or even weeks to get a miniscule increase to a particular skill, and it never felt rewarding to max a skill out, just on to the next skill, a numb grind.

i realize that many people would cite the massive battles that occur as a counter to my assertion that the combat is boring, but these huge battles are infrequent at best, and due to the in-game economy being so closely linked to real world cash value, these battles could very well cost you more than a few wrecked ships. most of the time youll be battling human or a.i. controlled pirates/bandits in small time skirmishes that serve only to highlight how uninteresting the combat usually is.

 i keep a book by my computer for when im downloading programs or whatever, and i found myself rereading the entire Song of Ice and Fire series while engaged in combat or mining, both primarily rely on the same skill set of moving the mouse icon and occasionally clicking buttons. 

i also grew to mistrust the company CCP and the community of this game, although im sure there were lots of decent human beings amongst them. the biggest problem i had with the community happened when i first started playing. the leader of one of the most prominent corporate alliances had shown up to a livestream drunk and called out a player by his real name and asked his followers to grief this poor, totally innocent guy. the leader said during the livestream that he wanted the player to actually commit suicide irl, and the big bad leader was marshalling his ingame forces to ""make it so"".

this despicable behaviour was reprimanded with a slap on the wrist, a mere 30 day suspension from their little ingame council, and as far as i know, nothing more was done.

 there seemed to be a lingering resentment towards players who choose to pve or mine or whatever, and i read more than a few forum posts that were more like essays on how the elitist players are right in how they grief players who choose to mine, likening them to worse than mindless drones that deserve to die over and over. it felt like i was reading the manifesto of a sociopath, rather than a reasoned sensible opinion.

there is so much more to say, but i cant realistically place all that i have to say in a single review, who would be interested in reading it?",False

"Amazing, in-depth, a mind-challenging concept, and horror. Frictional Games are far from shy when it comes to horror games, and with this new take on a deeply philosophical story, they really hit it hard and well.
You are Simon Jarrett, a survivor of a car crash who goes in for a brain scan and finds himself in a place a bit out of the ordinary. Traveling through the depths of the ocean, you try to save the remnants of humanity while tackling monsters created by a cancerous growth-like AI, and find conflict within yourself, and your character.

The thoughts of ""what makes a human, human"" and ""if you were copied into another body, would you still be you"", are deep thoughts that aren't commonly thought about in daily life. SOMA is a truly horrifying, thoughtful experience.

"I initially gave PUBG a positive review, I am now changing that to a 'Do Not Recommend'.

Back then I gave this game the benefit of the doubt - being early access, acquiring funds, building player-base size etc, all while keeping in mind that whatever problems that occurred were nuances to the final release. 
Boy was I wrong. Since then PUBG has established itself as a company that could rival many AAA studios, with a ridiculous amount of growth in such little time and the funds to make light work of any issues (known and upcoming) but alas with each month that passes I find more reasons not to launch this game.

The most recent issue and one that has prompted this change in review is the Hackers, second to that is the lack of optimisation; actually they both sit equally as issues that are ruining the game for me. 
My system doesn't suffer nowhere near as much as others but coming from a game of Squad or dare I say Fortnite I instantly realise that PUBG runs so poorly. 

Now I'm no expert on the topic or even how game optimisation works but I'm sitting here like everyone else skimming the release notes and the priority to make PUBG run at a seamless and smooth competitive 'e-sports' level is almost like watching grass grow. Negatives aside the game is fun when it works (usually when there are only 40 people left in a server) but for now I would wait on some solid optimisation work before dropping coin on this.",False

When compared to the sims 3, it lacks lots of customization of furniture, and due to the lack of selection... makes it very bland... the same goes for floor coverings, window treatments etc etc...

"Timespinner is a Metroidvania game that seems to be heavily inspired by Symphony of the Night, Order of Ecclesia and Aria of Sorrow, though it falls a long way short of emulating these games.

Timespinner is not without it's merits, though: The game looks incredible and the soundtrack is also very good. It also makes a very good first impression and after two hours I thought I was playing a great game (that was also tastefully playing homage to a great series). However, as I progressed further, it became clear that the actual game design was much weaker than the (amazing) audiovisual design. In short, the main flaws are that:

1) Lunais levels up far too quickly,
2) Many of the orbs (the weapons used in the game) have redundant effects,
3) The various areas, while they have their own unique look, feel identical to play.

As a result, the challenge quickly disappeared from the game and it devolved into a tedious experience of doing the same things over and over again.

In short, it feels like the developer understands how a good Metriodvania should look but doesn't really understand what makes a Metroidvania game great. It also feels like Timespinner was rushed to completion given how poorly balanced the game is.

All that being said, Timespinner isn't a bad game, but it's also not a good game and it's impossible to recommend at this price point, given that it's the same price as Hollow Knight. It could become worthy of consideration in a sale, though I would not recommend it unless it was available at 75% off.",False

Early Access review;

My first Early Access game, I've had nothing but a blast so far. Open world, specializing skills, tame and ride dinosaurs and even defecate. 
Devs work their asses off with bring the community content every week with constant updates, not for the money but for the enjoyment of creating a game and seeing people have fun. If you wish to see a certain dinosaur or prehistoric creature in the game, best chances it will be added if it hasn't been confirmed already.

Post Launch Review;

Everything I said about this game above was ture for the first year of Early Access. Since then my view about the game and the developers behind the game has changed dramaically. This game is not worth the price hike. It's not worth the 60$ in it's current state.

After the honeymoon phase I have come to dislike this game more and more. Nothing foundationally has changed since Early Access and some how this game plays worse than it did a year ago. I have a pretty high end computer, that according to the store page and in game default settings, my rig should be more than enough to play on high settings. They have yet to address the memory leak and a pethora of glitches and bugs that have been in the game since day one. The constant CTDs due to memory being eaten up has imbittered me. Undermeshing is the new flavor of the month and they have done little to fix it. 

WildCard would rather add new shiny things into the game instead of fixing the broken foundation. They should have never ported this to switch or mobile either. It's buggy and unoptomized regardless of platform. They allocated their human resources in all the wrong areas of development and the state that Extinction released in really shows that they lost their way since early EA. I was a idiot to think this game would be fully optomized and smooth post launch. After two years of EA, I regret defending it on the forums.

I will admit I had fun in EA with some great friends, but I can NOT recommend this game until they fix the foundation, and I will not buy any more games made by Instinctgame/WildCard/GrapeShot until these problems are fixed aswell.",False

"10/10 get hollow knight if you have a tolerance for difficulty and getting lost (treat this like a souls game).

Besides the above two things, I genuinely cannot think of a single negative thing to say about Hollow Knight. Those two things are also major strengths and by design. 

-The visuals, music, and theme are fantastic. You are a bug in a bug kingdom that's going downhill. Everything is just really pretty with some really good music.

-The bosses are difficult but in a good way. They have very distinct attack patterns but there's plenty of challenge.

-This is the only world that can rival Dark Souls. There is so much to explore with tons of implicit lore, hidden areas, bosses, NPCs, loot, etc. This game is insanely immersive. 

-The gameplay is really tight. The combat and movement are crisp and there are areas with the most hardcore parkour you'll ever find. Search up the Path of Pain as an example. 

-The endgame is insanely fulfilling and appropriately challenging. 

-There are really fun tools and abilities at your disposal. They're all very useful. With pins (basically buffs) you can create new builds on the fly. You can also upgrade certain aspects like your weapon or spells. 

-The only downsides are that you might get lost at some points and not know where to go/ lacking an item you may need. Another one is just getting frustrated if you get stuck. If you like the souls games, get this.",True

"Review: v.183

Pacing is already very well understood in the early game. Challenge is constant and the pressure is precise. This game feels very deliberate in it's tone, and using ""lower end"" graphical quality but playing with saturation makes the entire expereince mesmerizing. Only piece missing for me was a soundtrack, but absence also makes it compelling.

I know if you're reading this, survival games out there have not quite yet scratched that itch. This comes so damn close. Here's hoping they can make it work.",True

Tough, but generally fair, and the unfair bits are not too big of a deal as you can just start a new run if things get too past the point of no return.

"An adorable adventure game. There's no combat aside from knocking out guards, and they get back up in a few seconds. It's mostly stealth, but the guards don't see that well, and they chase slowly, so it's not Thief or Styx. Most of the ""challenge"" so far has just been finding things for fetch quests, which unfortunately could be a little better. There's no waypoints or markers, just exploration, and some hints or clues about where you might want to head next.

Strangely this game gives off Dark Souls vibes to me. Not in the way of combat obviously, but in the level design that has a tendency to bend back on itself and create shortcuts for further exploration.

It's fun, but if you don't want to scrub every pixel to find all the hidden stuff, get a waklthrough ready.",True

"Every game these days you have to do crazy cheese and exploits (shouldnt have to kite 1000000000000 millions zombies with one archer just to cheese them with your one executor or what ever.....). no casual gamer should play this.have to sweat and have an APM of 12 million to even play the game or even unlock new maps. 
some people dont have trillions of hours to burn on a map only to lose to some crazy rush of zombies because they wanted to casually play. and u cant do ANYTHING if u are a casual gamer.

Most games suffer from this ,and as a result become less fun,because its not about fun. its about finding the best tactic and having the highest apm known to man kind.......
just as bad as starcraft and other games, sucks all fun out of the game unless u are a super sweaty competitive gamer. 

4/10, wouldnt recomend to anyone who just wants to enjoy a game for the simple factor of playing a game to enjoy..unless u like being stuck on campaign with no changing variables because the enemy can just throw itself at you endlessly with no regards for parameters exepct straight to ur town hall .Poor game development and shotty AI programing, its easy to program a bot to attack anything in its path and just go straight for your town hall. no thought factord in at all..this game is not for anyone who wants to have fun unless u just enjoy being a cheese fest and cheesing everything . its extremely rare you get to actually defend by build .90% of the time u just kite the 10k zombies with one archer and a tower around in circles while the just chase your archer and ur tower gets free damage. u rarley ever feel like your builds are even close to reliable even if u rush and power swarm that said structure.",False

"This game was everything I had hoped it would be and THEN MORE.  

Combat:
Fluid, easy to learn. Fun to level up

Weapons:
Lots of weapons, very fun to toy with them all and find a good couple to match your play style

Graphics:
Not bad, it's a tad dated but it still holds a fantasy feel with some kind of cartoonish look, somewhat like what borderlands does.

Smithing:
Fantastic, easy to use, and you can get some amazing kinds of gear from it.

Exploration:
Always fun, loot is rendomized so you never find the same thing in the same place no matter how many playthroughs you do.

Questing:
9/10 of the entirety of the quests in this game are great and the monotonous ones are few and far between. The quests are engaging and informative of the story

General:
The world is magnificent, filled with aweing magical ley sparkles and with a great soundtrack to boot. there are a handful of races but a ton of lore on each. the world is vibrant and always full of life, and it reacts to the changes you've made to the world. Loot is always plentiful. 

Roleplaying:
This game is RICH with roleplay potential, you can be a paladin using heals and light magic to do good, or you can be a shady rogue that wipes out a village, you can be the anti-hero mercenary thats in it for the money. this game is chalk FULL of goodies for the common RPer.

Encounters:
Fun and engaging, somewhat dimwitted, but there are a lot with decent AI.

Final note:
This game is worth it, the variety in armor,weapons,and spells are fantastic. The game itself is quite and adventure in a cliche fantasy world that'll be JUST what you're looking for and THEN some. I have yet to beat the game I just keep making new Characters and I've yet to get bored of it.

"A perfect game. 10/10 
The musical score is extremely fitting and enjoyable to listen to. Yes, I am a Gabe fan. The ambiance and sounds in this game are very well done or truly terrifying. 
From hearing a trap go off to shrieking in pain to sticking your walkman to a tree, it becomes a thing of beauty. Inventory is unique. 
You really feel like the person wielding the axe as the movement of the attacks is based entirely on you. It's life or death if a mistake is made.  
There are a lot of things you don't expect that can happen and it adds to already high suspense. 
The open world is large. 
Crafting is fun.
The weaponry is varied. 
The enemies are fearsome.
No spoilers here. 
As well, you don't have to do the objectives; you can just live day and night trying to survive. 
The duels in particular are realistic and labored. This kind of edge of your seat horror is imo, is what makes playing this alone so creepy. I mean, i've played RE4 and 5 but in that one you go through each stage. Whereas, here its really up to you to decide what's next. There's personal stats and a lot of things u can build. 
I do have a few comments on bugs. (all minor) 
1) the arrow and slingshot is perfect. the spear, however, when im aiming it, it always goes 3 notches higher than I was looking at. This is exacerbated on hills, where it can go 4-5 notches higher. basically i have to look at the ground in order to shoot something in front of me, but then i can't see them (because im looking down ). If the developers read this, please fix this! ! I think the spear needs to be re-calibrated. i wonder if anyone else feels the same way. 
2) when crafting fence, u can't connect two separate walls. its hard to break walls after being created and then u have to start all over and build a single wall, perfectly. i get particularly creative when building defenses and i don't like leaving gaps in them. 
3) you cannot place rugs on the floor of the cabin. if you try, then it will go underneath the cabin floor. I don't want to put rabbit skin on the walls! 
4) I'm not sure if the catapult is entirely useful?? enemies move too quickly. 
That said, the enemies are just scary as hell. There will seldom be an opportunity to attack while you are constantly harassed. Death is imminent. Patience is a useful tool but when attacked in numbers have fun. 
If you're into horror/survival/crafting then this is a thriller.",True

"This is by far one of the best games I've played. Unlike Valve, Facepunch has spent the last few years developing this amazing survival game and listening to the commmunity, not just updating the sounds.  I'm honestly suprised at how Facepunch is willing to put up with the whining the community has thrown at them over the past years while they practicaly gave them what they wanted. If you end up getting bored, which I doubt you will, there are multiple different server types you can play on such as builder (build whatever you want with unlimited materials, no pvp), Hunger Games, etc. Ever since the very early alpha (before experimental), the game has been very enjoyable to play, and it's mindblowing how far it has come. I can't wait for the full release, and support facepunch all the way. Don't listen to the reviews from salty players who just got killed in game. It is honestly great and if you are in a server with assholes, just find a different one.",True

Edge scrolling is the only way to move around the map and you constantly keep going farther than you mean to. The menu to select things feels very unintuitive.

"Upon reflection on how enjoyable Fallout 1 is, it's easy to see why it took off and why it was Hot IP for Bethesda to buy up when they got the chance. This game is a VERY OLD RPG and thusly, is more strategic. It isn't just point gun at man until man falls down, it's more complex in some ways.
I definitely like that this game pushes you to build a character properly and not just think ""eh I'll make up for my lack of Endurance later"", dump stats are actually something that might be detrimental, your lack of endurance might be fine early on when the average enemy is as much of a threat to you as an agitated baked bean but later on you'll be utterly screwed because oh yeah, health is a function of endurance!

In one game, my friend and I ran into a team that pretended to be cowboys that were yelling ""YEEEEE HAAAAA"".   It's this sort of humor in a tense game that makes it an absolute blast to play.

There are also bosses that are pretty difficult without the right set up but once killed, gives a lot money.

"Well at nearly three hours in I can honestly say this is the best VR experience I've had so far. The game is 100% Skyrim - *but you are there*. 
 Pros:
Fantastic optimisation with everything on max, including max supersampling. It plays flawlessly and is one of the best looking VR titles out there despite being an old game ported up.
Controls are very good for a VR title. The devs have actually play tested them and picked schemes that are practical.
Crouching to stealth while cutting through spider webs and hearing your sword ""zwoosh"" gently through the air!
All of the DLC so a ridiculous amount of content. 
By everything holy if two handing 'Sparks' the electric magic attack isnt the most fun thing you have done in VR !! It sends physics items spinning to infinity while you cackle !

Cons:
 There is nothing new, its just Skyrim all over again.
 Moving around with smooth movement sometimes gets you caught on scenery but with this much scenery I cant blame the developers too much for not checking every square cm.
While magic is awesome, bow are fantastic melee is like hitting someone with wet celery (but does have a good swishy sound).

"Endless Space 2 is the most visually and audibly beautiful of the modern Space 4X's (on Spotify, my favorites are ""Sophons Prologue"" and ""Light Curve"").

The main selling point for me is that the developer was extremely bold when differentiating races.  It's not just that one race is a little better at industry while another is better at science:
- One race can found an outpost in any unoccupied system with just currency (no colony ship)
- One race slowly grows ""vines"" to systems, and can then immediately colonize any planet covered in vines (skipping over the outpost stage)
- One race doesn't eat food and hates planets vibrant with life
- One race puts all its people in giant ships, and those people each harvest all the planets in a system simultaneously (ignoring planet size completely)
- One race ""harvests"" generic material from other races and uses it to improve their own race

"I literally built the computer I currently use just to play Rome II, so you may wish to take this review with a grain of salt. Also, please note that this is about five months after release, and the game has had several major patches. 

Initially, I didn't buy this game because of how buggy it was reported to be. Many videos went up displaying the bugs, some even before release. After three patches, and a lot of searching for newer reviews and commentaries, I decided it would be safe to pick up the game (and it was half off :D)

The game is a masterpiece. It is visually stunning on my mid-level PC, and it has so much depth. Creative Assembly broadened the game immensely from Rome I; there are dozens more units in the Roman faction, the tech system is many times better than in previous Total Wars, the units seem to have individual soldiers processed, and the entire interface is very streamlined. While there are some features I sorely miss from Rome I, such as individual city population and not needing a general in each army, the changes improved the strategy to a large extent.

In Rome I, the game felt like a big canopy painted with strokes, a brilliant work in its own right. Rome II feels more like pointalism, with each tiny detail scrutinzed and unified to form a beautiful and intricate picture. While Rome I is better, Rome II is absolutely worth your time. I do, however, recommend purchasing and playing Rome I first, if you haven't. It's cheaper and a quicker play. Also, if you get either Rome TW, don't buy the others unless you adore the series or you prefer another time period.

I am so glad I waited and got it when I did. It is very likely that the game would have been ruined by the bugs upon release, and I wouldn't look back. If you were hesitant before, get it now; if you jumped on and left before, try it again.",True

"A radical MMO but not a real MMO.

.Hack//G.U. Last Recode is collection of the .Hack G.U. trilogy, plus a new 4th entry made for this re-release.
Is it worth it? Yes. The first 3 games are each a good 20-25 hours of playtime if your doing nothing but the main story, with the 4th game being roughly 3-4. (more on this later), there's also something called ALMINT mode which is world building and lore that you unlock more of as you progress, last a parody mode where the voice actors essentially get a different script during noteworthy cutscenes.

Some quick things to note: No, you don't need to play any previous .Hack game to have fun and get into it.
Yes, it will spoil the plot summary's of previous games, however its completely avoidable (ALMINT mode is the only place that spoils anything.)
And no, Sword Art Online did not come first.

Gameplay wise, each of the games stay relatively the same, you have a 3 man party in a 3D space in a RPG fashion, you run through dozens of area's collecting, fighting, and running across to reach the end, head back to town for various reasosns, fight in a arena, do some bullet hell laser fights, then some minigames and lore here or there.
Each entry forward makes improvements as you go along, so any weird clunky moments you may find early on, wont be around your entire adventure. All this being said, the game does have some variety issues with in terms of its locales. Each town has a different theme, however the dungeons you through stay mostly the same from each game. I didn't personally mind it, but if your someone who likes a nice change of pace in locations when you play your games, you'll be left with something to desire.
There's a convert data option that lets you keep all of your items and stats into each game, so its more rewarding if you want to go from game 1-4.
If your a returning or long time fan, there's a cheat mode for every game that gives you all the best stuff in the game so you can just ride along and enjoy the story, but I wouldn't recommend this for new players unless they were determined to skip the first game. Whats also noteworthy, none of the games are very hard.
So long as your not avoiding every fight you come across, its a simple run through. if there is a harder option, I didn't check. For a collection of games in one package, i don't really mind either, there's a lot of ground to cover I'd hate to get stuck on something for long knowing I'd still have 3 more games to play.
Visual, its aged, whereas once the visuals were shining with the best of us back in 2006, they show their age but its never to the point of gamebreaking.
How good are the plots? Very nice actually. I expected your average edgelord anime dude meets gamer girl getting pushed along for the ride, but each game does a nice job on showing who the characters are, what they bring to the table, give them stakes that matter making you care, and lastly making them develop as characters as you play through each game. (eat your heart out SAO)
If I had to rank any of them for things like story or game play, Volume 2 would be the best in terms of climax, building to its final chapter, whereas Volume 3 feels like a fully completed game.

Now the big question, Volume 4.
what is it? Its a short sequel to volume 3, picking up a year later after the original trilogy ends. Yes its canon, and yes its only about 3-4 hours long. 
Its clear it was made as a love letter to its players as it just screams fan service people had in the back of their head since 2007. most features from volume 3 are removed for this title since the purpose was soley focus on the story, so things like minigames, arena battles, your bike, weapon crafting, etc aren't possible. get done as much as you can in volume 3 before starting 4 if you want to be ahead of the game. Most of the cutscenes in 4 are animated, beautifully so in fact that I watched over them once or twice to look at the amount of details in them.

TLDR: visuals are eh, animation is beautiful, story is well done, combat is lacking in difficulty, dungeons lack variety and tend to drag on for awhile, but overall its a fun experience.

"As I expected, most of the negative reviews are from people who are angry that you can't quick save before every fight, or those who are incapable of reading. I recommend this game! I haven't played it a ton, but already I love it. The mechanics are great and likely only going to get better, and it runs fairly well. Are there things that still need to get worked out? Sure, but I fully expect them to.

",True
"not sure yet. i will edit this review in time. i havent played it to full extend. but there are some poor design choices that make it hard to enjoy at times. 

maps are huge. there is barely any guidance. on objective maps you get vague infos where to go through your cellphone serving as a mission log, sometimes with an indicator telling you the distance to your goal, sometimes not, most of the time it's not reachable by direct means anyway. people quickly get lost, both humans and player zombies. some level have built-in ""You are here"" location guides, and there is a map showing up before a level loads, but its still hard. 

on the other hand it may encourage more teamplay than usual. people are put into the need to communicate to find their way through. at least when people with varying skill level are thrown together. but perhaps this is teamplay for the wrong reason, by forced means and simply lack of explanation. if people know their way they sometimes seem to rush ahead and leave some people behind. there are no real barriers (sometimes people need to find keys or tools to get on, but usually it's the skilled player who will find it and not the newbie) or any real incentives to drag people along, not that i would have noticed thus far. ammo hoarding does not seem to slow you down, and unlike no more room in hell or zombie panic source you cannot see and select individual ammo you are carrying but simply drop all the ammo for guns you don't have. and why would you want to share if people waste their ammo and tend to attract more zombies than what's good? i have seen this issue in no more room in hell too. as soon as people know their way they do that way, you can hope for them to ""teach"" the newbies but not everyone is going to show that patience. people can advance ahead and trigger temporary escape vehicles on objective maps dooming every slowpoke. 

if you die or get infected and turn you become a player zombie. in all modes. even in objective maps there are player-controlled zombies. this is probably the most unique thing about contagion. there are always player controlled zombies. but this is also a poorly developed aspect of this game. there is little incentive or motivation for some people to engage their prior teammates. they may just go afk or do that ""friendly zombie"" thing and basically just screw around. if they even manage to find the survivors. as mentioned the maps are huge. zombies can spawn far away from humans. they can climb fences (which feels a bit buggy at times though, and the animations to do so could need polish as well) they have zombie vision to see footsteps. but they seem somewhat inconsistent. if you see them they could be ""outdated"" and the survivors who made them have advanced far beyond. zombies cannot know which objectives the humans are currently following/which location they go for. their only way to locate humans besides following vague footsteps is listening to gunshots, by roaming and guessing around and by hoping to see some npc or other player zombies lunge around at bigger speed presumably hunting someone down. even if you play pvp matches where there are no strict objectives to follow other than kill all you see rounds can still take forever because people simply won't find each other.

contagion feels a bit like a bastard child of zombie panic source and no more room in hell. it has some nice ideas like the cellphones as objective logs and using them to ""call"" living and dead players and locating them by their ringtones, and player zombies have interesting abilites like making npc zombies gather around and follow them, but controlling these can be just a pain the same because they won't run as fast as player zombies do, you need to drag them along, their pathfinding is subpar, which can be tedious on the huge maps. some modes like hunted can be fun, but even there frustration can sneak in when you spawn in bad places or when humans team up even though they are supposed to slaughter each other at first sight. 

a few interersting thoughts went into the game, but i think they just aren't executed as well. if someone asked me ""why would i want to pay for contagion if i can play no more room in hell or zombie panic source for free?"" i couldn't give any too great answer. thats like my biggest issue with contagion. i got exhausted on both nrmih and zps, and those games aren't perfect either, but at least they have more convenient and polished mechanics like proper inside into the things you are carrying or a more satisfying melee system (melee in contagion feels imprecise and like half a pain) and they won't torture you with huge maps and no clue where you should be going to. nothing of what i've seen of contagion seems uniquely enough to justify it being a stand-alone title. if you want co-op you could very well jump at no more room in hell. if you want pvp you could very well jump at zombie panic source. if you want something of both without necessarily of the same good quality and level of polish you may be fine with contagion.",False

"Breaks my heart to say this, but Rise of the Triad is not a good game. If Steam had a neutral vote, I would use that. As it is now, I have to say it's just slightly below the threshold of my recommendation (for whatever it's worth).

The game has mediocre controls and physics, which is terrible for certain levels. Some levels try to be platforming stages, but the awkward physics and movement of your character make precise movements a distant dream, resulting in savescumming and/or frustration. The guns feel extremely weak and lacking in impact, even common enemies can shrug off several ""special weapons"" much too easily. Getting shot at is also poorly conveyed as the direction the damage arrow points at might not be anywhere near the direction the shot came from, not to mention its very poor job at indicating imminent danger.

Easily the most disappointing thing in the game is the level design. It's all over the place with very hit-and-miss results, having more misses than hits, really. They focused too hard on the ""platforming"" of the original and favored it instead of shooting things. The bosses were interestingly designed, but poorly executed, especially the final boss. El Oscuro was a terrible fight in the original to begin with and they somehow managed to capture that same fart in a jar while multiplying the awfulness exponentially.

Graphically, the game is pretty meh for a 2013 game and that's literally all I can say about it.

As for sounds and music, the redone soundtrack turns the unique and diverse originals into generic music with pretty much nothing but the same guitar all the way through. The voice acting is plain bad. Hearing the characters talk mid-game gets grating after a while as they repeat the same line for the tenth bazooka you've picked up in the level. Fortunately, there is an option to enable the original soundtrack, though it only allows the generic midi synths and a few tracks don't even loop properly.

Stability is also an issue. Starting as early as the first level I experienced crashes, but they calmed down after a couple of levels. Crashes still happened, but they weren't as common as in the first few levels. There were also some noticeable strange framerate drops in very specific areas, messing up jumps and letting enemies get free shots on you for a split second.

I still enjoyed at least some of my time playing the game, but I'm glad I am done with it

On a side note, the game likes to mock you if you die, which is cute at first, but gets really annoying really fast when the unique voice clips run out. There's no way to keep that from going stale instantly, so it should have never been added.",False

"I'm just going to stress that Clear Sky isn't as good as Shadow of Chernobyl or Call of Pripyat. It has numerous problems. Not the least of which is just a lack of focus. It recycles half of Shadow of Chernobyl's maps and has a less interesting story to boot.

However, bearing all that in mind it is priced 10$ cheaper and features a rather unique ""faction war"" mechanic. This mechanic essentially has it so that all the different factions in the Zone do battle with each other in real time. The player can join a faction if they so desire, and doing so gives them ready access to better equipment and more friendly areas in the Zone. All in the hopes of taking over the Zone through pure conquest.

The faction war mechanic is extremely well done in this game, and is the reason why anyone plays Clear Sky to this day. Whether it is worth getting is really up to you, since it is the awkward middle child in the series.",True

"This game is truly fantastic. Its apparent from the hack ridden servers that Valve has somewhat abandoned this IP, But even with the bots and the spammers, This game lasts the tale of time. The designs of everything fit so well together complemented by the personalities of each class. For gods sake, The classes all have backstories!

You cant just label this game ""another shooter"", It stands out with its chaotic and fun weapons ( Rocket Launchers, The Dead Ringer, Jarate )
Its hard to learn how to do some really powerful and rewarding mechanics like Sentry Jumping or the basics of a Trolldier.

The F2P experience nowadays is very limited, Without voice communication or text callouts, But its still an experience id recommend to newbies, And once your ready to make a purchase you'll be able to enjoy the full experience of Team Fortress 2.
The overwhelming amount of items and acheivements you can earn in the game is quite frankly insane, With over 500 acheivements and almost limitless items ( Counting the qualities you can add to items like Strange,Killstreak,Painted ) Its an experience i had a blast with.
Mann VS Machine is a well constructed concept that can earn you items and materials for defeating waves of giant soldiers or super league scouts that will fire without hesitance at you,your sentry,or your teammates.
Casual is a bot ridden mess, But recently ive noticed a cooldown of bots, And more human players fighting like intended ( Sort of )
There are an abundance of maps you can get sent to, Ranging from Hightower to Brazil to 2Fort, Alongside the multitudes of gamemodes like Capture The Flag or Control Points.

There are definitely cons to this game ( OP or overnerfed weapons, Bad map design im looking at you Wutville, Small glitches ) but overall ive had no major issues with this game!

My computer isnt the best, It was never intended to run games,but its able to run this pretty smoothly ( outside of huge community servers )
The holiday events are fun and imaginative
And the voice acting is honest to god great, Ill definitely miss Rick May's talent, May he rocket jump in heaven.
This game has so much heart with community support like animations ( Youtubers such as The official Team Fortress, The Winglet, Antoine Delak, Wolt, Kostamoinen and Piemations ) And youtube channels ( People like Mrswipez1, Uncle Dane, Mr Paladin, Fatmagic  ). The community can get pretty toxic over some aspects of thr games development ( mainly the failure of VAC anti-cheat, And how Valve doesnt do much about the game other than small patches )

"I only have 20 hours on record for this game as of the time of writing this review, but I've played all the other King's Bounty games extensively (especially the first 2, The Legend and Crossworlds). (Crossworlds is like an extended version of ""Armoured Princess""; basically the same game with more added to it.) For the record (speaking of DLC) I do have the Fire and Ice DLC for Warriors of the North, but I'm not using it.

If I'd never played the first other King's Bounty games, I would've rated this probably a 9/10, but comparing it to them it's more like an 7.5/10.

Difficulty: 9/10 (Easy - Very Hard)

The King's Bounty games are typically games where the difficulty level actually reflects the difficulty of the game. Playing on easy will be easy, and ""Impossible"" will be very hard. This appears to be no different. There does seem to be weak monsters where they shouldn't be or vice versa, but it's all about ""peeling the onion"". Another important thing to consider is which class you're playing (Warrior, Paladin, Mage). The class itself can affect your difficulty, but it's also important you know how to play them properly. That said, the span of difficulty levels is such that there's something for everybody. 

Graphics: 7/10 (Okay - Good)

The graphics are nothing that are going to make you say ""wow, this is the most beautiful game ever made!"" but they're not terrible, either. There are a LOT of games I get turned off by just by seeing the graphics, and this isn't one of them. They work for what the game is. You can see things easily in the overworld, and the camera is very easy to manage and see around. During battle, the camera is *mostly* ok, and the graphics and animation are appealing.

Price: 9/10 (Worth full price for some, some may want sale or bundle)

For a game as good as this, the price is amazing, and it seems to be on sale often. If buying King's Bounty games for the first time, this is NOT my recommended game, however, I DO recommend buying a bundle that includes all the games, and getting to this one eventually (exactly what I did, hehe).

Gameplay: 9.5/10

The gameplay is fun as heck. You run around the map where mobs are, doing quests, picking up treasure, etc. Mobs chase you, but you can usually avoid them (if you want to). You try to search out the weakest monsters to fight first, like ""peeling an onion"", to level up and work your way to the harder ones. You have like 10 item slots or so with which to equip yourself with various gear and there is a wide variety of units and spells to buy in many places on each island. The game is very customizable to play the way you want to.

Then when you get into battle...oh, so fun. You start on the opposite end of your enemy on a somewhat-small hexagonal board, and take turns moving units, attacking, using abilities, spells, etc. You have 5 different units which are stronger the higher your ""leadership"" stat is. As a warrior, your units will be stronger but as a mage, you'll have more mana to cast strong spells. A paladin is somewhere in between. (Yet more customization.)

When you level up, you get runes that you can use to unlock abilities to help you in battle. Eventually, you'll also be able to upgrade your ""Rage"" abilities (similar to spells, but they use ""Rage"" instead of ""Mana"") and learn new ones.

All in all, very fun, a real gem. The battles are fun for a long time until you get to near the late game, when you have 5 specific units from 5 hard-to-get-to locations (or perhaps there's no more left) and it becomes a chore to keep them all alive or keep bringing them back to life, etc. (Well, that's my experience with The Legend and Crossworlds, anyway.)

Game length & Replayability: 10/10 (semi-long game, highly replayable)

I haven't finished the game, so take this with a grain of salt, but the first and second games of the series are 2 of my top 5 most played Steam games ever, and this game should prove no differently. I'm also judging by the times that other reviewers have played -- Astronomically high. For starters, there are 3 classes that play completely differently, and 4 difficulty levels. There's also fairly varied random seeds. Which units, spells, and items you get each game, when you get them, and in what quantity varies from game to game.

Story: 4.5/10 (Mediocre)

Here's the story: You are a Viking prince of a small island. Your brother is next in line for the throne, and you're bitter about it, wanting to prove yourself to change that. Undead are invading your lands, and this is your opportunity! With your father's blessing, you set off to kill the undead and try to get to the heart of why they're there. Very minor spoilers: [spoiler]Things go a bit south and you have to venture off to other islands in search of help.[/spoiler]

The story is fairly boring and the characters aren't very memorable or ones you'll want to connect with.

Bugs: 4/10 (Bugs here and there, Poor grammar in places*, and an unforgivable amount of crashes.)

Some people exaggerate, but the game DOES crash more often than it should (maybe once every 3-4 hours). That said: Save often. You should be doing that anyway.

*The story is well-written in English...but the description of spells and abilities are not. They look like they came from Google Translate. They are so bad that I honestly don't even know what some abilities do. It's cringe-worthy and an embarrassing stain on an otherwise-decent game.

Verdict: Buy the game at a possibly a discounted price but definitely in a bundle with The Legend and Crossworlds, and play this one afterwards as a little bit of extra flavor. After playing the others for dozens of hours, it's nice to switch to different scenery, new places, a few new units, even new story, etc. But there's absolutely, 100%, no reason to pick Warriors of the North over The Legend or Crossworlds. They are simply far superior in every way.",True

"There are so many games chasing after the success of Stardew Valley, by copying its premise, but what these developers don't seem to understand is that this game is successful because it clearly meant a lot to the developer who created it -- the story, the design and just about every detail.  Developers who want to copy this success have to find a story and/or subject that means that much to them.  

I am actually embarrassed to see how many hours I spent on this game but I've been playing it to 'unplug' - ironically - for years now.  Nevertheless, I think the hours spent speak louder than any other recommendation I could make about the game.

- You can play a normal or harder mode, but the battle can be different. It's not just harder enemies. 
- More 3D environements
- UI and items uses changed a bit too.

The only downside I have is before you can do sidequest, you have to finish the game.

Cons:
Unfinished feel
Slow gameplay
Lack of tutorial and block introduction",False
"What an adventure!!!

This game In a broad term of sense, is good.

It's not amazing, but it's not bad either.

Most of the arguments are of microtransactions in the store, which i agree is a taboo amongst the gaming genre, especially when it leads to game changing elements.

THAT BEING SAID...

I have played just under 40 hours of this game, and I will continue to the end until completion. This game is most definitely easily playable without microtransactions, I still haven't met that ""paywall"" that people seem to get stuck on... As any darksoul player/Cuphead pleb would say, ""get good""

I love this game for a few reasons.

Ally orc A is sent to murder enemy orc (guarding a warchief).
Ally orc ""kills"" enemy orc.
Ally orc is then used to help me betray the warchief.
Turns out Ally orc failed in his mission to kill enemy orc, and it soon becomes a 3v1 because Ally orc A is a dick.

I live, I die, I live again.

Moral of the story, this system with a semi adaptive AI (especially in the early stages on the nemesis difficulty) Is quite the experience to behold. I enjoyed the story so far, and am always getting better at those ""harder"" engagements. Try unequiping your gear to the low level white items you can't trash, and be ready for a bad time. I just feel this game needed some positive reinforcement after all the negativity I've seen scrolling down the playerbase abyss. Honestly ask yourself, what is bad about microtransactions in this game?

(One): It doesn't affect multiplayer as bad as you might think. Sure it helps defend forts against other players, but I've had no problems exploiting weaknesses, I.E (Mostly stealth jumping kills and executions with the occasional Graug stomps).

(Two): Defending players don't lose champions, Your champion dies forever if you are INVADING in ranked play.

Buying transactions only boosts the speed in which you can speed through the game obtaining some end game gear/champions, why would you care about that, if it'll just ruin the adventure for you?

Final thoughts:
Everyone has their own opion, but this is mine.

Play the way how you want to play, buy microtransactions if you just wanna feel a little stronger, or grind like any other RPG, MMO, Adventure game. Grind to become stronger to face that one steep hill you just can't seem to climb.

If you really hate microtransactions... Why did you buy it day one without reading on it? There was a lot of articles online about this game, If you just took a second to look...

Tell me what you guys think in the comments, how the game could improve GAMEPLAY wise. Bugs that could be gamebreaking and needs to be fixed. Instead of focusing 100% on ONE thing especially a tad bit minute. Lets focus on some things the developers can look towards on improving for us, the gamers. 

(P.S) I bought a few boxes ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). 

ALSO I do not want to go on another spiel about the game, but there IS one thing else I do not agree with. Season pass that splits what should have been content already included if it comes out at the same time? GFYS.",True

This game is fantastic if you really enjoy an ambitious game. This game allows you to optimise your team in several different ways. The combat is somewhat confusing for a newbie; however it is different and fresh. It has a board game like feel to it, but you learn that you quickly can create your own odds if you are clever. There is not too many options for levels to play: I guess they all are pretty large and all.

"well what can i say. its a good game, untill you run out of missions and hit max level. a lot of fun to have with friends/solo. butttt when you hit max level and done all the missions its time to head into the dark zone. which isn't very fun. if you go solo, you get idiots kill you when you try to evac the equipment you found, which adds to the fun? not in my opinion. they are higher level so can kill you in  about 5 bullets. i was with 3 other people just about to drop of our stuff and we get killed by 1 guy in 10 seconds. not even a joke lol. as everyone has said its a grinding game. getting the best equipment etc and can replay missions but you wont get anything good. its only the dark zone which creates the best equipment. i think if they brought in leveled zones it would be better create a better gaming experiance and balances it out. for the guns, (i only have the game no expansions) their isn't really much veriaty. for assualt rifles i have pretty much found the ak or m60? is the weapons of choice. but hey, its what you make of it. and i would recommend it even if you only play the missions.
also a lot of people saying the missions are the same etc... you tell me one game where the missions etc arnt the same and then you have the right to complain. that also counts for the ai. honestly i dont care... if its a decent game you dont. have fun with friends etc and you wont care either. just take it for what it is.",True

"Hello all,

UPDATED
After a substantial amount of time playing, I have updated my review. The Devs have made a spectacular amount of progress. Thank you all and see you in the Exiled Lands!

OLD
Thank you for taking the time to read this review. I am just going to put my two pence in on some categories that I've noticed. Please note that I have recently been playing the Testlive version and have been exposed to many of the new features that will be coming out on release in May. I also intend to update my review after I have had some time to play the fully released version. I am currently rating this game as Positive however, the rating is contingent upon the state of the final release. If anyone has any questions, please feel free to let me know below.

-Survival Mechanics
UPDATED
Much of the survival mechanics in the old review are still valid. The DEVs have reduced the significance of the sandstorm a bit but that is about all.

OLD
At face value, the survival aspects are almost as barbaric as the theme of the game. You have a temperature system, food, water and local wild life to address in order to stay alive. You can die from Heatstroke, Frostbite, Hyenas, Crocodiles, Elephants, etc.. The map has different temperature and mob zones so there exists a various range of ""flavors"" or environments for the player to explore.

-Combat System
UPDATED
The combat has received some adjustments. Some weapons have been added, stats modified, animation changes. Older players returning may find a need to adjust.

OLD
The combat system has been completely revamped from its previous iterations. Combat now includes target locking, chain attacks and proper dodging/blocking. There exists a plethora of weapons from which to choose including; swords, spears, axes, bows and bombs. Current players, please note that the Devs have removed crossbows for release and may reintroduce them post-release if they can resolve some bugs associated with them. Engaging Thralls is now a much more dangerous task, as you must now treat Stamina with a high degree of concern. If Stamina reaches 0, you can no longer perform any meaningful action such as attack, sprint, block or dodge.

-Economy/Crafting
UPDATED
Lots of crafting changes have been made. DLCs have brought additional items such as building pieces and placeables. Gold and Silver have very little value beyond token purchases in the NPC village of Sepermeru.

OLD
Crafting in CE allows for the player to select from a variety of weapons and armor. You can select various pieces of armor even if the pieces are from different sets. Each armor piece has their own unique material requirements. You can also dye them with clan colors to show your creativity. The crafting in CE follows a tiered system where you need to obtain the crafting recipes for each crafting station, each unlocking their own levels of tools, weapons and armors. The ""economy"" is a new development in CE. There now exist in-game currency such as Gold and Silver. Please note that you cannot buy this currency from the Devs and it is an actual object within the world. This is beneficial in a sense that you do not have to be too concerned about ""Pay to Win"". You can mine Gold, smelt it into Gold Bars, mint coins in the furnace and use it to trade with other players or buy items in the NPC City.

-Optimization/Bugs/Exploits
UPDATED
Lots of bugs have been squashed and exploits addressed. Though, some still exist.

OLD
The Devs have actually made some serious efforts to optimize the game's performance. Official Servers rarely crash, the FPS is stable and a lot of the animations have been corrected. The Bugs are also being addressed though, some still persist. The Devs have also addressed several exploits within the game such as ""jousting"", repeated power attacks and others. Please note that a lot of the exploits were due to the bugs. Hackers are still a problem to be honest however, I hope that the Devs address this as well.

-Building/Thralls
UPDATED
New building pieces have been introduced from the DLCs however, the building mechanics remain the same. Thralls have had some improvements as they now level. Not that they cannot go from T1 to T2,3 but they can increase their stats.

OLD
You can build massive structures in CE. There exist three tiers from which you can mold your fortress. You can also raid other player's bases with trebuchets and bombs depending on your choice of server. There are many different placeables that you can use such as tables, chairs, banners and many others, though many are cosmetic. Thralls are essentially NPCs that you can enslave to do your bidding. They can be used to carry objects, fight at your side and lend bonuses to crafting. Older players, you can now dress and arm them to your heart's content.

-Story
UPDATED
No change in story.

OLD
There is a story or plot for CE and it seems to be very interesting. I won't get into it too much as I do not want to spoil it. You can discover the story by visiting many different runes on the map. 

-Promised Features
UPDATED
Mounts! They finally came out with mounts. No sorcery though. A map expansion has been confirmed as a future release.

OLD
I do have a major problem with what has happened with some of the promised features. Originally it was pitched that CE would include Sorcery, Mounts and some form of City Life for the Thralls. All of this has been pulled for release and some may never make it into the game at all. The Devs have removed the possibility of City Life altogether and will only introduce the others if they can resolve some lingering issues associated with them. The Devs need to find an FX artist for the Sorcery animations and have been unable to locate someone for the position. The Devs have indicated that they want to bring Sorcery into Conan however, as of right now, it's not a guarantee. Mounts are experiencing major issues and may not be included at all. The Devs may have bitten off more than they can chew it seems.

Future Development
UPDATED
The release was fine. Funcom has essentially been bought out by Tencent and they are considering expanding off of the Conan franchise.

OLD
-I am wary of what CE will be like post-launch. The Devs have indicated that the map is ""complete"", despite their being several sections of the map that could hold entire biomes. We will get a swamp/jungle and a volcano biome on release so that is a plus. If you guage the tone of the Devs during their video blogs, it seems that there may be some patching post-launch and maybe the Sorcery bit however, that might be the end of CE's development.

-Summary
UPDATED
Buy it on sale and suffer through the grind. Also... be sure to put the endowment slider all the way to the right ;)

OLD
Overall, it's a good game in my opinion. There are some items that the Devs can and should address. I don't think that the game will be worth a full $60.00 on release. If they keep the game around $30 or $40, that may be worth it. The mechanics for the game are fairly simplistic yet surprisingly fulfilling. I really hope that the final release will be rewarding.",True

"This game is a wonderful example of story driven exploration, prodding you onwards with different communications and downloaded information without demanding you do things in one specific way. That being said I would not recommend it to those that don't like wandering around to search for different items and lore, given the fair criticism that many items can only be found by randomly exploring.
More than that, it is an incredibly atmospheric game best played at night with headphones on and the lights out. The themes of alienation and exploration shine most when you allow yourself to be deeply immersed.",True

"Love this game.  Its beautiful, relaxing, and simple yet challenging.  There are achievments that you can try to get (Im one of the achievment whores) and they are not easy.  However, my favorite aspect to this game is the amazing music!  Basically, everytime you make a move or the passangers are picked up, and new noise is introduced to the music.  So the music develops as your metro develops.  It is such a small thing but it makes me love the game even more.",True
"Basic Idea:

Tomb Raider tells the story of Lara Croft. You have to fight enemies and solve puzzles to progress. There's a very specific storyline that you're following, and as you progress you learn more and more about the island you're on and its inhabitants.

Pros:

- Nice storyline, you really get to understand the situation as you progress
- About 10 hours of gameplay (can also be considered a con)
- Nice graphics
- Good combat system
- Nice puzzles
- Very awesome cinematic scenes

Cons:

- There's quite a bit of handholding. The game really gives you a clear path to follow, and a lot of the map is remarkably conveniently built
- The sidequests are boring and don't add a lot to the game
- The end is a bit predictable, apart from some minor elements",True

I can start the game and then it's 1 am. The building process gives great satisfaction and there's always room for improvement. Spent 300 hours on the game and I'm still a noob, just beat the 15-hour completion target and haven't even tried the more aggressive biters or building a mega base.

"as it stands i cannot recommend this game. I have been following the development and kicked myself that i missed it on kickstarter. No pun intended. I was looking forward to playing Moon Hunters and booted it up to beautiful music and nice graphics. I started a game and having no clue what to do or where to go I died quickly. Not a problem. Woke up in a camp and went to a town. After chatting with some people I went back to explore and fight. Combat was passable but I didn't buy Moon Hunters for the combat. I wanted the story and clan development. It boasted taking from King of Dragon Pass. I never got far enough to see if that's true or not because the bare bones menu system made me think I was missing key. I checked out key binding and soon found the bindings changed and unable to change back or reset to default. I even deleted the game and reinstalled. It is so messed up I can't even play the game. As it stands, I cannot recommend Moon Hunters. I hope I can change this whole review and soon to a thumbs up.

"The Combat in Blackguards obviously carries this game through all its shortcomings. Each battle-map is different fom the last and has a unique feel to it. Customizing your characters in weapon skills and magic feels rewarding. The most fun comes from figuring how this game actually works, like when the points you just spent make a noticeable difference in the overall challenging battles. Don't expect too much offensive magic, you're better off keeping your mages in a support-role (where they ROCK hard). You probably heard about the interaction with stuff in battles, but that's totally overrated: Wasting a turn to push a box or set something ablaze is rarely worth it. Occasionally this is implemented quite nicely, like trapping something in a cage, but most of the time there's only boxes to push.

I hear people drooling over how interesting the characters are, but honestly your party members are *completely* one-sided and sometimes downright dislikeable  (*minor spoiler* Zurburan selling Takate to some slaver...seriously? *spoiler end*). Their is no intruiging background story to them and definetly no progression in personality whatsoever. The story on the other hand is compelling, but since story-specific dialogue is only few and far in between the dominating combat, it's ultimately thin...very thin (if you know DBZ, you lnow what I'm talking about *lol*). The world itself feels a bit on the bland side and the streamlined gameplay leaves little room for Lore or in-depth consideration of your potentially stunning surroundings.

The biggest issue here is how barebone the gameplay is. After a fight you basically point&-)click your mouse button a few times to advance the dialogue or move to the interchangeable towns to check on the completely interchangeable merchants and start the next fight. Combat-Dialogue-Click-Combat-Repeat. Kudos for the quest-writing though which I found top notch!


So: Combat: AWESOME. The rest: *MEH*. I enjoyed it a lot, also because it is more fast-paced than some of its TBS-brethren.",True

"Honestly. I don't understand why people feel a need to leave bad reviews for games in early access that SAY they're in early access and only say ""Dont buy until release"" Now that thats over with on to the actual review.
I loved subnautica to bits. i have a hard time with anything even remotely scary ie: reaper leviathans >.< and i still loved that game. This game seems to be following in its footsteps to being an absolutely wonderful game. Its SO DIFFERENT yet you can feel that it is at its very core STILL Subnautica and that is something a lot of games really cant pull off. We're still seeing many many things get tweaked and fixed which is OBVIOUS for an early access game. but when i look at the quality of what they decided was finally finished for Subnautica i have absolutely BELOW ZERO (Ha) issue giving them money so they can more easily realise the dream that is this game. Its beautiful, the creatures are fabulous. the biomes are engaging, the new vehicles make me so excited for what they could come up with next. theres new building pieces, new characters, and best of all a NEW STORY! So please. if you dont like playing unfinished games but loved Subnautica, i would still suggest buying this and waiting to play it until full release. because it really is a game with alot of potential that is ALREADY FUN!!!

TLDR: Its a fabulous game already even with it clearly being unfinished. Still buy it if you know you're going to play it eventually though because supporting devs like this is what the gaming community needs.",True

"If you are X-COM series fan and/or if you liked the previous game, you will like this one. Same foundation as XCOM1 but adds and improves a lot. Just the time I spent customizing my soldiers and weapons could easily be like one third of my total time played, lol.

"I'm kinda mixed when it comes to this game.  On one hand it follows the pathfinder rule set really well and all the maps are pretty accurate to the ones form the TTRPG module (that i can remember, it's been ages since I played the module), and the diolog and social encounters feel great and like they have actual consequences.  
On the other hand, it's not turn based combat, I think it's trying to be like the old Baulders Gate games?  I'm not 100% sure it's been ages since I've tried those.  The combat in this is you and your party auto attack but you can pause combat to give yourself time to think.  Paused or not, you can order your character/party to use skills or spells or items during combat and pick a target. 
I made a handful of characters and playing a mage class feels clunky to me, partly because unless you're constantly pausing to pick your spells to fire off you just stand there shooting a cross bow, and I didn't really feel like I needed to use my magic, since just standing there shooting was doing better than taking the time to pick and cast spells.  If this had a combat system similar to Divinity Origonal Sin 2 than my literal only issue would be fixed.
All in all, this game IS fun, but the combat feels clunky and, to me at least, like the skills and spells are not needed to succeed in combat.",True

"Is there much to say about Grim Dan? Grim Dude is a great dude to play whether you're at your couch, on the phone, or even right at home.

The story takes the arisen through a thrilling, side-splitting adventure across the land of Dawn. The main enemies that plaque the lands are the green guys (spells and glowing effects) and the red guys (necromantic summoners). Overall, you'll probably like the red guys better because they dont have as many annoying effects.

The audio in Grin Dune is anything short of amazing. Tranquil music is played in the safest areas, and the music really picks up your pace in the fast pace areas with many frightening enemies. Really a great OST that I even have on my playlist.

Alright RPG nerds; here's what you're all waiting for. The customization in the game is simply innumerable. There are millions of combinations that can quickly decimate foes , or spiral your character to the deepest chasms of Dawn. The choice is yours.

"I have never posted here about the good/bad of a game. But this game is so profoundly terrible, that I had to say a bit. 

Right from the start, where you can't config the controls, it is awful. Really? 2016 and I can't reconfig the controls? I have to use my mouse software to reconfigure your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized abortion of a control scheme? Great start.

You spend most of the game stabbing or blocking, but mainly reacting to a question...yellow or blue? You're not really playing, your just reacting, yellow or blue.

The final scene is also terrible. Instead of doing what you have been doing, stab/block/yellow or blue, it's now just yellow or blue. Trying to block or stab when the game doesn't want you to will cause you to fail. Don't be silly. Just wait for that yellow or blue.

Boss fights were terrible as well. It was: ""oh, you beat him? Ok. Do it again.""

And then, instead of just killing Nero, he does what he does (no spoiler). That is idiotic. Add the shared grin by 'those two' at the end. It was like the Joker from Batman, and his pop up jack in the box. Haaaaaa. Did a 12 yr old write the story? I understand the whole roman empire expand collapse history here, but this telling was childish (those evil wiker men...was waiting for Heather Donahue to pop out).

"I recommend this game, but with a huge caveat. How much do you [i]really[/i] enjoy retro platforming? 

Everything about this game is very well done: graphics, the Heavy Metal magazine heroine, and the fantastic soundtrack. There's even a good bit of replay value, which isn't always the case for platformers. The gameplay is... well, ""retro"".

If you've never experienced actual older games, or you tend to forget how many of them actually sucked, I recommend watching a playthrough of a game called Phantis, which this game is basically a remake or spiritual sequel of. With some exceptions, older platforming games often had slow, sluggish protagonists, with fast, incessantly spawning enemies, with awkward jumping and shooting controls. This game is no exception.

Serena walks slowly. She has to stand still to shoot. There's a small delay both before and after firing the actual projectile. She can only shoot up at a shallow angle (perhaps 30 degrees), but not straight up. You get hurt from touching a robot's toe or a wizard's robe. Additionally, the delay in firing means that if you try shooting just before you land, you won't fire. Even her ship takes a moment to accelerate to full speed when moving up or down. None of these would be a huge problem by themselves, but combined, it can lead to some very frustrating moments. 

Everything else about Ultionus is improved over the older games; why not tighten up the gameplay too? There are also plenty of other ""retro"" games that actually have really great controls.

As I'm sure most can agree, it's more fun to challenge the game, not its controls. But if you love punishing gameplay, repetition until perfection, or just love all platforming games, then it's hard to do wrong by Ultionus. Even better, it's very inexpensive.",True
"Maybe I'm misremembering, but I remember this game being more bleak and depressing than it is now. I don't remember 'escape' being an option back in the day. In any case, the scenarios are great. I understand they are meant to make you sympathize with the plight of people stuck in a warzone. I found the museum scenario to be the best at that because there are quite a few moral conundrums which appear which don't have immediate answers. Unless you don't care about the historical artifacts of the made-up country in which case I imagine at least one was much easier to make. But in all seriousness, it's a fairly bleak and serious game which I enjoy immensely for the atmosphere it creates and the hard problem solving of the actual gameplay and exploration.",True

He was a man who took his life day by day, slaying monster, feeding himself and earning gold to make end meets. As i finished his journey and close the book on this tale, i cannot help but feel a bittersweet emotion as if i was saying goodbye to a long time friend.

"[quote]Towards the middle of Episode 5, just prior to the climax of the story you've been playing for about 12 hours, you are literally asked to carry groceries[/quote]

As someone who loved LIS1 and LIS:BTS, I can't recommend LIS2. 

[b]Choices:[/b]
The innocent charm of Chloe and Max and all their school friends leading to ultimate demise from the first game is nowhere to be found. The uncertainty of the choices available in the first game is completely gone -- In this game, every choice is good vs evil and there's no ambiguity or guessing at immediate results. For the few choices that actually make a difference later in the game, you're given immediate feedback in the form of a loading icon pointing at which character your choice benefited.

[b]Story:[/b]
The story itself is incredibly boring and straightforward relative to the first game. Nothing surprises you. It starts off slow and stays that way for the entire game. The later episodes essentially turn into one long expose into the people around Sean and Daniel. Rather than ""feeling"" how Sean and Daniel are perceiving the world through gameplay, you are merely watching the story unfold.

Episode 5 is a complete joke. You spend 3 hours completing chores, talking to a bunch of people, and then watch the end of your story, and it takes almost 4 hours to do it! 

[b]Gameplay/Mechanics:[/b]
I was ready to quit the game and stop playing if I had to perform one more mindless chore, such as picking up a bunch of items that are hidden merely for the purpose of motivating you to explore the area rather than giving you good reasons to do so on your own. Towards the end of the game I skipped exploring because there was no reward for doing so -- no funny or unexpected finds, no easter eggs, just a waste of 10 seconds listening to Sean reminisce about items he left when he ran from the cops. Towards the middle of Episode 5, just prior to the climax of the story you've been playing for about 12 hours, you are literally asked to carry groceries from a car into a house, and you get nothing out of it. 

Daniel's power is nothing compared to Max's. There are limited opportunities to use it, and you basically have no choice in whether or not it's going to be used.

[b]Technical:[/b]
The animation is a joke. The developers clearly spent very little time refining the dialogue animation. Mouths essentially open and close. Additionally, there's no emotion in Daniel's (or any other minor characters') face 99% of the time he's talking, compared to Sean who got a bit more treatment.",False

To be honest, there were times during the early access where I was sure you abandoned the development of this game. I was day 1 early access customer and it was bit of a journey. In the beginning the game's performance was a desaster, then the controls were a desaster, one patch later the destruction was toned down so that we all experienced no fun at all and then in the end everything turned out to be very good.

The game feels great now. The destruction is great. The Game runs very well now on my rig. I struggled with 30 fps on a great machine during early access and now I have constant >100 fps on maxed out settings. The AI is fun, the multiplayer is even more fun. We have dedicated servers.

"This game's controls are just horrible. I can't imagine a more convoluted controls-system. DO NOT BUY. It is an aweful arcade game, masquerading as an adventure game,

* Unskippable arcade. Even at ""easy"" you must switch RAPIDLY between *THREE* sets of controls: AWSD, arrows, and mouse. All three for the same sequence or YOU DIE, and have to RESTART the entire sequence. Fun.
* Controls 01 - unplayable. The camera keeps bouncing, controls bounce with it. You'll have to fight the controls just to go straight
* Controls 02 - any interaction requires odd mouse gestures, instead of simple menu selection. It is easy to make a mistake, and I have a random-adventure-game, which must be a new kind of genre.. 
* ALL (!) dialogs are on a very short timer. Even normal conversations. I barely manage to read them through. And because of the stupid mouse-gestures thing, I end up selecting pretty-random answers. So stupid, seriously.

Between the arcade and the lousy controls, you'll find yourself stumbling through this game, rather than actually playing.

"I was genuinely surprised with the progress this game has made and the content it has being early access. Tree of Life is an entertaining sandbox type game that strongly encompasses the crucial need to create a settlement with multiple people. To succeed in this game, you must be able to work with others since a solo town poses way too many risks. I personally don't like the whole ""Figure it out yourself"" mindset that you need to be at since this game gives you with no background information at all - a very rough learning curve. I would prefer to be able to know how to craft things and where to find some of these items at any given moment of time rather than just exploring and hoping that someone else may know. Once it hits night time, it's basically impossible to see anything early on, given the basic torches, campfires, and possibly furnaces. You are not able to really do much except cook stuff and talk to others until you progress wayyyy further into the game when you unlock slightly better lighting crafts, but even those aren't much of a help. Overall, the game is a lot of fun, and if you are willing to get over the steep learning curve and play the game how it is meant to so far, you'll enjoy it.",True

"This game is excellent. It is a light Metroidvania where you switch between three playable characters at save points in order to access other areas of the game. The combat is fast and fun with each character fighting in different ways (either fast with barehands, sturdy with a shield or accurately with two swords) and the enemies are well done and beat some ass if you let them. The writing seems to be a bit childish but makes more sense the further you get into it and the gameplay is enhanced with power-up moves and equips.

My only request would be more replay buttons accessible. For example, on the round win screen, round fail screen, etc. We all know we're going for perfection here. Why delay it by going back to the main screen and having to confirm your replay TWICE to replay a level. In a game where EVERY click matters, it seems like two too many.

C)  It's Capcom...

However, none of those things bother me, and as a result I really like it.  They kept it simple as they should have.

The online has worked great for me (unless I turn off the ""Same Region"" filter).  Just keep in mind that no net code in the world can fix someone's crappy internet connection.

I am not so sure about enough people wanting to play beat 'em ups on Steam to warrant getting this JUST for the online aspect, but it is a blast when there are people online.

Hand out some beers and controllers (in that order), and proceed to walk right and punch/kick/slash/shoot/drop-kick/roundhouse/body-slam/laser-sword the sh*t out of everything!

"[h1] Let it be said that, I review this because I come back to it, but If I could I would leave the review mixed [/h1]

[b] So, why's that Lung, the blank name guy? [/b]

Simply put it, the game is just if someone thought [i] ""what if we combined dark souls, with a hilarious weed strategy game"" [/i] Well, the game isn't all that funny, it's atypical, generic humor. The Art style is unique, but the games difficulty makes no sense. A lot of it is left to a gamble. [b] With this short description made, lets actually review the game. [/b]

[h1] Difficulty, and how to fail [/h1] 

A lot of this game relies on certain actions happening at certain times. They are random, however. and your patience will be tested a lot. The AI will go left, right, center. Loading the same save wont yield the same results either. That's fine and dandy but, down to the AI it changes per level. The player is left with no room to study or learn, they're thrown to a brick wall, and told ""DO IT"" until they do it. This means you may fail a level up to 50 times. No I'm serious. 

[b] Mini-segment, Saving troubles [/b]
The devs were serious about not cheesing the game either, as the save function is unique. You cannot save scum. If the game thinks nothing is calm, or you're under attack? You will not save. It will just say ""Trying to save"" because, f*ck you. This means you may end up redoing a certain part of a level many times, and then just restart all together because the save was awkwardly placed. The game attempts to checkpoint areas you've raided and pushed but won't always do it. You can trust the game about as much as you can trust the stupid AI.

[u] Difficulty segment 2, [/u]

Since there's no difficulty settings you're pushed to learn. The game will try to push this on you with ""room placement"" which is important, however it won't apply anything to the AI. The AI is always better than you. This doesn't mean you can overcome it, but it doesn't strike a good balance. This game really comes off as a good concept, executed poorly. Some segments are meant to fail, some are not. I got so frustrated sometimes due to the AI's stupidity, I ended up just using a trainer from MrAntiFun's website. Of course, the only thing that worked was infinite health. Was it scummy of me? Sure. But I'm not going to sit here and get stressed out over this games stupidity. Long story short, you come into this game to get screwed over, and the challenge is overcoming that, however sometimes to overcome that? You have to rebuild from the ground up. Meaning, hours spent trying to beat one level sometimes. 

[h1] AI Troubles [/h1]

I mentioned above the AI is attuned to certain levels to act differently. Do you know what this means? This means some levels, it acts differently than others. Some levels you may have a stealth mechanic, some levels you may not. It encourages unique mechanics that disappear just as you learned them. That's irritating on its own. However I think the most noteworthy AIDs I have ever faced was the AI taking over ambient buildings on its own, once it did that, it just became a festering hive of trash. 1 Person takes the building correct? The AI spawns in x30 more troops in that building, thin air, no troop movement, no lockers to purchase, the AI just did it. Now that ambient building? I can't take it. The AI has an overwhelming force that forces me to avoid that area entirely now. Oh also, It's troops only it gets have 2 to 3 varieties If I'm not mistaken. The Police have more varieties than the gangs. ""Bull, Butt Boy, Runner"" are all 3 of the AI's units. Butt Boy is the weakest, Bull is the strongest, Runner is the most balanced. I know this because I check their units frequently. What amuses me is, all these units have statistics, that they don't actually use beyond stamina and fighting, and health. The AI could easily sell and bake stuff but I'm assuming budget cuts were made and the AI doesn't actually make money, it just exists and spreads like some kind of rat plague. It doesn't feel fair at times to have to grind, and try, and meanwhile the AI can't actually do anything other than shoot, or punch. It doesn't outsell or steal your business, it just takes buildings and stands there. No one sells anything. Like c'mon now...

[h1] Mechanics, Micro, and Stupidity [/h1]

The 3 words of the apocalypse for this game. Where to start. So, to cover buildings you need Fighters. At first it may seem silly, but each unit does have its own characteristics. Dealers have stamina, the brown hooded dealers have less stamina but can fend for themselves, cooks can produce super fast (and do better than dealers and brown hooded dealers) but have no stamina, fighters can punch, and the green shirt fighters are tanks. Except, they only get 5 more health and that's it. Seems kinda, dumb. When assaulting you may have to get high on your own supply, Give your troops green to heal, and brown (I just call it red) to deal more damage, brown causes bleeding so green cancels that out, this can give you some decent leverage. Need production faster for more money or supply? Use purple. Stuff like this. When assaulting though, sometimes you do not have the time of day against the AI to train, you must go out immediately, this means sending hordes of untrained fighters, now I mentioned the brown green mechanic above yes? Imagine doing that manually because the game doesn't let you control group fighters, wouldn't that be funny? Oh wait... 

There's a lot of times like this where you're expected to micro a bunch of troops with god awful controls and the game doesn't let you select them easily, it plays like a security detail sim, which would be fine, if I was on the defense. Sometimes I need to be offensive, where advanced controls are needed, and the game just doesn't provide them. This is the micro segment, too much to control, too little tools to do it with. Now where does micro bridge into for the 5 seconds it debuted here? Stupidity. Your own men are brain dead. They will take the stupidest routes if it doesn't make sense. For example lets say you have a couch top floor near where you sell, and you have a couch bottom floor where your fighters train, you have 2 selling points, If Seller A notices Seller B is on the Couch, and Seller A is exhausted, instead of waiting in a line for the couch, Seller A will go [i] ALL THE WAY DOWNSTAIRS TO THE TRAINING ROOM, WASTING MORE TIME BECAUSE HE HAS NO STAMINA, TO USE THE COUCH, BY WHICH TIME SELLER B WILL HAVE FINISHED. [/i] It is infuriating to witness this happen because you are losing money, time, and employees are getting salary. This is stupidity, many times AI will do the stupidest interactions possible when you aren't looking, and its up to you to babysit them, attack, and deal with attacks on your territory. This is where the game destroys itself in front of you. 

Salary? Lets talk about that, Employees have inconsistent salary, the only thing that changes is their buy-in fee. They all demand the same salary that ever so rises as you hire more employees, this gives the game a stern bottleneck for the player and how many people they can hire (paired with the lockers you must get that the AI just ignores and doesn't worry about. Cool.)  This means; Dealers are worthless, Just use Cooks, if you have a couch next to the selling point, and a rack next to it? cooks all the way. They have no stamina but they sell a lot faster than your dumb street trash will. It's a shame as I was hoping the salary mechanic would be a lot more interesting but here we are. Employees? they have little variation. Don't hire tanks. Ever. They're a waste of time. They absorb very little more and have half damage. Just get a generic fighter. Thugs? Get the browncoats, they can fend themselves against bad trips. But that's it, it varies on station to station, person to person, and what you do, it's annoying at times. 

I would TLDR here but blame Valve for putting a cap on reviews.",True
"I bought it because it costs 5$, and I remember the fun times when I played Duke Nukem 3D, but really it doesn't even worth 5$.

"This is a typical funcom game: good idea, poor execution.

The game starts out pretty fun with the survival and exploring elements. It's a bit slow and grindy, but that wouldn't be a problem if the things you are grinding for weren't liable to disappear at any given moment due to poor coding. When you settle down and start building your base, that's when things start to fall apart. Whether it's structures falling through the world, npc's disappearing, or purges spawning inside your base instead of attacking from the outside like they are supposed to, this game becomes insanely frustrating. The game is a buggy mess, the combat is clunky, and the hit boxes are outright bizarre. It sometimes feels like playing an alpha or early beta, not a full price, full release game. On the rare occasion you get a response to support requests, the devs are rude and unhelpful. Even though the game is unfinished and often unplayable, funcom is pumping out paid dlc left and right for some reason.

Summary: 4/10 - decent looking game, good ideas, sadly unplayable and devs don't care",False

I'm gonna cringe so much during this cause Im a big baby"" (Im used to anime characters having high pitched voices, so its really wierd to hear English high pitched)

I may be a big baby, but goodness me, this was FAR better than I was prepared to give credit for. The English VA actually helped with a fair few of the characters. I loved the tropes were really cheesy, but it built off them, rather than just leaving it at that. I enjoyed the choices I can make (I loved acting like a pervy doofus without knowing Id be punished story wise), not to mention the battles, though bare, have more involvement than  a lot of VN.

Guess you can say this game sure ""SHOU'd me!""

They fixed the bug that was making my whole operating system lock up so I had to reboot, although the game still hangs on exit and I need to kill the task to close it. But the problem they didn't fix is that way too much of the game depends on luck. No matter how much thought you put into strategy bad RNG will end your game right at the first turn. To make up for that the game hands you a lot of goodies that give the game away early. The AIs aren't playing to win, so player can get an insurmountable lead before turn 100.

"I played the original Subnautica on my Xbox pass so the hours do not show up in my Steam page.. but I reckoned I put in 50+ plus on that game. I've bought the steam bundle with the expansion Below Zero on the sale. Played the expansion to bits

Now,  it's early access so there's room to change. So my early thoughts.

1. Lot's of new additions to the previous iteration like temperature warning's, new creatures bla bla etc.

At the moment the most pressing now I want to say this.. later I will add the rest

THE SEA TRUCK IS A STEP DOWN FROM THE CYCLOPS
Subnautica is about being in command when exploring the deep mysteries of the ocean, I don't care it's in the alien world. I've played till I unlocked the Cyclops and OH GOD when that machine voice says ENGINE POWERING UP every single time I get the goosebumps. I'm IN CHARGE HERE. I'm the CAPTAIN HERE. Sure no multiplayer but I LOVE evey minute of it running here and there rearming the decoys.. checking on power cells levels.. going outside to repair damages.. ITS MY BOAT and the feelllllll it legit AWESWOME.

Now.. Below Zero? A SEA TRUCK ARE YOU KIDDING ME???  OH WOW ITS MODULAR.. OH WOW 
NO 
It's a step back, I don't care about the bugs and the unfinished stuff but I hope this is not the endgame vehicle after slogging all that while to built a frigging seatruck. The prawn suit ? YOU can't access the storage from the train.. you have to go out and access the storage. Where's that feel of submarine security from the original game as in like everything is accessible from within your BOAT.. only need to go out to patch welds where and there after a battle with a leviathan(s).  Oh and the freedom to build ANY thing in your BOAT... like storage.. fabricators... indoor planters ETC inside??  I CUSTOMIZE MY CYCLOPS AS I SEE FIT I CAN'T DO THAT IN A BLOODY SEA TRUCK TRAIN! 

It's early access sure.. Even... evennnnn you're port the Cyclops over from the original without any updating to the base vehicle it's fine..It's FINE I don't thing it's lazy or whatsoever because look.. the Sea Truck idea is OK.. its nice concept but NO... 

Let me paint you a picture.. SUBNAUTICA.. SUB.. SUBMARINE... SUBMARINE ADVENTURE.. SUBMARINE CAPTAIN

NOT BLOODY SUB TRUCKER YEE HAAHH.. JESUS EVEN THE INGAME SOUND OF THE SEA TRUCK IDLING IS LIKE A REAL TRUCK THERE""S NO DIESEL ENGINES IN THE FUTURE GEDDIT??? IT""S ELECTRIC! ELECTRIC !!

"Really a great game. I own both Verdun and Tannenberg and hope to see a 3rd game for the macedonian/italian front (wink wink). They nailed the speed and momentum of the Eastern front in ww1. Constant attacks and retreats, fighting over 1 stronghold over and over again until bot teams are drained out. Its action phased but also realistic. One rifle bullet or a well placed revolver/pistol shot and you are dead. I am happy to see for once Imperial Russia with Bulgaria and Romania got some attention since they contributed a lot to ww1. The game has a few minor bugs that in my 30 summ hours I encountered but nothing game breaking. (A few times I spawned with my character and his gun invisible for a few second. There was and issue of floating grenades but they fixed that). 
I honestly recommend this game to everyone who is interested in ww1. You wont regret it.

"For someone that generally sticks to AAA titles, this game is an absolute treat and has taken me completely by surprise in it's depth of play styles and ways to approach missions.  Best way to describe it would be Deus Ex meets old school GTA.  Each level is big and varied enough that you can usually scrounge around for some basic items to get you started, then as you take out more targets or complete more missions, you start gaining momentum and can really take your class to it's full potential.

This game is pretty fun single player but it REALLY shines in co-op, especially local co-op.  I was amazed at how much further I could get by synergizing with other classes.  For example, the Vampire and Cannibal seem to go well together since the Vampire can kill enemies by sucking their blood, then the Cannibal can eat their corpses.  Both players as zombies makes for a very interesting game as once you get a half dozen kills, your zombified victims start overtaking the entire level making missions much easier to complete.  Being able to revive fallen players (sacrificing half your health to give them half of that) is a game changer and I was able to get so much further when my friend and I were able to regroup and focus on getting our health back up and continue pressing on.

I love that all the classes have pros and cons.  I've found there are some classes I just can't get into, like the Shopkeeper or Slum Dweller, but it may be that I haven't figured out how to leverage their traits properly (didn't like the Zombie until I figured out the proper way to begin creating a zombie mob) or it could also be they just don't appeal to me, but I feel like the classes are varied enough that any gamer will find the class that suits them best.

I'm pretty amazed at how much fun this game is as normally indie titles like this bore me pretty quickly and don't seem to have much depth, but this game certainly does.  Major props to Matt.  Glad I was able to get this on sale but will gladly shell out more money in the future if Matt continues to add new and fun functionality to the game.  The following are purely constructive criticisms/suggestions.

GAME SUGGESTIONS:

- Option to prevent friendly-fire/attack against allied units.  This isn't an issue with zombie followers but is with every other class.  I know there's a level trait that prevents this but would be nice to just make it a standard option you opt in/out of in the main settings or maybe make it a mutator.  

- Add some kind of permanent stat increase functionality.  Something similar to ""Rogue Legacy"" where you can use skill points (or nuggets, in this case) to increase certain base stats by a single point, for all characters, thus, eventually your base stats get high enough that you're no longer struggling through the first levels and can focus more on just getting further in the game.

- Allow the ability to skip forward.  I've only been able to make it to the nature level (trees, lakes, Cannibals everywhere) with my friend but haven't been able to make it solo.  Would be cool to be able to just skip ahead once you've reached certain levels.

- Give every class a special ability.  Special abilities are really fun and truly give those classes a re-usable skill that vastly changes your approach to combat and problem solving.",True

"Okay so, Poncho is amazing in two cathegorys: It's visuals and its really, REALLY great Soundtrack.

Here is what doesn't work.



Gameplay:

In Poncho the player moves in three layers, lets call them front, back and middle. With two buttons the player jumps between them but can only jump one layer at the time. Most navigation of the levels and even most of the puzzles of the levels are pretty fun and relaxing. You are not limited in lives and if you fail a jump Poncho respawns at the last solid piece of ground he had jumped off from. That was a good decision as it takes the edge of some  of the games problems. 

None the less the game becomes a play in frustration when it starts to introduce platforms/blocks that change between these levels as well platforms/that move between the layers when the player does. 
Many of these are a problem because the front layer can often barely be seen wich makes knowing the rythm of movement a guesswork. Often i mastered these more by brutforcing it. This makes apparent that the mechanics and some of these puzzles are clearly not well enough designed. Three times i managed to more or less break the game and maneuver into a situation that i only could get out off via leaving the level.





Content:

Poncho has not enough content whatsoever. In only 3.5 hours i am pretty sure i have seen everything. After finishing the game it mostly felt as if they had stopped developing in the middle of the process.

For example around the third level Poncho gains the abbillity to stonp down and open up secret areas. The whole thing is barely even used, a handfull of times at most. And that counts for every part of the game.

The biggest insult though is the claim that Poncho is a game of exploration. But i talk about that in the last point.





Story:

The game claims that the player explores the world to discover the secret behind the faith of the world in ruins as well as the origins of Poncho.

That is simply false. The levels, while beautifull to look at, are there to be traversed, that is it. There are no secrets or artefacts to discover that may tell you what happened. The same counts for the robts you encounter. Even the most prominent of these add NOTHING to your understanding of the world and Ponchos place therein.

But it gets worse. Bercause all there is to discover is a few words at the beginning and a big text dump at the end.

And lets talk about that ending. In NO WAY has the gamne earned it's attempt at a heavy ending. Because the world has nothing to discover it ends up feeling like we have the very beginning and the very end of the story, no built up, no hints we could have guessed what was or is going on and most of all not enough infos to make the binary decision at the end.

I mean NONE of it makes sense anyway.



SPOILER! (although there really isn't anything worthwhile)

Tuns out Poncho is the son of the person that caused the end of humanity (the game shows us that by giving that person also a poncho to wear over a labcoar wich is ridiculous). To prevent Poncho from disappearing he changed him into a robot and then gave him his heart. 
He then went into the Red Tower and built himself a machine so he could stay alive (we see him connected to that machine via a breathingmask) to try and change the fate of humanity and bring them back (the games makes clear that since then a loooong time has pased).

To be able to bring back humanity Poncho needs to give him his heart back so the Father can move freely. That means that Poncho would die.

The player can then decide to give him his heart back so he can restore humanity and die or keep the heart and with the last human (we never get to learn his name btw.) humanity dies forever.

If the player chooses to die, we witness how poncho gets bared up and then in a scene that suggest that all the robots had been humans changes the robiots we have seen into humans.
If the player choolses to live we see the Proffessor/Father/Guy bared up and the robots besids Poncho standing last guard next to him. 
In both scenes the world afterwards makes a undeserved ""everything end eventually"" ending that it didn't deserve to make and that also makes no sense the way it shows.


NONE OF THIS MAKES SENSE!

What kind of machine is that, that could make the world a better place, but also can kill ALL OF HUMANITY if ""something goes wrong"". We never get ANY idea of that!

Why did he give Poncho his heart? 

When Ponchos memory got wiped in the process, doesn't that mean he died anyway? 

Great job killing your son (and humanity), dad! Twice! 

So he can't move from that machine without his heart?

How did he even reach the tower if he would have died without a heart? 

Has he ever heard of the concept of EXTENSION CABLES? 

Or for that matter, humanity was clearly technologically advanced. How about  an artificial heart? We have those TODAY!

Or how about using that massive restless ARMY OF ROBOTS THAT WANT TO SERVE SOMEONE?

And why not give that artificial heart to Poncho in the first place? 

Why leave Poncho back somewhere in a massive ruined city and not take him with him?

How the hell did you get your hearth out by yourself anyways?

Or a transportable version of that machine. 

I mean you clearly must have had several decadees if not even hundreds of years for making something like that seeing how overgrown the world has become!

---------------------------------------------------------

There are more things that make no sense but the end of the song is that Poncho neither has earned such a heavy ending nor did it do it any form of real worldbuilding to support it.

Simply, Breath-taking",True
"I recommend this game, but beware that matchmaking is poor in certain regions. I live in Asia and can never find games. If you are going to get this game, bring friends or do not bother at all.

That said, the game does have surprising depth for the price and genre. At least in the beginning, there is a ""correct"" way to play each character that synergizes with the characters strengths. Of course you can play each character however you want, but with starting gear each character should be played according to their own roles. The dwarf, for example, is best played with a shield to block enemies and protect the team. You can definitely play him with a good two-hander as well. The playstyle becomes altogether different and team composition needs to be tweaked accordingly.

Aside from this, there are two things to note. The game is definitely a gear grind. If you dont like that, avoid it at all costs. Also, sometimes with latency the hit detection becomes a little questionable - you will swear you hit things but it just wont register.

Otherwise, the art direction, level design and all other aspects of the game are great and I highly recommend it. Just wish the multiplayer were more accessible.",True

"How do you accurately, genuinely review and analyze a game that has such an absurd wealth of content, it can't even all be played in one go? That's the challenge I face with penning this review, but it's a challenge I'm willing to face for the sake of recommending an absolutely [i]brilliant[/i] RPG. I've never been a stranger to games of yesteryear--especially when said games become shackled with the poisoinous phrase: ""it aged badly""--as if a game can age at all. With every old game I complete, this phrase becomes more and more meaningless, with Morrowind being no different.

Combat in Morrowind is a [i]very[/i] touchy subject whenever the game is brought up--many are quick to complain about the fact that your weapons can ""miss"" when fighting enemies, but I never found this to be a problem, personally. The entire game is based around a DnD framework-- dice rolls and all.When you understand this and accept that you're going to have to put in work to raise your stats and skills up, the combat gradually becomes much more palatable. You'll start out swinging your blade into the air or embarrassingly failing to cast your spells, but over the progression of the game and your character, you'll soon swing with such ferocity that flesh will be but butter to your hot blade, or you'll soon cast spells of such mass destruction and speed that enemies will only be able to be identified by the ashes of where they once stood. 

Another complain levied against Morrowind is its lack of fast travel and quest markers--and these complaints, to me, are only half acceptable. As far as fast travel is concerned, Morrowind far outshines its sequels [i]Oblivion[/i] and [i]Skyrim[/i] with the way transportation is handled, and it mildly infuriates me that these systems did not carry over at all. That is, nearly every city has a method of transportation to other cities, whether they be Silt Striders across land or vessels across water (and sometimes, both!). The several Mage's Guilds scattered across Vvardenfell all have mages willing to teleport you around, and, speaking of mages, there are several spells and enchantments that allow you to get around without even interacting with NPCs: the combination of ""Mark"" and ""Recall"" allow you to ""save"" a spot and teleport to it whenever you please, and the two ""Intervention"" spells (Almsivi and Divine) whisk you away from danger and drop you off at the nearest temple or cult shrine, respectively. 

As for quest markers, this has the [i]potential[/i] to be a problem, but is not always so. Finding specific persons is relatively simple as NPCs do not have schedules in Morrowind and, as such, are generally found in whatever location other NPCs will tell you. As for finding specific dungeons, caves, and the likes (to fulfill a quest, of course), the lack of a quest marker can get shaky. Most questlines do, in fact, offer you very good directions that can bring you right to your desired location while other questlines only offer you a vague idea of where a dungeon may be, such as a simple ""yeah, it's north of town, I guess"" while some may even give you completely incorrect directions! This can be annoying, but there [i]are[/i] only a handful of quests that do this--thankfully, the [b]Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages[/b] wiki and trusty Google Images can pinpoint a location for you if you absolutely can't find it yourself.

I realize now as I write this review that I've only really spent the past four paragraphs [i]defending[/i] this game rather than recommending it, but what exactly am I supposed to do? Morrowind was lavished with praise upon release and there are thousands of positive critical acclaim floating around even today, but much less so in the face of a wake of gamers who feel themselves unable to even touch Morrowind because, again, ""it's aged poorly"". I suppose the real point of this review is to directly challenge those claims and ask that it still be given a chance. [i]Look.[/i] Morrowind is a game of brilliant writing, with its main story being the [b]very[/b] best of the Elder Scrolls and its lore absolutely sublime as a brilliant burst of creativity in a genre all too stuck on Tolkien. Its world is surreal and bizarre, its land and dungeons are handcrafted, its options for player choice and decisions are brilliant, and its soundtrack is an invitation to explore the ash covered, mushroom sprouted Imperial Province of Vvardenfell. 

If you can climb your way through the leveling process--if you can follow the directions you are given--if you can look beyond the graphical capability of a 2003 video game--then Morrowind is a genuine adventure waiting to be experienced.",True

"[b]W.I.P Review - (Work In Progress)[/b]

Firstly since Black Ops 2 comes as 3 separate games on your Steam Games List when you buy it (Black Ops 2 - Campaign, Black Ops 2 Multiplayer & Black Ops 2 Zombies) i will be reviewing them all here split into thier own sections to make it easier to see which part of the game i will be reviewing.

[h1]Black Ops 2 - Campaign[/h1]

The campaign to this game is really good in my opinion, i have thoroughly enjoyed pretty much every mission.  The story line is not too bad and links in with previous story lines from Treyarcs CoD games.  The graphics i run at maximun are not too bad either but there are parts of various missions in which there are most certainly texture issues or misplaced objects which you can see in my steam screenshots for this game.

The campaign is as with every other CoD just as explosive and violent with so much variety in the scenery or vehicles you can use etc.  One thing i do like in this campaign is being able to use an Access Kit during every mission, which allows access to various perks such as Drones, ASD's or CLAW's (Military Automated Units) and also things like Flak Jackets for reduced explosive damage and alternative Melee weapons.  Some parts are as with previous CoD's overly excessive with violence but it doesnt make the game any less fun in my opinion.

Also as with many previous CoD games there are Intel's to collect in each mission, however something i liked in this game is that there are two versions of Intel - One for missions based in the Past, and one version for the missions based in the Future. There are also Challenges for each mission which if completed allow access to more perks and more powerful weapons to use in the missions ahead or previous missions if you use the Replay Mission feature (after completing story).

The last feature i do like in this game was the ability to choose your weapons setup before starting a mission. You are able to choose both a primary and secondary weapon of your choosing with up to 3 attachments too.  Then you can also choose your grenades and perks too. Some grenades, weapons or perks are required to do the challenges in the game but sometimes those particular missions would also have the required weapon laying around nearby. Also challenges are not necessary to complete so its not super important if you dont take any particular weapon, grenade or perk.

[b]Achievements[/b] - Achievements are also separate for each part of this game, the Achievements for the campaign part are all pretty straightforward, the most difficult being to complete every single challenge in every single mission including the StrikeForce missions.

[b]Cons[/b]

The bad points i have picked up on having played this game are as follows:

- [b]Lag[/b] 

For some unknown reason at some point in pretty much every single mission i had huge lag spikes where my FPS (Frames Per Second) would drop to like 2 FPS.  I have an absoloute beast of a computer and could run max graphics 100% of the time with no issues but these random lag spikes hit for like upto around 15 seconds where i can barely turn or anything because its going so slow.  Its not based on internet in this case as its purely singleplayer even if you disconnect internet and play its the same issue.  Fortunately this only happens about once on every map for no more than 15 seconds and may have not happened at all some times.  The only reason i say every mission is because i have played through each mission multiple times to get every challenge complete for the achievements.

- [b]Cinematics[/b]

This game has ALOT of cinematics, and they are very good and work well alongside the missions and quite often during the missions.  Therefore i have absoloutly no issue with the cinematics at all and this should not put the average player off at all.  However, if you are attempting to do EVERY SINGLE CHALLENGE in order to get EVERY SINGLE ACHIEVEMENT, you have to play through each mission multiple times and it takes a very long time watching the cinematics over and over again.  Some you can skip fairly quickly, sometimes you have to watch for like 30 seconds before it can be skipped and you can start the mission.  But the in-game cinematics 9 times out of 10 cant be skipped and takes forever to just continue with the mission to get your challenges or whatever.  

Would be very nice to just have instantly skippable cinematics when using the Replay Mission feature after having completed the story at least once. Watching the same cinematic however many times it takes you to do some of the challenges is just not fun :P

- [b]A.I. / StrikeForce Challenges[/b]

The A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) units for this game are not too bad for the main campaign, you probably wont have a problem with them. However the A.I. in the StrikeForce Missions are absoloutly terrible and make them almost unplayable. I have completed all 5 StrikeForce missions in the Tactical View only for the Challenge required for the Achievement, and occasionally the A.I. just dont move ever, they get stuck and they stand until they die.  Having said that, the StrikeForce missions i have done in Tactical View were pretty straightforward and i did the challenge first time. 

The mission 'Shpwrecked' even on Recruit difficulty seems to be impossible to do due to A.I. not doing anything at all, or dying almost instantly to enemy soldiers or ASD's. They don't attack enemies en route to waypoints, they just run straight past them, so they die.  You do seem to have to really work to get them to kill things and defend properly in this one mission. 

I have completed this mission with very little difficulty having finally gotten around to it, at the time i completed it, i had quite a large force of soldiers, ASD's and a claw all fairly close to each other so they seemed to protect each other from dying so easily.  Once the Tactical View Challenge is done for all StrikeForce missions the rest of the challenges are a breeze. 

One thing i will note to help others in completing challenges is that you do NOT need to successfully complete the mission so you can spend as long as you like 'running over soldiers with an ASD' for example until time runs out and you fail the mission if thats what it takes.



[h1]Black Ops 2 - Multiplayer[/h1]

Haven't really played this enough to review just yet - W.I.P

[b]Achievements[/b] - There are only 5 achievements for this part of the game, they appear to be very straightforward and one should not have a problem getting all of the achievements with probably less than 30 hours played. Assuming you physically try to get them as you do have to play in certain playlists to get 3 of them.  The other two being reach level 10 and reaching Prestige for the 1st time.

[b]Achievements[/b] - The Achievements for this part of the game if you want all of them DO REQUIRE ALL DLC, otherwise you can only get about 1/4 of them.

"Don't mind the negativiy of whatever people say about this game.
here's what i have experienced since lvl 1 to lvl 29.
started as nothing more than a clueless player with no knowledge what to do, where to go and how to act in the middle of the whole confusion i got parachuted into. starting levels it has been fun and easy, but as I went and levelled the hell out of myself i got to say that i became to love the game with every bulled i shoot. Yes, sometimes it gets frustrating, getting killed by some boss, but that is where the fun is, you don't have only one way in playing this game. Everything, and i mean EVERYTHING plays a role. Doesn't matter if you are lvl 25 or 29, enemies with lvl 23 kick your arsenal so hard that you WILL have to consider and/or find a different aproach. Every single skill, grenade and even cover plays a role in your survival. it is not hard to solo the whole content, as long as you know what you're doing, and your surroundings, have a backup escape route in case things go south. Gear is the key to your success, get better gear, mods, and time your things right and you will get to like it.
A lot of things to explore, collectibles, wardrobe to personalize how your character looks like, storyline, ECHOES, listen to phone calls, it's all amazing and interesting. Also the graphics and level of detail in either streets or apartments is beyond my explanation. It still amazes me every time i play it. I strongly recommend this game to everyone who was interested before. I have been following it since it was announced and finally decided to buy it, and I do not regret a single cent. Grouping with others is optional, as well as Dark Zone (elite enemies and pvp in one), so have fun, and good luck :D",True

"First things first, this remaster is aiming to be as close to the original as possible with a few welcomed features from previous dark souls titles so no massive overhaul of graphics or completely changing interfaces because that's not how DS1 was, the graphics sucked ass and the UI was atrocious.

A remake is taking the original idea and twisting it into it's own seperate version like super graphics overhaul and UI fixes

This is a REMASTER point blank.

I recommend this game over the original, it keeps to the classic style of Dark Souls 1 and adds a few welcomed features but it doesn't stray very far from vanilla version.

"Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a story-driven action adventure RPG, taking place in a cyberpunk future ruled by scientific breakthroughs and corporate greed. You play as Adam Jenson, an ex-cop turned fully-augmented head of security for one of the worldwide leading companies in technological advancement, Sarif Industries. You'll travel the globe, sneak into top-secret enemy facilities, and eventually unearth a conspiracy hidden to the public eye. Needless to say, the story of Human Revolution is very deep; the game deals heavily with themes regarding humanity, freedom, and limitation, and has you questioning the morality of scientific advancement in post-modern society. While it takes a while to set up an engaging story, the game keeps you playing based simply on its fascinating vision of the not-too-far-off future. The choices you encounter along the way effect the story in meaninful ways as well. In short, Human Revolution may not feature the most emotionally compelling story ever in a video game, but easily one of the most intriguing. 

Human Revolution can be completed in two differing ways; by sneaking past all your enemies stealthily, or going guns-blazing into every encounter. Because the level design is incredibly well done, both approaches are commendable. I usually prefer the stealthy approach, but only because it's more rewarding and has more features available. As you level up, you'll earn Praxis Kits, which  upgrade your augmentations. Let me just say that no game I've played has offered as many useful upgrades as are available here. The game also has a hacking element, which is basically a simple minigame. However, hacking also acts as one of the unsung approaches of Human Revolution; you can disable cameras, gain access to secret files, and even turn programmed turrets on your enemies. Enemy AI as well is usually pretty intelligent. Any time that I think I've been spotted while stealthing, enemies will most definitely have spotted me. Overall, the gameplay here is fairly well thought-out and challenging.

Overall, Deus Ex is the cyberpunk game that I've always wanted, but never had the chance to play. While it's definitely built as a stealth title, players used to the combat approach will still have a fun time. The soundtrack might I add is also amazingly good. On a final note, the Director's Cut merely includes a DLC expansion into the main story, adding about an hour or two of additional gameplay, though it's still worth it. If you're into conspiracy-heavy plots, cyberpunk settings, or just a well-built stealth game, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is the ideal game for you.

9/10 - Worth it at current asking price (Definitely get during a sale of you're not too sure how you'll enjoy the game).",True

Game of the year.",True
"This title is the same as the first Vermintide, buggy enemy and friendly ai, terrible level design, and an overall general gameplay imbalance. 

The game itself starts off fun, however in order to progress and get better and rarer equipment, you must play on harder difficulties. The idea is that you must first level your characters so that they can be effective teammates when fighting along side them (basically you need to level your bots by playing as them). This is actually a great feature as it teaches the player how to use the characters properly, design builds for them, and play to their strengths!

Unfortunately, the flaw in the design is the fact that the AI are still useless on any difficulty higher than Veteran difficulty unless you are using mods, hacks, trainers, or other illicit means in order to survive. So the ""endgame"" is locked behind playing with random players found online. This too however is not viable as not many do play anymore (can't blame them) and most are just as bad as bots if not worse. Unless you have a dedicated team of 4, the game is unplayable if you want to progress to the ""endgame"". 

Now being totally honest, nothing is forcing the player to attempt harder difficulties however, if you are the kind of player that enjoys the feel of progression, this game may actually be for you as I thought it was for me! It's fun to level the characters to their max level until you have a team of 4 maxed ""powerful"" characters. 

However, you'll soon realize that leveling them was a waste of time as they cannot survive on anything higher than Veteran difficulty legitimately no matter their build or gear. In a sick sense, it is quite comical to watch 3 ""heros"" that you have been leveling up to be more helpful, get torn apart by a small group of rats and be reduced to nothing in moments. Do not be fooled by guides on the internet claiming to have great bot builds or strategies, nothing works and they are useless due to poor defensive/offensive capabilities and poor pathing. 

In conclusion, I feel like i got my money's worth. I got this on the steam summer sale for around $7 which is about what the game is worth for a single playthrough of the small amount of levels that are present in the vanilla game. DO NOT purchase the map dlc, its hardly any more maps (three of which you already played in the first game, if god forbid you actually played it)  and nothing about the maps make them worth what they are asking even during the summer sale. 

If you want a co-op style of game and you are not sure about this one, Left 4 Dead and Payday 2 are also 4 player co-op focused and are much better balanced than this one. I would still recommend Vermintide 2 while it's on sale though! It really is worth playing at least once. Just don't expect to see any returns or benefits for sinking time into this title.",False

"Interesting, but flawed game. (as most are eh?) RPG aspects are quite good although some game mechanics and puzzle designs are obtuse. Some interactions require an absurd amount of trial/error unless you check up a guide beforehand. 

Combat and dialogue is the main forte of this game. That said, the combat suffers from enemies taking really long turns at times which gets exacerbated when the average enemy count later in the game rises to 6-10+ish. The biggest offender while not every battle is when an enemy decides to take 40s - 1m+ to just sit there and decide to make no moves while not cc'd and with full ability/action points. There's decent world building and several secrets within the game with a somewhat excessive focus on humor in nearly every line.

There are tons of build options (all viable, but naturally some are easier/better than others), but you will probably want to build a somewhat balanced group as varying resistances/armors/crowd control effects will otherwise make for lengthy difficult battles. Nothing too memorable for the music tracks yet their ambience really immerses you into the dungeon delving setting the mood perfectly. At times dark and brooding, at other times bright and bombastic to inspire a heroes' journey.

Due to some nonsensical interactions and wonky AI at times, the game length feels like it overstays its welcome. Pacing and level progression could have used alot more tweaking as it felt necessary to do most sidequests to keep leveled and geared properly. 

If you're looking for a fairly traditional RPG with a proper timesink it's more than worth the time and money. I'd rather give it a mixed because of the sluggish AI turn times/halts and absurd puzzles.",True

"This game tries to be a fast paced combat flight simulator. The game attempts to provide the player with a large sandbox with several targets and objects to shoot and destroy.

The issue I have is not that it is graphically simplistic (it appears it's only for the aesthetic, and not even for higher frame rates or anything), the issue is not that the game is poorly set out or that menus are atrrocious.
The issue I have is that the game is not fun.

After working the unintuitive camera and targeting system, you line up a shot and blow up enemy jets only to see a 2D explosion and the simple model slowly move down from where it was. The buildings when shot produce a particle effect and are absorbed into the ground at a rate comparible to osmosis.
Then there's what you're doing. You have little idea what's shooting at you, and often it appears as if you're killed by an enemy sneezing at you.

In the game blurb at the top of the store page the last phrase ""when you die, you're dead"" is a silly tautology that makes little sence. But once you play the game realise that what that means is when you're shot down, your progress is reset and you start all over again.

That fits into the next part, the dificulty curve. Following the tutorial that a 3 year old could probably complete, you're thrown into a mission that has everything set up against you, enemy jets, SAMs, etc. So you have to go thorugh securing air superiority, then dominating the ground, THEN you can go and strafe at the mission dependent target.

More or less, the issue I have is not that this game is in Early Access and that so many parts of what I didn't like would change, my issue is that the core gameplay mechanic was not fun, it was not satisfying and importantly wasn't rewarding enough. This is why I think you probably should be sceptical of this game and really consider if you really want it.",False

"I whish I could fully express how much I love this game.

It has the most flexibility of any game I've ever played. This is, of course, keeping mods in mind. It has anything you can think of and probably more.

If you want to just play the base game, that's fine. You can be a badass battle mage, or a sneaky assassin or eaven Aela the Huntress the Second. You may take a wife or a husband. You can have kids and live a peaceful life (just kidding, that's probably the one thing you can't do. ""Can't"" being used a little loosely.)

If you want a challenge you can choose legendary difficulty, and believe me, the accomplishement feels great.
You feel yourself get stronger as you play. The first time you pick a fight with a giant you are almost sure to loose, but later you kill those easier than killing rabbits.

If you want to go on hunting trips like a normal hunter, there's room for that too.

I just feel like almost everything this game offers is something I want. It is not as complex as you might later wish for it to be, but that's when the mods come in. I won't start on that or I'll never finish.

- Vanilla graphics are pretty terrible. Bethesda could have really upped their texture game without too much frame loss. It does feel more rural that way though.
- Guards will forever have their heads up their own asses. No matter hoe powerfull or famous you should be.
- Caves and Tombs do become repetitive, but I still found them fun, even after 100 of them.
- If you are a horder, going on long journeys may fill up your quite-large-to-start-with inventory, which is a slight annoyance, but inevitable.
- Main story line lacks a certain urgency.
- This is a Bethesda game... there are bugs. (BUT most of them have fixes! :D )

Pros:
- Gameplay feels smooth. Combat actually depends on what you do (block, stepping back, sneaking etc.)
- Incredibly many ways to play the game. Could cater for anyone.
- LOOOOOOT. I love loot and there is lots of it here. Like lots.
- Crafting actually means something in this game. Not too much from the start, but endgame crafting will get you better gear than you can find.
- Side quests are a lot of fun.
- Replayability is also good.
- The sheer amount of mods makes this game 150% better.
- Gameplay time is huge. You can rack in hundreds of hours.
- Lore is great.
- Console commands are readily available to the player. It helps sometimes and gives even MORE flexibility.

There's more I could say, but that's the gist of it. Worth the money? YES. Incredibly so.
Would i reccomend the DLCs? Also yes.
Hearthfire if you like aesthetics, like me. Also like feeling rich and like you've accomlished a lot, like me.
Dawnguard for a few more hours of gameplay. The storyline for Dawnguard is almost better than the original game. More eerie, but more personal.

"One of the best multiplayer co-op games I've ever played. The learning curve can be hard at first, but the game feels rewarding no matter what level you are.

"Considering the majority of recent negative reviews come from people [i]with hundrets of hours played[/i] being butthurt about recent balance patches, you should take the now ""mixed"" reviews with a grain of salt.

This game is also priced at [b]half[/b] of an AAA title, while still delivering AAA content. 
Are negative reviews actually justified/weighted, when the ""major"" problem right now is weapon/class balance, which won't even matter until long after getting your money's worth? I don't think so.

The game is a ton of fun. Especially with friends.
The gameplay is smooth, the combat is very satisfying. 
Latency is not a problem in near/medium search range. Nor is finding matches in said range.

Toxicity is actually minimal, as long as you play the way the game is intended. Running off alone and getting ganked isn't getting you any friends regardless of the game.

Graphics have improved greatly from VT1 and just have received major optimization (20gb patch). 

Gore has been improved to the point of actually dropping my jaw from time to time (sidesweeping a greatsword, cutting a clan rat precisely in half exactly where the sword went through, then both ""parts"" dropping physically correct to the ground with a satisfying *thud*).

"I played Fallout 4 on my PS4 where it ran fine other than the usual Bethesda crashing feature.

Apparently on PC i have run afoul of a known issue where Fallout is unable to detect the video hardware or display the game correctly on most new graphics cards, including the entire Nvidia 10XX series like my card, and there are apparently no fixes and never will be.  The Bethesda support page wont even talk about it that i have seen.  Steam forums are full of unhelpful ""update drivers, Verify cache"" nonsense, as if i HAVEN'T already run the standard gauntlet of routine fixes.  I wouldn't be on the forums if any of the routine checklist had worked.

Its clear that this is an issue inherent in the game itself and originates with the publisher's shoddy work, not the users PC's, and with Bethesda's recent behavior regarding the Fallout series and their treatment of their fans i have now lost all faith in the publisher.  


UPDATE:  Finally, after great effort, a new card, a new screen and a Cyber Monday sale that made the risk of trying again cheap enough to be worth it i can finally play the game as it was intended (or at all).  And 200+ hours later i cannot put the game down.

But this is NOT thanks to the publishers.  This is thanks ENTIRELY to the efforts and hard work of a tireless community of mad-folk publishing patches and mods to do what the developers SHOULD have done in the first place.

If you want to try this game, i strongly recommend getting it on sale for dirt cheap and sending the REAL money to the Patreon pages of the modders.  They deserve your money a thousand times more than BaThEsDa ever did.",True

"On the fence on recommending this.  It's good for wrestling fans... however, the in-game roster is lack-luster, and unlike wrestling games of yesteryear, there's not really much in the way of storylines/cutscenes.  The game tries to make conflicts/feuds... but more or less a match happens, where occasionally stuff can happen in those matches if the people are in a feud, and that's for the most part it.

"In all fairness this IS a good game, in story and gameplay... its only the frustrating game level designs, and plot elments that hold it back.  I would give it a ""Mixed"" but that is not an option.  I wont get into the gameplay differences between HM1 and HM2 which makes this game much more frustrating, dealing with more blind corners, windows, and long hallways so get used to getting shot from enemies you cant see on the map, but its the story and how much effort the devs put in to give the audience what it DIDNT want.  That is where I draw the line.  

*SPOILERS*

They know we wanted to see Jacket return as a playable character, they teased us with him showing up in the background in several cutscenes, throughout the game.  You never do, he's a big FU.  And worst of all, they know ""The Fans"" are the most interesting characters, the most visually flashy, and play almost completely different from the rest of the game!  You not only are they unique and interesting individually, but they come as a team letting you pick between them for each mission, that is after you unlock them one by one... you spend a total of 1 mission where you have all 4 unlocked on your first playthrough before they are taken away from you.  Not only are they no longer available to play as, but they are gone early on, less then halfway through the game, forcing you to try and care about Manny Pardo, the journalist and Richter to carry the ""story"" through its final leg.  Each of these characters play very similiar to one another, the only dramatic difference between the three is that the journalist doesnt like killing which gives him a unique non lethal approach unless you chose otherwise.  But this just forces you to play a game, where your favorite parts were gone before you got a chance to truly enjoy them, and now you have to play hours and hours of frustrating levels with characters that are less interesting both plot and gameplay mechanics wise (Until The Son levels which are indeed amazing, so the finale does end with a bang)  Which brings us to the ending cutscene.  They know we would want a sequel... they ended the game with that all but impossible, so the world wont even live on.

So this all begs the question, why did they do this?  Why did they make their game less satisfying in both plot, style AND gameplay?  It seems like its purely to be unexpected.  That everyone would EXPECT them to make a game the people who bought it wanted, so they did the opposite to be... creative?  I dont find that to be a great reason, and I personally stopped caring about the plot half way through the game, only to pick back up towards the end, then saw the world and lore I truly admired go up in flames.  It all felt insulting, and since there's no ""Mixed"" Ill give it a thumbs down.",False

"This game isnt worth a dime on it's cheapest day. Go obtain it through other means if you really want to play it. 

If you buy it... all you're doing is giving money to developers so they can live a better life than you. So when they come home they can work on their hobby. They're getting in the best shape of their lives and sailing boats. While you play a incomplete mess. And hang a false hope that this game will ever be finish or become better. They waste time on dumb shit like painting or screwing up the skill tree instead of adding things like bandits. Or improving the difficultly of the game. 

And then when you start to call them out on all their bs. Like as to why the game is taking so long or what have they've been doing? Their mods will mock you and then ban you for being ""disrespectful"". Which brings me to another point. They were so transparent with what they were working on. Now that is gone and updates are slowing to a complete halt. 

I'm sure the silence will break once they have to pull the money leaver cause they're running low in income to sail boats. Or make another false advertising trailer to sucker all the little kiddies in. So they can cash into a incomplete game. 

As to gameplay. It sucks. This game is a hording simulator. All you do is deal with zombies that are easily handled once you get the hang of the game. Then you just start to horde plentiful amount of loot that spawns every 7 or more days. (Depending on settings of course) Your base will be most likely on the surface since developers have no real solution to deal with players that build underground. Which they've nearly destroyed at this stage of the game. Cause zombies can dig straight to your base like a homing missile. 

And don't expect much from PVP when you go online. You're either prey or a apex hording predator with infinite purple gear at your disposal. (Purple gear is the best gear you can get in the game) With a full concert base that towers into the sky surrounded by a trench full of spikes. And is buffed 20x from damage when a player is offline cause of the landmark. So mutiplayer sucks cause it's neglected by the developers. Cause the main dev only plays single player cause he sucks at playing his own game. [url=https://7daystodie.com/forums/image.php?u=4&dateline=1570466850]Cause the dude is getting ripped in then gym and sailing on boats.[/url]  Yes, that's a developer.

So stay clear away from Multiplayer unless you plan on playing co-op. Or if you like getting your stuff you horded taken away from either hackers or corrupt admins or that apex predator. 

Yup this game doesn't have much to offer. And it cannot make up it's mind whether or not it wants to be a casual arcade or realistic post apocalyptic survival game. Just another idiots game, ""just survive"".  Dev's are living it up and their mods are there to manage the sheep. If you're not part of the hive mind then you are exiled.  It will only be another 17 years till this game is finished. So dev's can probably work on 8 days to die or something. So they can keep sailing on the those boats and getting ripped at the gym.",False

"NEW REVIEW (original comments further down):

Look, it is entertaining, but it eventually hit all sorts of buttons I don't want to see in a game. I mean, I had fun at first because I was warned about the speed thing, but it took me until the end of the game to see how bad it was. My biggest complaint is too much 'illusion.' Illusion of Sandbox, Illusion of character capability (primarily the illusion of meaning in having a level thirty combat skill), Illusion that i wouldn't have my time wasted by pointless drivel.

What do I mean when I say illusion of sandbox? Unless you know exactly what you are doing, you are following a pretty linear path laid out for you of: these guys are too strong for me right now, I'll go explore that other road. 

Hell, it even applies to leveling some of the character classes, even if some are more problematic than others:
Explorer - The PC of the game, given most of the secondary skills eventually but they don't get to rise as quickly as specialists, just to give you an excuse to want those specialists and spread the combat uselessness to the rest of the party. Required, nuff said. 1 speed EVERY level, split the other between agility+strength until you can wield your chosen weapon to max tier. Recommend the fighter/Barbarian uses the axe and Gaulen uses either sword or bow with envenom. skip aimed attack, that's what the axe/halberd fighter is for.

Barbarian - I screwed up with this guy, thinking combat initiative was combat speed and dumped a great many points into something nearly useless at endgame. Weapon master would have been way more effective at the level i got tactics to. Recommend axes, the two-hander has a lower agility requirement than swords which means you can go back to straight Speed/Strength every level a little faster. again 1 speed EVERY level, split the other between strength and agility like gaulen. 

Mage - The least useful at the end of the game IMO, all the good spells have ridiculous costs when fully leveled and with them you're facing enemies with equally ridiculous resistances. Don't get me wrong, there is a spot for them but I almost believe you would be better off with an Arcane Soldier. Best spells to max are energy absorption (during long fights can eventually drain most enemy wizards of their power points and render them a useless at 0 cost) and brittle armor. All others are a case by case basis for your build. 1 SPEED/1 ENERGY every level. Are you seeing a pattern?

Bard - The problem child. I mentioned before that they got the worst of both worlds? I was right. Choices are Sword or Bow, and songs are immediate range only. When compared to the enemy version that throws shuriken and targets all enemies, I am more convinced than ever that those tools were removed from the player version to pigeonhole them and keep them from being awesome when combined with a Divine Summoner. They get a series of four songs unlocked over their levels Courage, Rage, Spirit, and Haste I believe. Do not put a single skill point into any of these. The final song they get is Song of Victory and it'll bring all of those previous songs up at the level of song of victory regardless of what you got them to in game. In short, a waste of points to even bother with the precursors. This is a hard one, though, 1 Speed/1 split between energy, strength, agility until you get them using your preferred weapon, then energy all the way. If you have him/her using a bow, i recommend aimed shot gets maxed along with L30 weapon. Mercantile and helps stretch your funds and is one of the other reasons I prize them over the Mage. That and Requiem.

Cleric - Honestly feels like a mess. Their final spells make them way more important end-game than the mage foe the most part as 90% of what you're fighting at that point feels like undead and demons with a few others thrown in to spice up the matches. 1 Speed/1 Energy.

Divine Summoner - Falls behind hard if you screw up, definitely broken. 1 Speed/1 Energy. Expect summons to be one-shot.


Personally, I would have removed speed as a stat to increase. Easier to design the fights that way. Probably would have opened up variations on best build as well.



Old Review: Hmm, hard to comment on this one, but I like it overall. On one hand, it has a lot of elements and attention to detail that I like to see in a game. On the other, well, it may be sandbox in intent but it is linearly set-up in the extreme so far. I mean, there are at most two paths you can reliably tread at any given point so far, with every single other one blocked off by enemies so tough that they can usually one-shot you. There may be ways around some of them, but that usually returns back to having one or two paths you can take to fight enemies scaled to your level (keep in mind that this is on the intended difficulty level of 'Normal').

The players characters are a mixed bag. Haven't played with some of them, but so far the primary rule is that if you mess up with whatever build you are going for then you are eventually going to be too weak to fight effectively against the things that are thrown at you. I'll go over the classes:

Soldier - haven't played this one, seems straight-forward.

Mage - Relatively weak in the early levels, doesn't really come into their power until at least level eight (sooner if you plan it right and know which spells you are picking up from the beginning). One of the best upgrades you can give them are a bunch of Constitution increasing items so they aren't one-shot by certain enemies. 

Thief - Obviously intended to be in every single party - Has the easiest means of keeping pick locks and disarm trap maxed out alongside the shuriken skill in order to make your life easier. works best as a dodge tank, and seems to be the only character able to wield shurikens which are the easiest and fastest way that I have seen to inflict massive bleed damage.

Cleric - Always nice to have a healer, but takes a while to obtain all the prayers that handle the various status afflictions. I seriously recommend always having one around.

Divine Summoner - Can summon various relatively powerful being to fight on the party's side. can have two summons at any given time that can use their own power reserves to aid the party. Useful, but Herald of Golot seems to be the most powerful one no matter how useless he is in the fight itself (he literally generates either extra money or random gear).

Paladin - Works best as a back-up healer so you can level up his unique aura abilities and get multi-player heal and defense increases well before the Cleric can.

Barbarian - The flat out basic fighter. consists of equip him and press the attack option.

Bard - Weaker than the mage early on and focused a lot more on non-combat skills. it takes a while, or a lot of mana potions, for him to be a powerful addition to the team. Should have been allowed the shuriken skill to give him an offensive option like the villain version. I assume people thought this was too powerful or broken. What I've got is a relatively poor non-fighter that can't keep up and seems to be getting the worst of both worlds.

Arcane Soldier - Similar to the Paladin, they should focus on their unique abilities. seem to work best as a bowman so you can reach out and touch the guy in the back row.


irritations:
I have no means that I am aware of to keep track of 'Zone Clears' automatically on the map. Yes, there are player note tags, but there are so many distinct sub-areas that I honestly can't seem to keep them separated at this point for keeping track of those.

A single shop that randomly generates it's weapons/armor. This is pretty common in a lot of games, but it's implementation is irritating. Seriously, I have two characters in the group that are literally waiting to come across a bronze grade weapon so they can upgrade their gear (this might be a bug, the shop seemed to restock with the same gear I just bought a couple times  between days).",False

"Metro 2033 Redux is a very immersive game with great pacing that pulls you in and make you fell like your a part of a story that is bigger than yourself.

"The Good
- very good gaemplay and mechanics, occasionally quite original
- good plot
- SUPERB noir atmosphere
- excellent soundtrack
- great voice acting
- great design overall
- good characters

The Bad
- sometimes it's really hard to read faces during interrogations, they just look messy or end up looking the opposite of what they're supposed to look
- occasionally, the voice acting has been poorly planned, and just selecting ""doubt"" will send Cole raging, completely out of the blue and in a totally uncalled for manner, at the poor suspect

The Ugly
- THOSE FUCKING CAR CHASES. FUCKING RAILROADED CAR CHASES WITH THE FLEEING VEHICLE ON IMAGINARY TRACKS, ALWAYS BEING FASTER THAN IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE (NO MATTER IF IT'S A SPORTS CAR OR A GODDAMN LORRY, IT'LL ALWAYS BE FASTER THAN YOU) BECAUSE THE GAME NEEDS IT TO BE, DODGING STUFF AND  TAKING 90° INSTA-TURNS AND JUST BEING UNSTOPPABLE AND UNREACHABLE UNTIL THE GAME WANTS YOU TO END THE CHASE.

I've had a lot of fun playing this game especially since I get to work on cars.,True
An undisputable masterpiece. I'm only sorry I've discovered it too late.,True
"I can't recommend this game at full price, but grab it in a sale.

The good:
- Nice Graphics (UE4)
- story? (it's cool that they add a story in a puzzle game; but not that great)
- the additional rooms are more of a challenge

The Bad:
- The puzzles are easy
- Even though there are 70 'rooms', the game is very short
 
I feel they wanted to create a portal (2) like game, combining the puzzle genre with a story.
however the story falls short, and although I appreciate them trying to create an ethical decision, it falls short, and has been done before.
Similar complaints about the puzzles, they are quite easy, I breezed through them unlike in portal where I actually felt proud of completing a puzzle, and felt like I achieved something. the biggest problem here is that the 'harder' puzzles aren't about thinking it through. I often stepped away not completely sure if that was actually the way to solve the puzzle, or I found a way around the actual puzzle.
The game ran very smoothly apart from a small stutter at the start of every chapter (after loading).
Finally, I got some nausea playing this game.

To conclude, get this game when it is on sale, don't expect difficult puzzles or a great story.
All in all the game just falls short of being good. and feels rather mediocre.",False
"This game was great, could have been much greater. besides the kind of generic item system this was really the best MOBA ive played, the costomization for each characters skills is far greater than any other, and the maps WOW.

This is a pretty good PAC-MAN game. To me its nostalgic and brings the 80s back with variety of levels and different backgrounds.  All achievements; with a total of 12 are all attainable.

"An ideal game for the history fanatics and gamers alike! Set in Renaissance Italia, it proves to show a variation of its maps, unlike the previous installment in the series. Everything from races to assassination contracts is bound to give players endless hours of bloody entertainment!

"Review of the game as a surviver main:

Warning:  If you intend to play *solo* its just a skinner box with a low pay grind that you can't put down.  Also, the devs make horrific bugs and take way to long to fix even the simplest of them.  

Don't get unless you are willing to play with a voice chatting group all the time or you are a hard core top 10% Action/chill-under-stress gamer (in which case you'd be playing the game in an unrealistic way).

Although, the devs absolutely sabotaged the ability to join through discord directly.  So you will have to add them as a friend through steam just to play a few matches with them.  Oh the devs intentionally did this, officially it is so streamers stop getting joined by the random stream sabotagers (which they could stop other ways), but it is probably also to artifically increase the % of friends you have that play DBD.  These greedy devs make way more money than they deserve, seriously.  Also, they have stated they will never make non-humanoid killers, which is not exceptionally hard in modern coding.",False

 Even on easy this game does not give you much of chance and I'm done with it.

I'm a pretty solo player and this is the main reason I bought this game. I find that playing by yourself for the typical player this isn't for you.

If you're a player that just wants to hop in and kill stuff, this isn't for you. 

If you're the type of player that likes to spend time farming and building/researching/crafting and just enjoy the environment, then this game is for you.

I have to praise the design of the playable panties because they are different enough that you can feel their strengths and weaknesses which leads to differing playstyles.

"RUINER é um jogo de ação com uma historia profunda e complexa, gameplay razoavel e NPCS interessantes.
No jogo você controla um personagem cujo nome não é mencionado, e precisa ir do céu ao inferno pra salvar seu irmão.
O gameplay é divertido e extremamente desafiador, se vc quiser jogar isso no hard eu apenas te desejo boa sorte e boa paciencia, pq você vai morrer(pra caralho). o jogo introduz inimigos novos de uma maneira simples e direta, normalmente o primeiro de um tipo novo de inimigos vai dizer algo ao personagem, seguido por um pequeno resumo do tipo de inimigo que ele é. o grafico do jogo é agradavel, em certos momentos fica dificil de enxergar por causa de uma luz forte ou algo do tipo, mas sempre que ha combate, o campo de batalha é facil de ver e entender o que esta acontecendo, os controles são faceis de aprender, e as skills que você aprende são divertidas de usar e ajudam em diferentes situações. a soundtrack desse jogo foi uma parte que me surpreendeu, a musica realmente ajuda a te trazer pra dentro do mundo, e a pensar como o personagem.  a história é foda, n vou spoilar nada aqui, joguem.

"Back when this game came out, it was the perfect example of ""overpromise and underdeliver"". Some might even go as far as to say that the devs deliberately obscured what the game offered, and what it didnt. 
As a day one buyer, I was, understandably,  really mad. But since I was already over the 2 hour refund limit, I didnt bother to contact steam for a special refund. Today, im glad about it. Back in the day, this game wasnt worth 50 bucks, hell, not even 30 Bucks if you ask me. But, and thats the reason Im giving this a positive review:

The devs reacted. Oh boy did they react. Instead of abandoning the game and trying get out of their responsibilities, they decided to weather the storm and restore their good name. In the years since release, No Mans Sky has seen more and bigger content updates than most early access game (Seeing as this was full release, that says a lot) that improve the game in pretty much every aspect. They even brought in Multiplayer (Which will be further enhanced in the beyond update)!

I now see this game as a very good example for business practice in the gaming industry. If you make mistakes and get (deservedly) shitstormed, dont run away. Own up to it, and you might earn dedicated fans that will stay with you for a lifetime. 

It´s what Hello Games did, and now their game is among the best Openworld/Space/Exploration/Survival games out there. I can definately recommend it, although it feels pretty grindy at times - fans of this genre should be more than used to grinding and things like having long travel times etc. though. Concerning these things, NMS is actually pretty arcadey compared to Star Citizen, for example.

"Do I hate this game, not really...do I like this game, not really.
In reality, it's a fun game at times that's flawed with small bugs, server issues, and expansion.
The base game is fun in concept, 5v5 competitive play, great! But with half of the matches come 
some sort of connection issues or weird bugs that completely ruin the experience. 
Pair that with the fact that Ubisoft keeps adding operatives instead of fixing the ones that have been in the game for a year and you get an experience that you want to love so badly but just can't.

"Got this game on Monday November 7th. I love this game so far. it is not for people who like things on easy mode, the game is a bit difficult but not to the point where some people say is impossible.  The game has both good and bad issues. it definitely neeeds some more balancing done on certain things like cost of materials for some items and how much meat you get from animals.  The Game itself looks great and is a  lot of fun as you build up your base...also the idea of the AI actually building itself a base is awesome....kinda cool watching the AI slowly build up a  base. All in All this game has  great future if people would give it a chance and not quit after just 30 minutes of playing. i would  reccommend this to most people but if you dont enjoy a challenge this game really isnt for you.",True
"Have you ever seen a meme of a celebrity and next to them is a look-a-like, but like a less attractive version of them? Well this is the best way to describe Wolcen, the ugly French Look-a-like of Diablo 3. I have played through the whole story until end game and here is what I think about it:

Cons:
The game manages to be creatively offensive in how it steals just about everything from some other place and tries to save face by doing a mish-mash of several things in hopes that you won't notice.
- Level design is a mish-mash of D3, wandering into lower levels of a hell like place? Only to fight a she-demon which turns into Mephisto a la D3 style? Enjoy running through deserts with bugs shooting stuff at you? Or even entering a golden heaven where the powers of darkness are fighting the powers of light? But the blatant copying of Diablo himself is just laughable.
- Story line is rather predictable but what takes you out of the mood is the dialogue. Not that the voice-acting is bad, it's just that the writers are tonally terrible. It tries to have a fantasy/medieval tone to it, but then mixes it with modern snarky comments like ""fine, whatever, i'll play it cool"" type of stuff which just doesn't blend in when Angels are fighting Demons. Oh and you'll never hear ""daughter, brother, father"" as much as in this game ""yes brothers, yes sister, we shall prevail. Like whatever"". Find a tone and stick to it.
- The character design resembles something out of late 1990 Warhammer Chaos Knights. Mega clunky armors which have no functionality and swords that are broad because graphics back in the days couldn't handle detailed animations. It's a creatively odd choice, and not executed very well.
- Bugs bugs bugs, I had to fight the end boss 10 times because of a bug where he froze and I had to restart the whole game to finish him. It's not done yet and I have no major issues with the bugs other that they are slightly annoying and just be aware that the game is far from complete.

Pros.
- What makes this game stand out is the end game. This is where Wolcen brings its own creative ideas into play and without spoiling anything it's design to give you enough incentives to want to continue playing. 

If you enjoy playing D3 you will most likely enjoy playing this watered down version of it. Just know this going in that it's almost offensively bad when you look at the entire game design if you start comparing it to other games. 

So hope you enjoyed this review and feel free to comment on what you think.",False
"One of those games you never think baout playing but you give a try and you get so into that you forget the time and before you know it you have spent hours playing it and still want to play more. I recommend if you havent played you give it a try and if your a person whos played well you know what im talking about. The ability to play the game any way you choose makes it alot more fun because your not limited to a story line and then your done. Theres are hours of things to do that require no quests, theres hunting for food or mining or just plan exploring the worlds. The boss fights are also great fun  becasue they offer mechanics that are unique to each fight. So yeah i have to give this game a 10/10 adn if you play you will understand! :)",True

in my case, in GP14 i create that slide/skid into the corner, but now GP15 bike creates that slide then i crash, lol
i still prefer GP14's physics, but yeah its a good game overall... 

pros :
- better graphics, effects, so on. but color is kind of strange in shadow (assen starting grid), & in the rain
- AA is back but not great, 8x AA the jaggies still present tho
- more detail circuit, but Laser scan circuit on Project Cars & GRID/F1 is more acurate
- wet race is more easier & fun
- tyre wear is more forgiving than gp14 on 5 laps race distance (online race) didn't tried on 10/15laps yet
- trading cards :P

cons :
- its Milestone, we need Codesmaster to takeover MotoGP
- no steamworks
- MotoGP bikes strange corner crash (eg: Brno turn5 right handed, PI turn6 siberia..) Moto2/3 is fine
- weird start > gear one, i just pull the throttle 100% (tcs off), the engine seems to cut the power instead of wheely? the start isnt challenging anymore
- the transmission doesnt feel seamless, just like RIDE's production bike
- crash on wrong place & still got penalty (i dont have any intention to take a shortcut, doh!!!)
- 1.5gb vs 4gb texture, dont notice any diferent

update :
- if u hosting a lobby, randomly freeze during the race still present (since gp13-14), if this happen on the long straight is np, but if in the mid-corner its disaster, ur bike go straight into the wall/speedtrap gravel or high side crash instantly!! (u loose the battle with other rider or even the chance to fight for the victory/podium at least) not happen in every race but can happen 1-2 times in single race... 
- uh uh one more thing, my question just got answered by the recent event (Assen race)
i'd been thinking for a long time if this stuff really happen in the real race, but hey it does!! 
Its kind of failed 'superman' freestyle trick on x-games then stupidly hanging off the side of the bike sooo clumsy & nothing u can do really (need to wobble 1st, but u know what i mean :P).

"It's a simple concept with a fantastic layer of polish. This game throws it back to the days of classic couch co-op and revives it with modern graphics. Overall, it get's a 9/10 from me. 

Pros 

+ Daily Drive will keep things fresh for people who are looking for a new challenge regularly. 
+ Infinity Drive is a huge time sink and gets progressively harder at a steady pace. 
+ Campaign is alright, but it's a Twin-Stick shooter, so campaign is more of an afterthought in my opinion. It could be worse. 
+ Flexible graphics options! This would be a great game to play on a laptop as long as you have a controller. 


Cons 
- No online multiplayer. 
- Dialog is repetitive (Again, twin stick shooter, kind of an afterthought). 


This title is fairly priced for what you get. I would reccomend this game entirely if you're a fan of twin-stick shooters or just looking for a good time, be it by yourself or with friends.

Time required to 100% the main game without a guide: 13-14 hours
Time required to speedrun it: 4-5 hours
Time required to get all the achievements: 30 hours (maybe)

[b]Detailed version[/b]

1- [b]The game's strongest point is its aesthetic[/b], which you will be always be able to appreciate thanks to the multiple ""vistas points"" scattered all around the game map (which is quite vast) and through its dungeons, just to show:

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1159559567

2- [b]The combat, upgrade system and the enemy variety are predictable and unoriginal[/b], meaning that those hidden schematics you will find will contain predictable (sorry for the repetition....uh. The irony.) and not so ""useful-and-game changing-addition""; that the enemy variety is absent and that their combat moves and patterns are easily spotted and understandable at a first glance

3- [b]The game is as repetitive as a old man that does nothing all day and that didn't do anything funny or worthwile in his life besides listening to village/ harbor rumors and gossips[/b]
You will often have to walk in circles (literally, you will even do it at different heights) to press different buttons that will change the world's appearance and the game's stages in order to allow you to get upgrades and hidden/distant game locations. Even if seeing gears and huge cogs moving and grinding can be quite compelling, seeing it for hours might get you bored or less interested in the gameplay.

REAL LIFE ""RANT-ISH"" EXAMPLE:
[u][b]The more i played this game the more i had that same feeling that i had while wooing a girl i liked (unsuccessfully): i kinda (pfff) knew she wouldn't say yes eventually, but i was like: ""well, i've started already, let's see how it pans out"". Ofc i ended up with nothing in my hands (Postitive Mental Attitude at its finest) and lot of wasted time and efforts but i was committed to finish what i started (which...i'm not sure what i even had started and accomplished).[/b][/u]

Shitty and cheesy jokes aside, the more you'll play, the more you'll realize that there's nothing to play for:
a)[u] boss fights are absent.[/u] Period. Even if there's a ""corrupted world"" theme and gigantic dungeons, forget the idea that you'll be facing grotesque or forgotten creatures. The only fearsome creature you'll face today will be this long winded review
b) [u]lore elements are extremely rare and not properly explained[/u]. Even accessing to ""lore areas"" and dungeons will not reveal that much to you.
c) [u]the map is not consistent[/u], meaning that it will show you those collectibles you've missed picking once you'll get enough close to them, but it won't allow you to ""blacken/cross"" them when you've collected them, making the collectibles' hunt less enjoyable. On top of that, dungeons' entrances aren't pointed out on the map and there's no map for underground dungeons
d) even getting all the butteflies, sword pieces etc WILL NOT GIVE YOU ANYTHING WORTHWILE (hence my cheesy rant example). If you want to be really rewarded for your collectible hunting efforts, then play Hollow Knight or Hyper Light Drifter (both reviewed by me, feel free to check and rate my reviews).[b] Getting upgrades won't improve your game experience, it will only allow you to kill enemies more easliy[/b]

TO SUM UP:
Buy this game if you want an average and pleasant platforming gaming experience, if you're looking for a platforming and adventure masterpiece, LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE, as besides Hob's good visual experience, there's not more to recommend here.

"This game has probably one of the most engaging and simple stories. It is very short(2hrs) and can be played in a single sitting even with searching the entire house. This is a story about real people and their daily lives, if you want action or a some sort of puzzle game this is not that kind of game. I can give it a 9/10, there only points I take off from this game is the gameplay length and I wish they could put this on more platforms.",True
"Let me start off by saying that this is a absolutely fantastic game. I’ve found myself to continue coming back to this game after breaks and then playing it hours at a time. It’s a blast with friends and a challenge alone.

The game is a ‘roguelite’. You don’t save inbetween levels and if you die that’s it. There are a number of different classes to choose from and three difficulty levels.  Each class needs to be unlocked (with the exception of the starting class of course) and they all have their own skills and thus change up the gameplay a bit. The game exists out of a number of stages and then the final level. For each stage there are two (if I’m not mistaking) levels, which the game chooses for you. To vary the gameplay there are 100 items that can drop, though most of them need to be unlocked. These items can do things ranging from getting health after kills, increasing your attack speed or creating ghosts of enemies when they die.  As time goes on the game gets more and more difficult so it isn’t a good idea to stay around a level and open every chest you find. There are also unlockable modifiers to change up the gameplay even more but you can find out what they do on your own.

The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic (you can buy it here: [url=http://chrischristodoulou.bandcamp.com/album/risk-of-rain] on Bandcamp [/url]) and the visuals do what they need to. The biggest con of the game is the performance. I’m running an I7 920 and 5870, yet my computer never seems to get 60fps, even with the graphics settings turned down. 

Overall a great experience and you'll get your moneys worth if you like having a bit of a challenge.

"A good sequel uses the original game as a springboard, taking the concepts and ideas and evolving them naturally, taking the good parts and improving on them, and trimming the misused or outright bad aspects down to manageable levels, or removing them entirely if possible. Hotline Miami 2 is not a good sequel.  The core gameplay, that of chaotic violence to the tune of a fantastic soundtrack, is relatively intact. Everything else, however, has changed, in my opinoin, for the worse.

Hotline Miami was not an easy game by any means, but the gameplay revolved around that. It accounted for that. Death was cheap, and respawning was instant, your player character going from a bloody stain on the floor right back to the front door in a second flat, ready to try murdering an entire building one more time. The levels were mostly compact and there were plenty of separated rooms for you to take advantage of, the formula changing slightly as the game went on to add organic challenge and force you to adapt to situations you can't prevent. Due to the game's top down nature, the entire level was not always in frame, especially as the game went on, but you didn't typically have to worry about someone off screen killing you from across the stage because there were rooms between you and them, not one long hallway that you can't see down.

Hotline Miami 2, on the other hand, makes death feel absolutely annoying. Levels are significantly larger, the enemy population growing accordingly. And there's a lot of empty space to traverse. Ordinarily, this wouldn't be too much of a problem, were it not for the greatly emphasized focus on guns. Half of your deaths will absolutely come from off screen because a goon saw you and blasted you from an angle you couldn't account for. You respawn just as fast, of course, but instead of getting right back into the flow without a care, you feel the loss of progress. There's a lot of guys to kill, and if the last ones get the better of you, you are going to feel the pain. The gameplay itself becomes a chore, and the most successful way to get through stages goes against the entire point of the game: taking it slow and steady, holding down the shift key the entire time to make sure the big area you're traversing doesn't have a guy with a gun who'll pop you the second you enter his line of sight. The basic game design has remained the same, while the scale of the actual game has outgrown it and taken things in a different direction that the design wasn't built to handle.

Another factor that Hotline Miami 2 boasts is several different characters. There's actually a ton. And in my opinion, that makes things less compelling. Especially because at least half of them don't even wear masks, and as an effect, don't have special abilities beyond two that specifically come to mind, both with glaring downsides and with no sizeable buff to compensate. One of them is ""nonlethal"", the air quotes being present because you can be lethal, but only with downed enemies. He refuses to use bladed weapons or guns, choosing to unload picked up firearms and make it so enemies can't use them instead of using them himself. It makes sense in character, of course, but adjusting to his gameplay takes time, especially because, again, a lot of enemies use guns. The other character starts with a gun you choose at the beginning of his segments. That gun sticks with you. You can never drop it, only switch to your knife. You can reload it at ammo boxes, but confusingly, he doesn't fully restock, even though the ammo boxes can be used forever. Dropped enemy guns taunt you, because as that character, you cannot pick up any weapons.

The story has expanded accordingly, aiming to expand on how the events of Hotline Miami started, and conclude them. Taking the Pulp Fiction approach of presenting events in anachronic order, the story jumps from character to character at various points in time, not too much of a far cry from how the first game was handled. However, because there is now an overarching story that isn't laid out piece by piece for you to put together, and is instead thrown directly at you, there is dialogue everywhere. Characters talk, and talk, and for some reason, that doesn't feel too ""in the spirt"" of Hotline Miami, the expanded roster making the experience less of an utter mind screw and more of a crime thriller with the chapters all mixed up. Not a bad thing ordinarily, but because it is a direct sequel, it does need to be compared to the original.

Thankfully, the soundtrack remains one of the defining aspects of the game. It was always good in Hotline Miami, and it's thankfully unchanged here. It's one of the unquestionably best parts of the game, and I recommend getting the soundtrack and looking into the various artists that contributed, Perturbator being my personal favorite.

Occasionally there's a level where you get into the groove. You tune out everything but the music, and just jump right in, going right in and playing the game the way it was meant to be played, never stopping, every second punctuated by the death of a pastel suited goon, grabbing his weapon and using it on his buddy in the next instant, the way the game wants you to play it. Unfortunately, those levels seem to be few and far between, most of them throwing guns at you and expecting you to wade in amidst a wall of instant death. Curiously, every character seems to have a degree of resistance to bullets, able to take maybe one or two before dying. However, you won't notice that unless you're lucky. Shotguns kill you instantly, and the ability to take one hit doesn't matter when a thug with an automatic rifle sends several rounds your way. And amidst my major issues, there's a bevy of errors and glitches, the masked twins act as one character, yet the partner AI gets frequently stuck on walls and often fails to give you back up when you storm a room. Some levels have a strangely bright filter thrown over them, which makes your cursor hard to see. On the upside, I haven't seen a single boss encounter or stealth section. That's...about it.

It's strange to see a game functionally unchanged, but feel wholly different. It's a sequel that aims to expand, but does so ungracefully and with surprisingly short sight. At the time of writing (March 21st, 2015), I cannot recommend it at full price. If you must play another Hotline Miami, wait til it's on sale. One of the few redeeming aspects of the game is its cross promotional deal with Payday 2, making Jacket a playable character in that game if you buy the special edition of Hotline Miami 2.

All in all, 5/10. The end result has changed while keeping the basic formula intact, but the game expects you to play it like the first one when doing it in such a way will get you killed more often than not and just lead to frustration. It's a sequel that aims high, but performs worse than its predecessor and falls short of the mark.

Awesome game but not so many levels.,True
"Better than life, pure masterpiece",True
"This game starts off boring if I am gonna be honest. The story is kind of generic and not much really happens. Its not untill the mid point where things start to get off the ground. Zoey and Iris start to express their feelings more and more and you get invested more and more. ALSO, from here on out spoilers!

 I havent played each ending but I did get the together ending. I can safely say that this game isnt for everyone. If you want something like tell tale game where its heavily interactive, or a game in general well look else where. If you are looking for hentai to fap off too then again, look else where, there is one real sex scene after you download an 18+ patch but to be honest, with how invested you get with the characters I would safely say that as long as you play the game with context it wont feel like porn. This game also takes for fucking ever to complete. I spent about 6 hours on it *7 because I got bored with my friends and we skipped to the sex thing before I knew that there was a skip button* and yeah it is an advanced choose your own adenture book. I do however feel fuffilled with my purchase. I got really invested in the character and once I got to the ending I wanted to see it countinued, I wanted to know ""ok now what?"". That being said I felt like the ending was a bit predictable. I kept saying, ""ha, no they wont go down that path, that would just be stupid and predictable."", but then they did. In short, you wake up from a nap to discover your dad has come and basically all your problems go away. Zoey left and Iris blames it on her dad, and then it cuts to years later when Iris sees zoey from far away, chases after her, confronts her, and basically its a happily ever after, of sorts. I feel like that it should have been a dream sequence, where Iris wakes up with Zoey returning, and they have to face the cruel reality of what they have done.   They run away, and in spite of them leaving everything behind, in spite of this being a hard choice they do it. It wouldn't be the happy ending everyone wanted, it wouldnt be a happy go lucky ending, these are two people running away from everything they know, love, and care about to be with someone they know, love, and care about. It would a harsh light on it, making it feel more like a story about taboo love between two sisters and not a happy go lucky romance novel. The other big issue with the game in my opinion was how the only characters we really saw were Iris and Zoey. I dont know if this was intentional but it kind of took things away from me. I know its just a novel in a game but when I see Zoey and Iris and then I am left just to imagine what everyone else looks like I feel like it was just a cheap and lazy method on saving some time/money. It also has an issue of repeating backgrounds, like they use 1 nightclub background 3 times through out the story and then they always are wearing the same clothes, like the school girl outfit I understand but their normal clothes are just the same over and over again, zoey wears a jack with a flannel tied around her waist and Iris wears a cute pink dress.  Lastly, I have to restate this, the opening is so boring. I honestly thought I made a mistake purchasing this at first, because in my mind I basically knew, ok theres gonna be sex, but what the fuck is this shit? Zoey seems like just a fucking punk girl trying to be cool and Iris was just an average marry sue, ok bascially normal anime/hentai bullshit? Then once it got past the first hour or 2 I was like, ok things are getting interesting. And after a while I forgot there was even a sex scene, which ,again, felt more dramatic then it did arousing. I feel like this game is a pretty good book but not really what most people would call a game. 

Overall, I would definetly buy a sequel to this, but I also would probably never replay this game more than once a year, maybe two, if that. Again, this is a book, not a game. The description made that clear. This also isnt hentai/porn, despite what it may seem. This also isn't a happy game, once something happy happens there is something that takes away from it, whethers its an outside source or an internal conflict problem with the character. That also is the reason the ending sucked because where as everything else was a balance of happy then crashing down with something sad or dramatic, the ending was happy, and go lucky. Overall, I give this a recomendation to those who dont mind just reading, but to those seeking a book/porn, look elsewhere.",True

"A fundamental of why Life is Strange scored an inexorable line in the consciousness of many critics this year is that it plays like a video game cultivated by a group of film analysis buffs. It's keenly observant in the way so many modern teenage dramas hinge on the deconstruction of life in the digital age, with overlays of social media dictating cultural attitudes and social politics. With all this flavouring the increasingly personalised choice-influenced nature of adventure games, Life is Strange genuinely feels like a meaningful experience with broadly-drawn characters to care about.

Maxine Caulfield is an eighteen year-old photography student who has returned to her hometown in Portland, Oregon to attend the prestigious Blackwell Academy. Something of an introverted daydreamer, Max's private demeanour belies her gift for images; and it's when she takes an impromptu shot of a butterly in the school restroom the course of her life is altered forever. When Max unwittingly witnesses the murder of a girl later assumed as her former best friend Chloe Price, she manages to willingly rewind time and initiates a change in the turn of events. But that's not the only thing troubling Arcadia Bay: the mysterious disappearance of one of Blackwell's most promising and popular students has been missing for some time, and Max has a vision of an impending tornado which will ultimately destroy the whole town.

What builds over the course of five episodes is a well constructed, believable bond between Max and Chloe with the odd queasy tension of Arcadia Bay's mysteries thrown in. But the real magic of Life is Strange is the incentive to truly immerse yourself in Max's world: episodes are fleshed out moreso by navigating the heroine through every nook and cranny, cross examining all there is to offer on each screen. The attention to detail is impressive and contributes towards subtle character development: for instance, by checking a student's belongings in a dormitory will result in Max being cursed out, allowing her to rewind time while having the foresight of such personal information to broach the topic in conversation instead. It's also taking said incentive to explore the lives of each character which determines one of the most important twists early on in the game -- in a pivotal scene, your dialogue choices influence a potentially crushing event.

Therein lies the novel concept of the game: the ability to rewind time. This means that upon making a story-influenced choice, Max has the opportunity to reverse her decisions and change the outcome. The element also extends to gameplay sequences: Max will sometimes be tasked to completing an item solution puzzle in timely fashion and can use her powers to buy herself more of it; she can rewind time and keep items she has procured. She can also use her rewind powers to latterly revise how she has interacted with her environment. Dontnod's primary focus on time rewind, though, is to enforce how Max dictates her transformational interactions with everyone.

Life is Strange's characterisation subverts high school archetypes and presents a generally strong cast for Max to connect with: for every typical high school menace, misfits and cool kids, there is good writing to provide the zig zags in every straight line, where tired tropes grow into real people. Chloe in particular is a roiling bag of angst and joie-de-vivre, a polar opposite to the more thoughtful and understated Max. It's their relationship that defines the emotional bedrock of the game. A large part of that is the effective voice acting which injects vibrance into every character, so much so you even forget the occasional period of laughably bad dialogue. Graphically, Life is Strange is a picturesque game: tonal shades and hues make all the difference to a scene, and some scenes are shot so creatively it could very well have been straight out of a film. A minor criticism, though, could be directed at the lack of facial emotion during some crucially dramatic scenes.

Yet it's the intense focus on Max and Chloe's bond while unravelling the mysteries of Arcadia Bay that paces the entire story so well. Choices advance the tone and character relationships in each episode, and by the finale the development sees everything turned on its head in a mind-bending, nailbiting conclusion. In fact, there are only a few minor gripes to be had with Life is Strange in general: its occasional experimentation with stealth gameplay sequences fall completely flat, and the sudden shift in genre towards the end of Episode 4 leading into the horror-detour finale feels more gratuitous than effective.

That controvesial finale -- with its troubling connotations, unanswered questions and unfulfulling resolution -- chalks up the experience closer to a flawed masterpiece. But essentially Life is Strange is still a banner title for video games this year. Dontnod faced opposition on two lead heroines bringing commercial success. In many ways Maxine Caulfield and Chloe Price could have been two popular characters on a popular TV teen drama. That we saw their story translate so artfully into video gaming might just be the most inspiring thing we'll see in this medium for years to come.",True

"This game was great.
The gameplay is so similar to The Room that I assumed it was made by the same developers. I've only discovered it's a different team right now, while double-checking before writing the review.

They've done a nearly impeccable job, although I feel they literally have copied all the game mechanics from the aforementioned game, including the xray-like view.
On the bright side, there are few nice new ideas.
The only thing that could be improved a little IMHO is the navigation.

If you like the genre, I can fully recommend it.

"This is a great game and can be very enjoyable.
But it has serious flaws and people should be aware of them.

Level generator is too simple, this leads to sometimes
very easy floors and at other times impossible floors.

Because the game pace is not that fast, the fact that
you might play for a few hours before reaching an
impossible level is a real problem.

A game like this should have saving and level regeneration.

That said it depends on how much you like impossible dungeon games.
Like I said there is no real difficulty progression as you go up floors, its
just easy and then impossible.

Sometimes you will make it to the end, but it feels like pure luck rather than
any decision you ever made.

Despite all these issues I still bought it again on steam, so it still has its charms.",True

Ive played the single player campaign through once and some multiplayer.. im not the sort of person who can easily go back and replay a game.. i just started a second campaign because the gameplay is extremely easy and very engaging. There is an element of rock-paper-scissors trying to outmatch a known enemy unit's type.. but whats brilliant is its not all about that..its all on the strategy.. where you put the squad member.. where is he concentrating his aim.. where do you think they will go.. who is covering the flanks etc. etc..

"[h1] A game about death and imagination. [/h1]

Story: 9/10
The story of What Remains of Edith Finch is one of its strongest elements, it damn better be considering its a walking simulator that costs twenty dollars. Without spoiling any of the best moments of the game, there are many sequences in this game that are breathtaking the witness and there's a lot that can be inferred about the game's central themes through paying close attention to how certain stories play out.

The way the story is told can be confusing to some players, but nothing is ever obscure for the sake of obscurity. The mystery behind the curse is very interesting to unravel as the game progresses and the game makes sure to make it look and sound damn good as well (see later sections for more on that).

My only nitpick with the story is just that some of the sequences don't hit me as hard as others. Stories such as Walter's or Lewis's are amazing while others like Gus's are just alright comparatively.

Characters: 9/10
The brilliance of Edith Finch's characters is that you can get a firm sense of each family member's personality even through the small snippets that you view their lives from. While you can glean a lot from characters like Dawn and Edie, characters like Walter only appear within two sequences, leaving you only a few minutes to get to know them as people. In spite of this, Walter's sequence was one of my favorites. Lewis only receives characterization in the sequence that's focused on him, and his story is my favorite in the game.

Characters like Edie, however, are far more interesting to analyze because while you can discover some of her traits simply through playing the game and seeing what she does, you get the most out of her character by reading between the lines. This is a hallmark of great characterization, where you can infer pieces of a character through their explicit and actions and statements, but only by analyzing the context do you get a fuller picture of these characters.

Gameplay: NA
And so we reach the biggest roadblock to anyone buying this game. It's a walking simulator! Not just any walking simulator, but a two-hour walking simulator that costs 20 dollars. Now let's be fair, that's about as much as going to see a movie with refreshments, and you get to replay Edith Finch indefinitely as opposed to a movie ticket. However, most people play games to... play games. I am not picky, I am willing to shell out money for a good story like this. However, a lot of people *aren't* which is a shame to me.

If there is any gameplay to speak of, it would basically be interacting with objects and triggering dialogue, sometimes you move pages or whatever but its nothing to write home about. Edith Finch is a through and through story, and you're going to have to accept that at face value before buying this game.

Music: 9/10
Edith Finch's music is one of those soundtracks that's not awfully present, but there are certain moments where the music shines wonderfully. I don't know if Walter's, Lewis's or Milton's sequences would've been the same without the beautiful music guiding me along. By using its soundtrack sparingly, Edith Finch is able to heighten emotional moments where necessary without drowning the listener in noise, a trap a lot of movies can fall into.

Visuals: 10/10
My favorite aspect of Edith Finch is its visual presentation, though that is of course in tandem with its story. Edith Finch has a very creative use of subtitles throughout the story, often used to either emphasize actions or to guide the player along the story.

Outside of the subtitles however, the game's visuals are imaginative and beautiful to look at, even during the less interesting stories. Without spoiling anything, visual storytelling is one of the game's most powerful assets. Lewis's story is king of this, but every story is able to subtly clue you in on what's really happening (sometimes not so subtly, but still).

Outside of the stories, however, Edith Finch is able to tell much of its story through the environment. The Finch house itself is a treasure trove of characterization for Edie herself and for each of its former denizens.

Overall: 8/10
But... of course, this is a walking simulator. I wish I could impart my love of art no matter the form nor price on everyone else, but it costs 20 dollars, and that's a steep asking price for many casual gamers. I do think Edith Finch is a good showing, for the record, for these kinds of games. I think its a great game to introduce people to the concept of walking simulators and to get them more open to the concept. However, the initial hump is hard to get over. 

For me personally, twenty dollars to experience this game is a perfectly good pricetag. Then again, I just spent nearly a hundred dollars on Omori merchandise, so perhaps I am not the one to talk about money.",True
"A simple, casual platformer with clean controls, good humor, but little difficulty and some minor level design problems. Although the level design looks like a Metroidvania game, this is more of a mask as there are almost no collectibles and you don't gain any new abilities that change access in the old levels (aside from a generic progression system of ""upgraded drill""). 

PROS:
-Great art / animations
-Soundtrack was amusing 
-Locations were varied and entertaining
-Controls are clean
-3 different ""forms"" throughout the game but controls are consistently good for them all.

NETURALS:
-Ship/Submarine mode was a bit shallow. Mainly just mazes.
-""The Island"" seems pointless. Throughout my playthrough I was awarded $100 1 time. Not sure if I should have checked it more or not but I don't see the point.

CONS:
-Cannot skip dialogue scenes (not that many but still).
-""Missions"" are very poorly designed. Many of them say to ""race to the goal"" but there are no markers or identifiers as to where the goal is!
-VERY easy.
-Although the game looks like a Metroidvania game, it has very few collectibles (1 per game zone, like 8 or 9 total) and the levels simply ""unlock"" as you progress. There is no use of newly found abilities (there are none) to access old areas aside from a ""drill upgrade"" that lets you go through stronger colored rock. Very generic progression in the level design masked as Metroidvania.",True

"Amazing turn-based strategy game with a wide mix of unique units that keep things interesting.  It took me about 40 hours to collect all of the achievements, and I'm still interested in playing more.  For $15 I'd say it's well worth it if you enjoy tactical games.

The first few games I played I got tripped up several times as I learned the ins and outs of the game.  At the same time the gameplay and even the story itself encourage you to learn from your mistakes and come back with better strategies.  Once I figured out how everything works I hobbled my way to victory.

After ""winning"" the game encourages you to try again, but to also achieve different objectives to earn unlock points.  Those points can then be used to unlock different squads.  No only do the different objectives provide fun incentives to play differently, each of the squads consists of units with vary different abilities, but also with a theme.  Each theme requires you play with vastly different strategies, which keeps the gameplay familiar but also non-repetitive.  You can also create custom squads with a mix of units you've unlocked, or have it roll the dice and pick units randomly for an even greater challenge.

The pacing of each game is tuned very well, and there are three levels of difficulty if you want to be kept on your toes.",True

"Great game with lots to do & explore.
It was difficult for me to get in to at first, I even gave up first time round (before H2O update) as everything seemed overly complicated with a lot of ""grinding"" (i.e. collecting of materials). You still do but it's much smoother now and if you put the effort in it can be very rewarding. 
Looking forwards to future updates.

Only real problem that I still have with this game though, is that I always have to return to the fabricator to check up on the materials required to create an item (my memory is terrible). Would be nice to see some kind of tracking tool in the inventory interface that shows what one could already build based on the materials that are currently stored in all the inventories. (Don't get me wrong, some item requirements can already be viewed through the inventory/tools, just not all as there are different building stations). However you can sort of circumvent this by building your own sea bases all over the place with additional storage and fabricators so that they are always close by.

Also another minor gripe of mine but not a negative review: Having to figure out which material to find in order to trigger the fabricator to actually list the item it can create for you. Sometimes you luck out, other times you may find yourself trawling google for answers :-). However, like I said before, very rewarding if you do figure it out by yourself.

On system requirements: I highly recommend this game if you have a decent rig. The scenery (flora and fauna) underwater are simply amazing (above as well, especially for the big celestial body in the sky :O breathtaking). 11/10, for that alone it's almost worth buying this game. See my screenshots or other people's screenshots to get an idea.

Also maybe some suggestions for additional content:
- ""Secret"" quests/story lines (i.e. relics found from an ancient race or journal entries from former crew members) in order to attain special upgrades. Athough this is sort of implemented by scanning certain fragments, there is no real backstory or lore to it.
- A map, although maybe this exists already and I haven't figured out how to do that yet, or there isn't one intentionally.
- Improve the combat system. Currently all I do is flail my knife and hope I hit the target. But I guess that's probably what a human would look like trying to fight a creature in its element :-).

However, all in all like I said, great game and I recommend it!",True

"In terms of its looks, it's an absolute joy to be in this world. Bright, colourful, peaceful and relaxing. The water bears themself are also well animated, cute little things that you naturally want to help out. When they fly around in freedom after a puzzle, joyfully float around you with and shower in the habitats you helped make for them... It's pretty satisfying to solve a puzzle for this reason.

In terms of the puzzles, it's really solid. Super simple concepts that build up very gradually. As thing progress you'll need to plan carefully and actually manage your building materials properly. Alot of the later levels have just enough to make a proper habitat for the water bears. It gets challenging enough towards the end of the main game and theres actually a whole bunch of challenge levels after that. I'm sure they will really test me.

As a VR experience, it's very pleasant and intuitive. You will be moving around the habitat, instinctively, crouchign and wanderign around to locate the water bears and take note of thier needs. Then you of course work out how to improve the habitat to complete the puzzle.

For the price, you really can't go wrong here. I'd recommend it to young, to old and everyone in between, even those people who aren't usually puzzle fans. I feel like this game could make anyone into a puzzle fan. Highly recommended.",True

"This is perhaps one of the greatest COD campaigns of all time.  It is suspenseful, the characters are very dynamic, there are multiple plot twists, and Kevin Spacey is the perfect actor for the role he plays.  

That being said, I recommend this game ONLY for it's amazing campaign and if you do buy it, you should do so if the game is on sale of has dropped below the $60 price.  The multiplayer is fun for about 4 minutes and it is extremely difficult compared to other COD multipayers. 

The Exo-Zombies is mildly entertaining but is not even comparable to Treyarch's Zombies mode. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME JUST FOR EXO ZOMBIES.

The Game has excellent graphics which of course makes it hard to run so dont buy this game if you plan on playing it on your IBM Think Pad from 2004.

The reason I gave this game a thumbs up is for the campaign which is the basis on which most games are judged.  Im aware that the COD franchise is known more for it's multiplayer however in the case of Advanced Warfare, the campaign is the cream of the crop.

I hope this review was somewhat helpful in your decision to or not to buy this COD title",True

"Oxenfree is the weird combination of PG-13 horror tropes, the unfiltered nattering of self-important teens, and walking. It has a story to tell; a tale of lingering death, lost souls and just who’s going to the senior prom with whom. It shouldn't work - it has no real right to work -- and yet, strangely, it does so anyway.

It’s a familiar tale; a group of teens stow away to a near-deserted island to guzzle down beers bought on illegal IDs and create some memories with the friends who'll soon scatter to far-flung colleges to forget just how hard they promised to stay in contact. Only, for Alex, the entire experience is a fair bit weirder than initially expected. She has a new step-brother in tow who she’s only meeting for the first time that day, and her best friend’s reason for going is less about one last adventure with his BFF, and more about creeping on his new crush. The group’s rounded out by the resident socialite whose energy is laser focused on snark and bitchery. 

The island exertion is a tradition of sorts, complete with exaggerated ghost stories and carefully cultivated urban myth. Edwards Island is a creepy place, resplendent in abandonment, decay and disaster. The skeletons of a military base litter the landscape, some buildings left to rot, some half-renovated in a doomed restoration project to make the entire location into a museum. The island has lore; mysterious deaths aplenty to gossip about over a campfire in a heartfelt attempt to terrify your peers on the last night you’ll likely spend together as classmates. Its speciality rumour is that using a radio in certain spots allows you to tune in to weird stations that don’t actually exist. And it just so happens that Alex has a radio. 

That turns out to be a mistake, and Alex tunes into to something she probably shouldn’t have, transforming their once innocent coming-of-age sleep-over into a coming-of-age scramble for survival. There’s suddenly voices to be found in the static or residing a little too comfortably in the group’s heads. People are no longer where they should be, or have stopped being a reliable approximation of the person you remember them as.

I am running  an Unlocked AMD Rana 450 CPU runs as a Phenom II B50 quad at 3.2 Ghz,  have a 1GB 7850 Graphics, on an older Asrock 870 extreem 3 MB, and 8Gb of Gskill Ares 1600 ram in an Antec 300 illusion case.  just to let you know I do not have a bad case.

"I'm gonna say it right now. This is one of the few games that made me cry and felt so good and terrible at the same time.
At first I thought it was gonna be a real short game, hearing that my friend who was watching me play said I was almost done. It wasn't, and my gawd is it a perfect game. The first hour, I probably already made a tear laughing my ass off cause of the hilarious Papyrus and Sans, then at the end.. well let's just say that I was in a call on skype and if it weren't for that and if I was alone in the house, I would've taken my hands off the keyboard and choked up from the feels. This game had a few problems, but mostly I think it was moreso my fault than anything. The only things I have with this game that is actually negative is that I wish the soul could move faster. There were so many times that I felt that I was moving too slow to dodge and I only made this complaint near the END of the game. That and the fight with Undyne was most likely the hardest for me. Out of everyone, she gave me the most trouble, especially when it came to her second trick in her fight. The arrows that come from one side, but are really going to hit you on the opposite side. Some must've not registered and actually hit me before it turned to the other side, as it should. Besides that, there were so many moments that had made me cry, laugh, both and then grow silent, espcially at the end. Having seen what more there was after beating the game the first time, I was glad to know there was even more to the story, especially with one character you meet later in the game. I hope I didn't spoil too much as I want everyone to enjoy this game as much as I did, if not more. I also have to say, if anyone has ever bought the soundtrack, 'Memory' and 'Hopes and Dreams' are my favorite.

TL;DR (note that I have ONLY done pacifist)
Pros
-Great story, especially when you continue after you supposedly won the first time. 
-Lovely characters, especially Papyrus. That skeleton is definitely my favorite skeleton of all.
-Never a dull moment, especially in boss fights. 
-Not too hard nor too easy.
-Sweet and catchy songs (definitely recommend getting the soundtrack.)

Cons
-The previously mentioned fight with Undyne and feeling that I move too slow with my heart.",True

"I don't really understand the hate this game gets. Is it just because it took so long to get to a playable point? After a few hours in game it was clear that the developers are crafting a labor of love. There are enough new and interesting mechanics it brings to the genre to make it a fresh take. The performance is fine for an EA and the game works from what I can tell. They only negative is simply the  lack of players. For the current sales price of $16, the game is well worth it if you're a fan of the genre. It is much more true to the mechanics that DayZ hoped to of had without the gun realism of ARMA. 

In its current state it is much more a PvE game and considering the player count hasn't budged much since release, they should focus harder on this piece of the game.",True

"I'm rewriting this review with an additional 700 hours of time and can safely say I love this game. It's shown me the competitive side of shooters. the strategy and depth that exist in what seemed like the most basic tasks at the time. The community it's the best i'll be honest but I've come to love how you meet people that agree on just enough to be talking but not enough to cooperate. the dumb strategies that somehow work. the dumb fun you can have with random people, on your team or against you. I've come to love every bit of this game. Attempting to put my bias away I can safely say there is no other shooter like Siege period. It has flaws no doubt but damn its perfect in my eyes.

"I cant recommend this game in this state. Yes, it is early access, but yet there does not seem to be put much effort into development. I havent seen that many bugs in a game for years. Some of them are gamebreaking, some could be fixed quite easily and others are just things that have been designed very poorly.

EA, yes - but I dont see a bright future for this game if it develops in such speed and bugs not fixed for months. I lost interest in playing after 30mins, as it is no fun at all. I hopped into it every few months, but not much progress... Save your money.

Game could have filled a gap, as there are not many good police/firefighter etc. simulators out there, but I guess the developers will miss this opportunity.",False

"First of all, please be patient and give this game a chance. You just have to overcome the first chapter, after that the game is getting better and better. Captain Morgane and the Golden Turtle is a classic point and click adventure game. The story isn't that good but still adventurous. The backgrounds and the characters are very beautiful. I played the english version and I gotta say I really liked the dialogues and the voice acting. Especially Morganes spanish accent. There are lots of references to the modern pop culture during the entire game. I had some funny moments. In my opinion, the game is a little too childish sometimes. Be aware of that. I think I don't have to tell anything detailed about the story. It's already written in the game description. 


pros and cons:

pros:
 - beautiful locations/backgrounds
 - cute characters
 - voice acting (Important: This refers to the english version! The german voice acting on the      
   other hand is one of the worst synchronization I've ever heard)
 - low price!
 - funny references to other games, movies and books (Battlestar Galactica, Steve Jobs, so 
   Blonde...)
 - not the best but still an entertaining story (I mean after chapter 1)
    

cons: 
 - tiring beginning (especially chapter 1)
 - rather easy puzzles
 - you have to click left mouse button after each dialogue line to continue the dialogue


After all, Captain Morgane is not such a bad game. If You like point and click adventures, I would recommend it.

I had a lot of fun for a while, despite bugs like the following:
If you launch off a planet a second time in multiplayer without logging off between launches you won't be able to access your digging tool at all. 

Player-made changes to terrain sometimes don't load fast enough and the world just swallows and buries your vehicle and spits you up to the surface. 

Even in single play: if you have two graphine available in attached storage, while scrolling past diamond among the chem lab crafting options, the structure will latch on to the graphine and you will be unable to cancel or change recipe until you use up all available graphine to make diamonds. Make sure you only have 1 graphine at any given time in storage on your chem lab platform unless you actually want diamonds.

"Overall, a fun game. The world is interesting and fun to explore. The main mechanics of the game are driving a boat and scaling the sides of buildings. Interesting use of vertical space in the game. There aren't any dexterity challenges, or any risk of failing, just a world to explore with some goals to keep you exploring and expand your exploration throughout the city. The story is told through unique tribal art, without words. So you get to fill in some details yourself as you go, plenty of extras to explore, or play straight through, only going for the goal of the game if you prefer a shorter experience. Both are worthwhile ways to play. Nicely done game.",True

"*Note to the Developer*
Character development in the last 10 minutes of gameplay is not character development. You're just being lazy as $#!T at that point. I enjoyed a lot of the humor and puzzles, but of the tasks just simply made me not care during certain events (cont...vVv)

[spoiler] I understand that many are quick to forgive Rufus, being that he did the ""ohh but he's finally changed"" trope (people will argue that his character was actually maintained with his ""hope"" never allowing him to give up). I, however, disagree and gave no response to his likely death. It's awful for anyone to die, but be honest with yourselves, that dude had a body count running throughout this series. (I can love him for how awful he was, but just don't tell me to cry at the funeral. He was shit.)

Cletus being the new ""Rufus"" wasn't really anything I enjoyed either, being that his track record was one of self-preservation. Goal had been through enough by the end of the series, however, (1/3) of Goal sucks at being a human being and thankfully her single time of weakness in the series did not lead to anyone being killed (CHAOS IN DEPONIA). Doc was driven to the point of kill or be killed, even if it involved innocent people (GOODBYE DEPONIA). Argus was a twat throughout. I actually think that Bozo is the only decent person we got to know from this series. Also, Toni was another character that really didn't deserve all of the shit she got and her being a bitch stemmed entirely from Rufus wrecking her life on a constant basis. +her body is way better looking than Goal's, wtf was up with that, Germans?

Also, thank goodness for the walkthrough guides, as some of the tasks were so fucked up, I never would have considered them otherwise. I spent forever trying to solve the first game on my own and finally saw how sadistic you would have to be to understand how to put gravy on kids. Funny game, sure, just don't expect for me to weep for any of the protagonists. [/spoiler]

That said, I still enjoyed the series and the characters present it in. Mostly just became curious about any DCL or anything for after finshing the game and came across so many people whining about the ending. I recommend this game for people who can take things with a grain of salt and the ability to play as the most insufferable human being imaginable. I do think, however, the game lacks actual replayability. But for 6$, you should get it and see what it's about. This was my first point and click adventure and I enjoyed it for the most part. It was a random impulse buy done by an RTS/FPS player.

[b] TL;DR, The ending wasn't my cup of tea either, but for reasons other than suffering of acute memory loss. Oh, and it happens to be $6. Good overall, don't expect to fall in love with any of the characters that the game wants you to focus on. $6, buy it. German humor is weird. $6. [/b]


7/10

Oh and P.S.
Do manual saves often. The ""Continue"" feature has a lovely bug that was never fixed which completely breaks your game and you cannot continue (mouse icon will disappear and you can only fix it by A) starting a new file or B) loading a manual save. I was saved from this happening because I always do manual saves anyway. You and your lost 4 hours of progress have been warned. The developer has moved on.",True

"I play only co-op mode. There's no other online co-op shooter that is like this game.

The pace of combat (and its lethality) is in-between Squad and Battlefield. This game is less time consuming than Squad, but more tactical and slow-paced than Battlefield. So I enjoy it because of that. The sound design of this game is the best I've heard in a shooter.

The dev team has released several patches since beta and have worked hard to improve optimization, improve the overall user experience, and to add new content for free. So I trust them based on that experience.

Every gun in the game is available at start; no unlocking anything (which I like). However, certain cosmetic items are initially locked. But they are obtainable by simply playing and winning games, either co-op or versus mode. There is no grinding for them. There's no distracting wallet-grabbing nuisances.",True

The issue I had with the game was the bugs and crashes that were going on during my play.

"In my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a Steam review for every game in my library (#176 out of 555)... it's time for Brutal Legend.

I don't even like heavy metal music, but playing Brutal Legend made me think that I did. This game is... well, it's fantastic. Exceptional art direction, very solid voice acting, but most of all an engaging story, unique and interesting combat, and spot-on humor. This is Double Fine at its very, very best. If you've played Psyconauts and loved it, you'll find that Brutal Legend is just as good in much the same way, even if its premise is about as radically different as possible. It's imaginative as hell, is what I'm saying, and a passionate love letter to an entire genre of music that even non-fans like myself have to respect.

"this game gets a 5/10 on release.  STEAM GIVE US THE MIXED OPTION YOU LAZY FUKS
PROS:
not for casuals
hands-on alchemy
good realistic combat where it's not like skyrim or dynasty warriors, your shield has use.
decent story
historical accuracy is fantastic
effort in putting in info about the time you're in, like who are the rulers and what are the most common jobs
superior RPG than the disasterous dumbed down fallout 4 (take notes bethesda)
towns feel pretty lively.
skippable cutscenes which doesn't intentionally waste your time, like all ubisoft games do so they can prevent you from refunding their games

CONS:
the game is so laggy due to the use of the cryengine that fights became impossible to win, fps in this game is between 13  and 20 even if the graphical settings are the lowest of the low. the cryengine just uses up all of your cpu power for no reason. some people who have powerful PCs than mine complain of lag and crashes. my PC has an i7 2600k, gtx 960, and 12 gigs of ddr3 ram. my experience with cryengine is negative since another game i played that uses this engine called enemy front lagged for no reason. the lag problem with this game is a major problem which is the reason why i gave it a 5/10, the only things i do in this game is craft potions and get rich while i do little swordfights and hunting. why couldn't the devs use unreal engine instead of the awful cryengine?
loading screens are very long, even if it's a basic thing like speaking to someone
the world seems a little empty
there are some bugs and glitches, in my experience in the game, when i was riding my horse, it would sometimes not run when i hold shift, and this one moment, when i killed a cuman and started fighting a bandit, i ended up floating.

"TL;DR
The game was released two months ago; they are still making significant adjustments, but the core mechanics are there and more. If you enjoy twitch-based combat in a co-op setting, Vermintide 2 is one of, if not the best currently available. For $30, most people will get plenty of enjoyment out of the game in its current state. Vermintide 2 is an excellent representation of the genre. 

Around the time Vermintide 2 was released, Vermintide 1 went on sale for 75% off. Having never played Vermintide, I figured this was a good time to try it out, and I convinced three of my friends to buy it as well. None of us knew about the game or had any experience with the Warhammer Fantasy setting. We were certainly not expecting the level of depth the game provides.
Overall, I put about 30 hours into Vermintide 1, regularly playing on Nightmare, before I decided to go ahead and hop over to Vermintide 2. The additional character progression, new monsters, and level design are excellent. If you're someone who enjoys twitch-based combat that requires above-average speed and accuracy, as well as fantastic co-op gameplay, Vermintide is a game you'll want to check out.
As far as graphics, at worst, they're average. I'm probably not the best judge of graphics since up until two months ago I was playing on a seven-year-old system with all video settings set to their lowest/off. Now with current hardware, everything looks great to me.
The audio in Vermintide is incredible. Audio cues for nearby enemies are something that is very important to your survival in the game.
The loot system does seem like somewhat of an afterthought, although it is better than Vermintide 1 in my opinion. Of course, with the game being relatively new, there are bugs. In general, the bugs I've encountered certainly are not game-breaking. However, albeit extremely rare, there are times where you may lose a match due to a bugged enemy or something of the sort. It is worth noting that Fatshark released a 20GB beta patch today that has is focused on bug fixes and performance updates. I have not tested this out yet.
In my opinion, for $30, Vermintide 2 is worth the money. Currently, I have 64 hours in the game, and I could see myself putting in upwards of 800+ In Vermintide, there is always something you can do better. If you're someone that enjoys a challenge and don't mind failing over and over before you finally reach your goal, you'll find a lot of value in Vermintide, especially if a few friends join you.",True

Duke Nukem 3D = Parody of Action movies and games
Shadow Warrior = Parody of Kung Fu and Fighting movies
Blood = Parody of Horror movies and games

That's just putting it simply. If you are a fan of the classic FPS games, then this is a definite MUST-BUY! The only complaint I have is that the game is the original and not a port. There is no multiplayer, and the game tends to glitch out graphically from time to time. Overall, it still brings back good memories and I enjoy playing it!",True

They are constantly adding update DLC's to the game and have incorporated killers from popular horror franchises, as well as some original ones.

Downsides are that competitive ranking does not result in any rewards and that servers are not dedicated, so that killer hosts the server every time.

Community can be toxic, but that's holds true with any large, growing game. I have met many people who were respectful in playing this game.

Buy it.

"It's a weird adventure game that wastes your time with a bunch of mechanically terrible segments and cheap deaths and still only takes you a couple hours to almost fully complete (you will miss bonus stages 6 through 8.  Not even God knows where they are, but it's not like they're fun).  Hastily made; many obvious and easy fixes to glitches are missed.  The few worthwhile moments are early and missable, though pretty funny.  

No steam overlay support.

No configuration options of any kind.  Runs only in fullscreen in what I assume is 1024x720.

Some achievements fail to unlock sometimes because of programmer error.",False

"This game is, simply put, a puzzle maze (not too taxing) underwater, set in a dystopic future where some kind of AI has gone rogue, and all of humanity has been wiped out, I think. It's so depressing down there, it's mesmerizing. Tremendously atmospheric, the sounds are especially creepy. The monsters are not quite as cunning as Alien, but still not the kind of entitites you'd want to invite round for dinner. Basically, it's thought-provoking, as much as it is horrifying.

"This hitman made more sense than the previous ones, maybe that's why I managed to stick with the game to the end. Played all Hitman games but I always ended up deleting after completing around 60% due to the fact that I got bored out of my mind. 

On the other hand, Absolution gave me an interesting story, good dialogues, good gameplay, and I never felt in a small box playing this as other fans suggest. Yet again, this genre was not one of my favourites, and I do not feel so betrayed by the new direction this game took.

"Unlike most reviewers of this game, I don't actually like FlatOut all that much. I'm more lenient towards it now than in the past but it's still not my most cherished racing franchise by far. So when I looked upon all the vitriol of FlatOut 3, I figured I could at least give it a shot since people were complaining how bad it was and I being someone who isn't a big FlatOut fan could bring less skewed perspective to the table.

NOOOOOOPE. This game is as much the car crash as everyone else has already said. FlatOut has problems but none to the degree of this pile.

To start with, the controls are completely busted. In my opinion, you can't rag on a racing game's control right out of the box. You have to take time to understand the nuances of the way the game handles before you can write it off. One of my biggest problems with FlatOut is its handling, which has a very loose and bouncy feel to it that makes it hard to predict what will happen. While troublesome, at least you could make the car do what you wanted if you were patient and meticulous with the controls. That doesn't apply here. Any driving finesse you could hope for is blown out the window thanks to cars that drift like they're on glass. Using the handbrake is an even bigger crapshoot because it spins your car 90 degrees and redirects all the momentum in the direction of the turn, which is completely awkward. In addition, the crappy controls make racing a chore because you can never seem to get a good amount of distance, having to struggle with the terrible controls more than race.

The graphics are bland (like an early Xbox 360 game) and the camera has a weird fish-eye perspective, especially when you kick in the boost, that doesn't feel natural. I get what they were going for but it would have been better just to leave it out. One fresh innovation over previous FlatOut games is the ""Ultimate Move"", which occurs when you fill up a secondary bar. When maxed, you hit the button and time slows down as well as makes your car invincible, being able to plow other cars off the track with only the slightest bump. Neat, but hardly something that makes the awful racing worthwhile. Beyond that FlatOut's signature ""plow into roadside junk and earn boost"" mechanic is still present, which is something I never really cared for in the first place (since, combined with iffy physics, you end up doing yourself a mischief while trying to energize your boost meter by hitting objects the wrong way).

One thing FlatOut has gotten right for me in the past is having a pretty good licensed soundtrack. This game has none. The menu music is just generic and, baffingly, there's no music at all when you race. Why? Part of a good racing game is having fitting music pumping in the background as you speed along. Having NOTHING is dumb as rocks.

Anyway, I didn't get very far because this game is such a junk heap. This is definitely one of the worst racing games I've played, even as someone who thinks FlatOut leaves a fair bit to be desired. I only played this because of the upcoming FlatOut 4: Total Insanity and, frankly, I wish I skipped it.",False

I would place the game in the platforming genre before I would place it within the action genre; so don't expect anything more than an infrequent run-in with foes, instead of the head-on combat style most zombie games are filled with. 

The objective is to avoid confrontation in place of harming the enemy through a series of traps and passages...so it may take getting used to that idea before purchasing the game. Nevertheless, if you are looking for a quick game with a new take on zombie horror you will find it to be a good concept for zombie themed game.

It's unnesecary, the game is already to easy.

You can't compare this game to other dedalc adventures, there you actually have to think or search for items.
You can finish this game in around 80 minutes.
If you could skip cutscenes or the animations when you pick something up or do something, then it would last 5 to 10 minutes.

This is the most exhausting and nightmarish game out there, a real star of death.

Afterwards you try your first community map and the nightmare begins, ALL of them are 99.9~% impossible, the screen flashes in evry colour, the bass/beats are droping in over 180 bpm which does not fit with the rhythm of jumps/clicks you have to makee, the maps are filled with random background thingies which looking like they kill you and lot of actual death traps, trolling gets a complete new meaning in this game.

The soundtracks used by community are so dope, you only gona here your cube dying evry 5 second. And that's why i'll come back again, do get my daily dose of unknown good songs.

At any cost AVOID levels rated as [url= https://youtu.be/mHF-4zh-3JU] Demons+ [/url]. Shoutout to Dorami, you got some godlike skills. And this is just a micro taste of what awaits you.

Combat is really simple.

-So far no cover usage or system at all.
- AI is not blockked by players troops, just walks trough them.

Infinity Ward is back with Modern Warfare 2, the sequel to their critically acclaimed and commercially successful, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. The story continues in this installment as we see the return of familiar faces.

Story: Modern Warfare 2 ups the ante with its story from its predecessor. The campaign follows a special forces unit who is lead by Captain Soap MacTavish (who you got to control in the previous game) and the United States Army Rangers, that are  after Vladimir Makarov. He is the leader of the Russian Ultranationalist party which follows in the footsteps of Imran Zakhaev (who was the antagonist in the first game). The pacing of the story is near perfect. As usual, the first mission involves throwing the player into a training pit where he or she gets to learn about the controls of the game. And from that point on, the game resembles something like a Hollywood blockbuster film. There are loud and bombastic action set-pieces, dialogue which develops each character's personality and above all, memorable scenarios and characters. Sometimes you have to take the stealth approach to missions. Other times, you go loud and guns blazing. This delicate balance of missions is done superbly. All the story missions should take you just over 4 hours to complete.

Graphics: Modern Warfare 2 was released in 2009 and it still looks great today. There is much detail to be found in the textures, characters and environments of the game. While the special effects such as fire, smoke and rain do a great job at immersing the player into the digital battlefields rendered by Infinity Ward. The graphics are used to great effect to accentuate the themes presented by the game, such as hopelessness and peace.

Sound: The sound design is once again, done fantastically by the programmers at Infinity Ward. Each gun when used, sounds impactful as bullets pierce through the air. You can hear the thunderous roar of cannons as they are blasted into the enemy. Likewise, the voice actors have done a tremendous job in bringing life to their characters. Ghost is one of my favourite characters as his cynical and cool demeanour is complemented by his country British accent. Every emotion exhibited by the characters, whether it be happiness or sadness is exemplified by the excellent voice acting and is feels authentic to listen to.

Gameplay: The same fast-paced and addictive gameplay of COD 4, returns in Modern Warfare 2 with some slight adjustments. No longer can you lean left and right to sneak a peek at enemies and shoot safely. I believe this is decision was for the best to discourage camping and to push for gameplay that is faster and even more frantic. Additionally, when you are shot, not only is there a red arrow which tells you the direction of the shot but also an additional splattered blood effect which appears on screen. As you keep receiving shots, more and more blood appears on the screen and I think this is a cool feature to let you know to take cover. Again, like COD 4 it feels very satisfying to land a kill in the game as the controls as smooth and snappy.

Overall, Modern Warfare 2 has been the sequel I had hoped for. Everything that was in COD 4 is cranked up to the nth degree with graphics, gameplay and even story improvement. There is also an additional Spec Ops mode which lets you team up with a buddy online to tackle special missions designed around environments found in the campaign. This is the near perfect FPS and is a must-play.

"First of all I would like to say, if you ever see this game on sale, pick it up, no question.

Among the sleep is one of those games, comparable to journey, where the actual gameplay tends to step aside for the atmosphere and the meaning of the game. Though this game is a ""horror"" game, it dosen't feel too much like one, mostly puzzles and an errie enviroment to boot. On top of that the game is quite easy, you could probably go through it without dying once (which I could say on your first playthrough would be quite hard to do, as juding what places you are and aren't allowed to drop to are a bit odd). 

Mostly what you'll be doing in this is solving several easy puzzles and once in a while hiding from a monster that only appears in a few parts of the game, which I would have to say is my biggest complaint. Many people talk about the length of the game, but to me, the game felt as long as it needed to be (besides the kinda abrupt ending that felt like it was a tad lazy). One thing I will say though, is keeping in mind that the game is easy, you should explore the levels, look at the drawings. The levels have all these extra areas to explore, not to artificially add to the length, but to discover and add to the game. 

Overall the game is great, if you see it on a sale, pick it up no question. If you are looking for a game that is going to hit your feels and stick with you for a while after, and don't mind the $20 USD price tag, this might be what you're looking for.",True

"The FAll does many things great! Atmoshpere, Ambient Soundtrack, Sound Effects, Voice Acting, Script, and even the gameplay, which while not intuitive to the player, is unique enough to warrant more development and deserves our engagement.

With quite the story to surround itself with, with sci-fi elements worthy of Philip K. Dick and Isaac Asimov concerning artificial intelligence, and great scripting to go along with it, I found myself very engaged with the story despite the extremely short playtime it gave me. Steam says 3hrs of game time, and  say that's about a fair assessment (with a few hours of downtime to mull a puzzle over or play other games).

For a starting title, the developer really put a lot of heart and soul into this, hope it continues in a much lengthier The Fall Part 2.

I highly recommend it for any wanting something fresh and beatiful despite the short length. The price shouldn't be an issue, especially if you want to support someone who knows how to make something imaginative and lovely.",True

It can be tedious, but in the most cathartic way possible; I don't feel particularly excited when my dynasty purchases a new title - it's more of a zen sensation.

When I first saw videos clips of this game I have to admit I was not impressed enough to want to buy it.  But it took a few more videos to convince me to make the purchase.  This is my favorite game currently.  I’ve been a fan of first-person shooter zombie games since COD:WaW introduced us to the Nazi Zombie mode.  This game not only offers that experience but blends it with the survival-crafting-destruction of Minecraft.  And the settings in-game let you customize your experience to your liking (I’m not a fan of zombies that run in the Olympics!).  I would recommend this to any avid gamer.  Can’t wait to see what the devs do with this title!,True

"After playing this game for over a thousand hours, I can say I would have bought this game for $40. I paid $15. It's $10 now, which is more then a fair price: It's a bargain.

After playing this long I still suck at building XD The workshop is filled with endless craziness, and there are LOTS of servers, you'll never have an issue finding a server. Download time for an average prophunt or sandbox server is 5-15 minutes for me. 

THE ONLY NEGATIVE

Garry's Mod is FILLED with whiny kids, people looking to blow your eardrums, and abusive admins. If you play this game you WILL encounter all of this. My least favorite is abusive admins, who jail you for silly things, like ""my store sign sticking out to far"" or, sometimes, even for no reason. I've been jailed for ""Being a fag"" a multitude of times for doing nothing at all. But aside from this negativity you will encounter, I've made quite a few friends in this game, and found a couple amazing ""communities"" - Meaning everyone is chill, helpful, and know each other.

"Two months later...

I haven't really been able to find the game very engrossing. I usually can only stay entertained by it for about 20 minutes before bordedom sets in. Without a sense of accomplishment the game feels endlessly pointless. I have no interest in online multiplayer which might help others enjoy it...

In two months 16 hours of gameplay is pretty sad for something that seemed so promising. It's close, but it's just severely missing a ""fun"" factor.

The random levels makes finding power ups a chore, and as another reviewer said ""a death trap."" As there may or may not be anything there or a way to get back.

The bosses are lame at best, just glorified level creeps. With the level challange to beating them being the level, itself, becoming more difficult as they get harder. With no story it's hard to find a reason to care about fighting them. They repeat constantly, I think there are maybe 4-5 bosses? All garbage, all lacking a sense of accomplishment.

The developers have added very trollish items to ruin your runs, like one that removes almost all of your health and another that removes your ability to use specials. The items don't say what they do instead having some cryptic description. Think finally making if further than you have only to pickup an item that gaurantees your death. It's just not fun.

In mega man, you would get more poweful as you got ""upgrdes"" in this it's not always the case and I personally hate it.

I really dislike the in level shops as they almost never have worthwhile items or perhaps there just are no worthwhile items.

I'm going to actually uninstall now because at this point it's becoming clearer and clearer to me I just want to play mega man x and that this game won't ever give me the real satisfaction due to its rogue like elements the developers seem to insist on. 

Random level generation is garbage and I feel an excuse to not have good level design, this isn't Terraria. Also there are only 3-4 really different feeling levels the rest is petty much just copy/paste with a few different textures.

If you like mega man games, I'd say pass. It'll feel good at first but after a little bit be prepared to be underwhelmed and sad at having something so close be so far off.",False
"As a huge fan of Xcom reboot it saddens me to say that this game is hugely dissapointing. To draw a parallel this is Dark Souls 2 of the Xcom series. Whole game feels rushed and unfinished: game breaking bugs, imbalanced difficulty (I've finished og game and expansion on Impossible/Ironman but here Legend feels deliberately unjust), lack of the half of original game's features, like shooting down UFO, there's basically a few different mission types, that feel lacking in scale (compare this on a ship assaults in the first game) and a really rushed ending. Story is shlocky, which isn't bad for this type of game, but it made my eyes roll, 'cause of the stupid cliffhanger ending.  To conclude - you're better off with an original game + Enemy Within, it's far more diverse and complete game, or wait for bugs to be fixed and game be balanced better.

P.S. Shout out to all the game reviewers that forgot to mention all of the things I stated above, you really do your job well.

You'll find yourself spending hours at a time exploring pleasant looking lands with fierce beasts you can't beat yet. Then, more hours will be spent grinding out the materials and skills to make a set of gear to get you a wee bit farther. Maybe you'll find friends to help you along the way or make many enemies finding your own stubborn way.

The combat system is quite engaging and feels very responsive. From the magic side of things I can say that combat is more fun than in games like Elder Scrolls Online, while maintaining the same level of mobility and that exciting pace. It was apparently built from the ground up and is worth mentioning.

If you find yourself without an MMO and favor that old grind in a new way then Gran Skrea Online may be a sanctuary for you too.",True

"This game is a piece of crap. 

The graphics go from acceptable to suddenly looking like a PS2 port, at times it actually looks like an old Resident Evil game with how muddy the textures can look. The user interface is ugly, dated looking and even looks low resolution at times (noticeably on the type) and has terrible key mapping.

The gameplay is actually boring because it's not very difficult, in fact at times it just gets you plain angry when the QTE moments fuck you over and other similar dick moves. This isn't the Resident Evil I remember playing years ago, it's just a generic and sloppy action game. If you want a good third person action game play Max Payne instead.

"Paris is increadible, gameplay is better than previous Assassin's Creed games too. Honestly, you know what kind of game you're getting with Assassin's creed and this is just like previous one's: good art and stabby stabby without shitty follow missions and a plot that is half decent.

I say only half decent because there is two stories being told, one a revenge/romance, the other the assassin's vs. templars. Guess which one drags the game down (it's the templar half of the story). I honestly would have been so much happier if I did not have to listent to bad guys prattle on about their awesome society after I killed them. \

The giant elephant in the room for this game is the performance and I'll be honest about it. It's not great, if you have below a 680 graphics card, do not buy this game. But I have a 780 and an ultrawide monitor and was able to run it at 30-60fps consitently. I will also say there is a reason for the bad frame rate, it is because the graphics are really, really good.

"Story - 5/5
Characters - 5/5
Gameplay - 4/5
World - 5/5
Atmosphere - 5/5

Needs widescreed fix and sound workaround (see community guides).

Simple game from simpler times. Or is it? 

- The story is quite simple yet engaging. There is no politics, moralising or propaganda. It is a bed time story about a prince and a princess... who kill a lot of monsters. You play a prince, who wants only to gain glory, honour and win his father's trust. He is tricked by evil vizier to open a mythical sands of time in promise of that, but it actually turns everyone in the city into monsters. Everyone except the prince, vizier and the sexy captive princess Farah, who will accompany you and help you fight through the palace to get to the vizier, close the sands of time and hopefully return everything to the way it was. And naturally, being a man and woman, some feelings start to occur. The characters are very well written, especially prince, who truly acts as a member of royalty. He is proud, cocky and thinks he's above everyone else and his monologues with himself, as he tries to figure out his relationship with Farah, are just brilliant.

- Gameplay aged well. It is fluent and responsive most of the times (the camera act weird from time to time) but what is more important it looks really cool as prince runs on the walls, even verticaly, and does a salto everytime he can. Puzzles, that occure from time to time are interesting and do not slow the game too much.
- World is pretty and most of the areas feel unique. A lot of work has been put to details on the enviroment and even the characters. The animation of clothes and hair are close to modern technology.

Pistol Round
I walk around a corner and see someone halfway across the map. I fire a few shots at the dude with my usp-s and hit him twice. He pulls out a glock-18 and one taps me in the head first shot. Meanwhile my friends are getting deagle rushed and get dominated.

A Few Rounds Later
Me and a friend are walking down a hallway and a dude pops out of nowhere and unloads an entire clip on us. My friend gets clapped while I quickly hide behind a box for cover. I got hit a few times but luckily I bought a helmet and arm-    11HP  99ARMOR    As I'm confused of why my armor hardly did anything, the dude lobs a grenade at me and claps me. Meanwhile my team mates die somehow.

Last Round
It's down to me and someone else. If I win this round, me and my friends could clutch the game and win. I'm defending the planted bomb and holding down an angle with an awp. The dude walks around the corner, I take a shot, and the dude fricking vanishes like Goku and appears right in front of me. His arm starts to extend and coils around my body and prevents me from moving like a giant snake. I try to scream, but with his other hand he puts a finger on my mouth and silently calms me. He leans in and whispers in my ear ""Don't worry, it will be all over soon."" and gives me a soft kiss on the cheek while he leans away from me. The hand from the arm that is coiled around, has a deagle and points it at my head. He shoots the gun, and the last thing I hear is....       COUNTER-TERRORIST WIN.

"The game is really fun and good in it's core. But the engine is trash. It didn't work with the cancelled Halo game, and it doesn't work Quake Champions.

Optimization patches leads to increased frequency of spikes and fps drops that were previously not there. Playing a match with 8 players is in the current patch a fucking nightmare. I love the game, but it's making me angry and I find myself not having fun and just playing it because I love the core of it and hope that there is something to do with the engine (Thomas the train?). Also, the sound is...bad, when the engine actually produces the sound, which it often doesn't.

I am not recommending the game because it's in a terrible state. I don't recommend friends to try it out, and I've stopped asking friends (that normally don't play Quake) to play.

"A lot of people slating the game for ""griefing"" or ""backstabbing."" The whole point of this game is that it is totally open. You can do *anything* in Eve. You can: 
become a mining magnate and supply materials to others; 
run a multi-billion ISK (in-game currency) manufacturing conglomorate, building ships and station parts; 
be a pirate king and take everything from those weaker than you; 
run a mercenary gang protecting traders from pirate attack; 
be a trader, making money shipping the produce made by the hard work of others; 
enter into espionage and intrigue turn the tide of battle with months of meticulous planning and ruthlessness;

100HRS rocket to the moon the very first time :P,True
"A good game, but not without its flaws. The controls and mechanics are simple, but the antagonists in the levels are varied and well done.

The main complaints in the negative reviews are:
1) ""The controls are too floaty."" They are floaty, but I didn't have a problem after a few minutes of playing, so I chalk this up to taste.
2) ""You have to click David to shoot, it's difficult/uncomfortable/unintuitive."" Only once in my playthrough did I have an issue with clicking on David, and that's on the level in which the camera zooms out the most. I don't see why this is a problem.

As a preface for my negatives, the game has two difficulties: the easy difficulty has something like 8 lives per level. The hard one has only 1 life, and there are some level differences as well (I think). I played the whole game on the harder without knowing the difference, and many of my complains are due to this. My complaints:
1) The game spends too much time at the beginning of a level and when you die. Since you could easily die within a few seconds, it's annoying to have the game bring up the game over screen as slowly as it does. Further, upon starting a level (for the first time or restart), the camera spends far too long lingering on the enemy or some objective while the gameplay continues, so you sometimes have to move before the camera is on you or you die.
2) The slowdown when charging is too strong, and limits your view. When you charge to shoot, it slows the game time, which in turn changes the level of zoom on your character; it can be disconcerting. Unfortunately, the time slowdown is necessary, but zooming in while charging makes it easy to lose track of enemies that you should be able to see as well as have you misjudge momentum.

Despite those annoyances, I kept coming back to it and beat it, spent some time in the arena, some other things. It's not incredibly replayable but well worth the value, especially now that the price has dropped.",True

Some key things that would make new life easier for players - Blood web is way too much a a grind for anyone starting new. 1 perk requires 3 different upgrades in the blood web which requires in game points to unlock.

Cross play.. the game is not matchmaking correctly at all and if by chance it does its assigning players way higher ranks then they should have. No one does objectives or thinks objectives are farming players off hooks.

"Okay I know this might sound kinda mean, but I took great personal satisfaction in killing Horace in smouldering lake. The dude is a giant ♥♥♥♥ing cockblock.

Remember meeting him at the road of sacrifices? I just wanted to cozy up to Anri (that husky smooth voice rising up out of her buxom set of armor really gets me goin) but there he is: Mr. Big-silent-melee-man staring me down - too good to talk to me, but not good enough to walk away so I can gank Anri into the soft leaves and cuddle up with her among the warm embers of the bonfire.

God what a ♥♥♥♥ing boner. Just standing there, all high and mighty, not saying a word. I would have strong-attacked him right there if Anri wasn't watching. I'm a man with some class, so I know she wouldn't be quite as down for some gentle-but-firm backstabbery with her friendzoned GBF's corpse a foot away.

When I ran into her in the catacombs I played the part of the kind consoling lover: ""Don't you worry a bit,"" I said. ""I'll find Hoary for you. I'm sure his mute ♥♥♥ just got lost.""

I found him, alright. Hollowed in the smouldering lake - makes sense, honestly. That area sucks, and he couldn't handle it. He's a cocky noob- the kind of guy to beat a boss and then lose all his new souls to some chump enemy one level later.

So I put him down. I whipped out my astora greatsword and pounded his ♥♥♥♥♥-♥♥♥ into the lava floor. And I liked it.

If I didn't do it, some giant crab would have. At least I did him the honor of dying to a true champion. It was more than he deserved.

""I'm soo sorry Anri, but I couldn't find him! I left no illusory wall untapped. I know you're sad Anri. Maybe this will help you to feel better!""

"I am right on the knife's edge about this game.

I wanted to love it.  Certainly there are a lot of things to love.  The theme, the score, the spookiness, the way it made me look up when walking down the hallway at work.  The fact that it was so absorbing that when my cell phone rang, I literally jumped.  Amanda Ripley was great.  She was the reason I kept playing.  I needed to know what happened to her.

The problem is the parts that I hated.  First, do NOT get this game unless you at least tolerate stealth games.  And if you only tolerate them it's a near thing.  I almost stopped playing in chapters 5, 6, 11, and 14.

Be prepared to spend tens of minutes cowering in closets while the alien literally walks around the perimeter of the room in front of you over and over again.  

You can only save at certain physical points, so be prepared to spend 20 minutes sneaking and closet hopping only to die in the last stretch where you have to cross open ground, over and over, even on the easiest setting.  I started on the normal setting, and moved it down as frustration overcame me.

Be prepared to be killed by the alien from behind when you've got your back into a corner, or when you can literally see it in front of you.

I like games where if I do things right, I can get through after maybe 3, 4, 5 tries.  This was not that game.   I am not great at stealth, but this was something else.  The alien would randomly kill me in closets even when I was holding down the two buttons for extra hiding.

In the end, the frustration outweighed the joys.",False

"Unpopular opinion but I prefer the reboot ""DMC"" way over this. Its very obvious this game was made for fans of the originals and if that's what your looking for then you will probably have a good time with it. For me the repetitive level designs ( I swear 75% of this game takes place in Satans asshole ) The multiple playable characters which all,  ( except for V who is on borderline auto pilot ) have basically a full on manual of different move sets and quirks that you have to memorize like your studying for a ****in entrance exam just made the combat way to overly complex and I really would have just preferred one main character to learn instead of 3 or should I say 2.5. On the plus side the monster and character design are all top notch and that RE engine still blows me away with its face and motion capture but I wanted to play a game, not watch a movie so I'd have to say I'd give this game a pass.",False
its a great game,True
"From the outset this game probably had the best atmosphere and is probably the scariest out of all of them. Gameplay is challenging like always to keep you on the edge of your seat. I love how the story is built up through the nights until you reach night 5 and finally get the fnaf answers you've been looking for. Some elements are rinse and repeat and after a while you learn the jump scares which overtime makes it less and less scary. Still, an epic conculsion to the fnaf series, a great game, thank you scott for making an excellent series.

"Actually a well-crafted puzzle game. It starts out with fairly simplistic logic puzzles that don't require much effort to figure out, but quickly evolve in to more and more challenging pieces.

I feel like the mid-game was the most difficult, as there was a lot of ambiguity in location and what you're trying to accomplish. By the end-game, your attention was funneled in to one area, and it was a lot more satisfying to get through a roadblock. 

I've heard there are elements in the game that are randomized (Solutions to puzzles), and this is a nice touch but it doesn't have replay-ability to me unless you are going after the 'other' ending (Assuming you didn't make a save file just before the end), and some hidden secret achievements.",True

+ No need to play it with High-end or Mid-end PC. ( I played it with Laptop AMD A8 - Radeon R5 ).

+ Has much event related to each character.
- Quite boring battle with monters ( They just change color of monster body to make it difference ).
- Some map or dungeon feeling empty even its big, I think they can do better than this.

"Utterly false advertisement.

This game describes itself as an airport management simulator. Back in the day, I played Airport Inc/Tycoon - a game where you built your own terminals and areas within them, runways, and competed for aircraft contracts etc etc. From the description, I could only assume that this game was like that, but with modern graphics and (hopefully) better gameplay.

How wrong I was. This game is mediocre on every level compared to the 14 year old game I previously played - and that wasn't brilliant.

How anyone can develop a game and think it will be fun to drive poorly animated, poorly controlled airport vehicles to and from a plane at incredibly slow speeds is something I have yet to figure out.

I have played 41 minutes of this game and hoped I was missing something. Perhaps after I had done all this to one plane, I would be able to move on with the 'detailed and comprehensive simulation' - no! Another plane arrives and repeat, you must...

Please save yourself the money and don't buy this game. I now need to try to get my money back for flagrant false advertisement.

All you do is collect a few resources, make your way to a waypoint, collect a special resource, use it to make an upgraded space suit, then make your way to a second waypoint, and voila, the game is finished.

"A lot of people say co-op is the way to play this game, but I've been having a lot of fun with it solo.  It's very deep and engaging, and once you've put some time into it it'll get its ""one more run"" hooks into you deep.  The problem is it doesn't put its best foot forward and it doesn't really teach you what to look for.  The starting class, the Commando, is straight forward but his dodge ability takes a lot of time to really master.  The second class, the Enforcer, is great for multiplayer but a little too slow and plodding for solo.  I've found that the most interesting classes unlock through random event spawns in the later levels, but they're either out of the way or blend with the rest of the scenery so that you need to be right on top of them to get the button prompt and realize they're actually gameplay elements.  

If you want to have fun solo with this game, my recommendation is that you set it to easy, unlock all of the classes, and then play it on normal.",True

"I absolutely am loving this game. I know it's a work in progress and there's a few bugs and things but I trust these will be sorted eventually (e.g. the guest feedback constantly says there is too much trash in the zoo even if you've got like a hundred bins and 20 janitors lol). Thank you for making this awesome game. It reminds me of how I felt playing Zoo Tycoon for the first time back in the day. There is something quite new and refreshing about it at the same time. I love the art style and the ability to just freeform construction and make your park look however you want. I'm excited and looking forward to seeing what the developers have to offer. I hope there will be a sandbox mode where everything is unlocked and you can just mess around with everything for fun. Campaigns and more challenges would also be really cool.

Edit: I am back here 7 months later to say thank you devs for continuing work on this game, and thank you for listening to feedback. I have really enjoyed the campaign levels you have made so far, and many of the bugs I experienced previously have been fixed. Great job!",True

"don't get me wrong before i go on with my review for this game, terraria was a ball of fun and starbound has put together a great concept in taking the terraria idea to next level of side scroller sandbox survival. There are just a few issues that should be addressed before starbound progresses from the beta stage. While I have only played the game for under an hour the issues that i encountered during that time were some basic errors that appeared. For a starter the loading times to get into the game were tedious and took so long before i even hit the main menu. a issue to address as well would be that perhaps to include a tutorial mode opitional in the main menu (idea that terraria featured in their game), I felt in my first 10 mins of actual gameplay that i spent trying to complete quests that were set and i had no idea of controls of features within gameplay. This included the screen being hugely focused and up close on my character and i could not find what were the controls to zoom out so i may have a wider view of the environment around me. I am sure that some other people have encountered similar and different problems but there were some of the key ones that i experienced during my gameplay, still being in its beta stage I would recommend this game if u a huge fan of terraria. If developers and the crew who worked on the starbound title take public views as constructive critism than they address key issues in futures upgrades and possibly if all things work out great in the end, it could be a game that tops terraria standards.",True
"Like everyone says, this game is a lot like a dark Stardew Valley. Critics call it grindy, and it definitely is, but that tapers off as you progress in the game and start automating things with the help of *ahem* *SPOILERS* zombies. 

Stardew also has season and weather restrictions to things, which means if you miss your window to do something, you have to play a LOT more to get another chance (the main thing that kept me from 100%ing it). Graveyard has a similar mechanic but it's more like ""days of the week"" where each day has a different NPC that only appears on that day, so if you miss your window, it's not the end of the world. You just keep chugging along on some other task.

The stamina bar is tiny so in the beginning you end up making only a little bit of progress and then sleeping, but food solves this. My go-to is honey. There are some beehive trees not too far from home and pretty soon you can build your own hives that produce way more honey and can be harvested more often. So now that I have my honey farm going, I stay up multiple days doing things (and some exhaustion symbol appears? if nothing else, a reminder to sleep and save my progress).

Frustrations: 
* There are 3 different colors of XP gems, and they seem really imbalanced in terms of how you get them. They are required to unlock things in the tech tree, and I definitely got to a point in the game where I couldn't figure out how to get more of the purple/blue ones because I needed them to unlock the next obvious ""how to get more"". I really had to hunt around to figure out the route forward, and some kind of in-game guide would help this immensely (not just hunting around on an external wiki). I literally had to run my guy around the map to look at recipes at the craft tables; it should be an on-hover infocard in the tech tree showing materials to craft (along with whether or not those materials had been unlocked yet) and what color XP gems you get from crafting and/or studying it. 
* The tech trees are pretty ""choose your own adventure"" but there are dependencies that are not obvious until you get stuck. This is related to the ""how to get purple?"" frustration above. I spent a long time last night running around between different parts of the map looking at available recipes on different craft tables that required crafting something at the *other* craft table in order to unlock the next thing, but wait, I need to unlock this *other* tech tree thing to unlock *that* craft item to build that *other* thing that is preventing me from progressing. This is more wishing for a better dependency UI in game. Maybe recommendations for what order to unlock the tech in, like ""don't bother unlocking this tech because that thing you unlock requires this other tech that you are not even close to unlocking yet, so save your purples!""
* Money is slow to come by, and it seems to gate early game tasks. I think they are meant to take a long time to complete, and eventually (like in Stardew) I'll be making plenty of money, but it starts off very difficult to make money, especially given how expensive many things are to buy. Certain quests have multiple ways to complete, one of which involves spending lots of money to buy the items, and the other involves playing the game in a stingy way until you get them for free much later. The problem is if you don't know the free way, you end up spending all your money on these tasks and slowing down the money accumulation required for money-only progressions. 
* Certain should-be-farmable items cannot be farmed and can only be purchased. This feels lazy on the developers' part. Like I can grow apple trees but I can't raise chickens or cows for eggs/feathers and milk?? This factors in to the money squeeze frustration. I thought, ""maybe this comes later"" but the wiki concludes that no, these items can only be purchased :|
* I wish I could move things around, not just remove them (which does not return all materials) and build them over again. I'd be willing to spend energy and maybe a small amount of materials to rearrange crafting tables. 

Why I'm addicted: I'm a completionist and I want to unlock all tech and get all the achievements. Despite frustrations with UI and certain balance decisions by the developers, I'm enjoying it more than I'm frustrated. This game is a good one to play for hours while watching tv.

"Pros:
- Fun fighting mechanics
- Quite a bit of content
- The character models are very well modelled in the sense of quality, not realism of course
- Animations are extremely impressive for a game at this level
- Quality in general exceeds what a game of this level should

Cons:
- Despite it being fun fighting mechanics, nothing else to the game really exists. If you aren't a hack and slash fan, it's not for you
- Content while alot, aren't necessarily long missions. Just alot. The game does have alot of extras though. Also a ridiculous amount of costumes and cosmetic options
- While animation is great. The thing this game did wrong with it becomes extremely apparent in the completion of a mission. The game wasn't made with a flowing animated character. But with 60 animated stills for a characters animations per second. So when playing at 60 frames per second and you finish a fight that's not a fight against another main character. The characters move in slow motion and you start getting the character moving at come really choppy low framerate while the rest of the game is running 60fps. It's pretty bad and catches my eye every single time. 

Technicals to note: (technicals aren't the same as flaws to me personally so i separate them
- If you use Ultra wide like 21:9 or more. You have to play borderless to get your proper 1080p.1440p etc without stretching. That being noted, no it doesn't natively support ultrawide resolutions and I don't edit code so I don't know how well it would work with a modification.
- 4K in screens lower than 4K definitely needs a mod, it doesn't max at screen size sadly
- While a quit game option always being available is a plus to me. I think having a quit game option right at the bottom of every menu's bad. I've accidentally quit the game entirely because of this multiple times. 
- Like every game some flaws exist. For me the one to note that I've seen is during Shinobi transformations, the game may glitch and the clothes never come off during the animation, but the censor lights come while clothes are still on. Looke weird but the scene where the clothes start appearing, the clothes will be completely on right at the beginning of the scene. Ultimately defeating the purpose of watching it. But I skip it so Generally I don't have any in game issues apart from that. 

Final pieces
- Intimacy mode is in this. It literally isn't anything I care for. Did the one achievement and really shook my head the whole time. It's a pointless mode that's pretty disturbing to me personally.
- To the ones that may want to do this for some reason. Turning off damaged clothes in the story in the menu doesn't do what you may think. As I have family that walks in the room randomly. I don't care if they see the game. But I prefer to cut back a bit so I expected it to just have during the scenes, undamaged clothes. They'll be wearing the full costumes even after being stripped naked unlike Estival. But what it does, which is surprising to me. It completely removes  the ability to damage clothes and strip characters naked. I like it as I don't really care whether or not the characters are stripped. I skip the scene to continue playing if possible so it's stopping the break sequence for main characters. The minions still strip to underwear though

Games a yes if you like hack and slash. Or you just bought for lust purposes. No judgement here. But if that's the case, this is heavily toned down as opposed to Estival",True

"I had an equal mix of fun and frustration until I beat the game. Beating the game took me about 20 attempts, and 4 hours of gameplay. After beating the game it felt pointless to replay.  I didn't feel like I got my money's worth.

Binding of Isaac gets a lot of things right. The story is unique, the items are varied and interesting, and it's just the right amount of challenging. But it really misses where it matters. The game is only 5 short procedurally generated levels, and the enemies are all variations of basically the same thing.

This game would really be great with 25+ carefully designed levels. Leave the procedural generation for a side mode.

Avoid the walls that comes flying towards you by moving your little triangle left and right around the shape of, you guess it, a hexagon. But wait! Sometimes the shape your little trianle moves around is a pentago, or, dare I say it, even a square!

Gameplay is fast. Stupidly fast at times, especially if you unlock the higher levels, which, if like me, you have the hand-eye co-ordination of a new-born baby, will be especially tough. I've put double-figure hours into this game, and I've unlocked one level.

"No very 'Soloable' in my opinion

The game is beautiful to look at and makes you feel good right from the start. it is also very fun to play and there is a lot of crafting to do for us crafters. 

Then there is the wake up call. There are overpowered mobs right from the word go, when you die you reappear in a totally different area and have to start from scratch, Very far into the game due to crafting requirements, you can craft a bed which then is the respawn point. 

However count on having to start many times whilst looking for mats or prey. 
I still had a lot of fun until it came for the ore intricate crafting such as cooking, kiln etc etc. 
That is so compicated you feel you go nuts. I have crafted in games for 30 years but never seen anything like it. 
Presentky I am stuck on crafting and don't know if I want to go on. 

For multiplayer it is a different story. You immediately have help not to die the whole time. You have skilled crafters to craft stuff for you etc etc

"If you’re a space games veteran, you’ll find some things in this game that were taken from other space games. For example, you’ll see the large torpedoes and “no need to dodge” countermeasures from “Starlancer”, you’ll remember the flak cannons and ship beams from “Freespace 2”, and you’ll find a Karan S’jet clone. I believe even the missile types are copied from “FS 2”.

What distinguishes this game from the others of its kind is the ability to turn into a mech and fire spread missiles at multiple targets. If you’re a fan of mecha anime, this will be pretty familiar to you. It takes some time to get used to this system. However, once you master it, you’ll be fighting like a real “Macross/Robotech” ace, transforming between mech and fighter in the middle of dogfights.

You should be warned that this game is also more arcade-like than usual. No power management, no radar, no shield convergence. When you fly a bomber, you have an infinite amount of torpedoes. When you restart from a checkpoint, you get a full ammo reload and hull repair.
The story is pretty basic. Colonials want to destroy Earth and that’s all you know about them. There’s nothing about their ideology or personality. There’s no communications from them whatsoever throughout the game, not even a “Surrender or die!”. Enemy units don’t have names, not even the cruisers and carriers.

Mission design is the game’s biggest flaw. When you’re attacking enemy fighters and your flight leader says “ignore the fighters, focus on your objectives”, what she means is “enemy fighters have infinite waves, so don’t bother”. Sometimes you have to take out flak cannons before the bombers come in, sometimes you don’t. Sometimes the objective is to destroy the cruiser, sometimes you have to protect the bombers which will do that for you and it’s mission failed if they get destroyed by those infinite waves of enemy fighters. You’ll see so many enemy ships throughout the campaign, that you’ll wonder if Earth ever had a chance to win the war in the first place. On defense missions, you’ll learn to love checkpoints.

It’s a fun game. Looks easy at first and it only gets hard when you start fighting the Black Fleet. When you master the strike suit, you’ll love flying it. However, if you played classics like “FS 2” and the X-wing or “Wing Commander” series, it’s likely that you won’t take this game seriously.
For example, when I did the bomber mission and realized I had infinite torpedoes plus a ton of missiles for self-defense, I remembered my experience as a TIE Bomber pilot and the bomber tutorial in “FS 2” and I actually laughed.",True

"Very fun arcade off-road racing.

Pros:
* Game modes! Capture the flag, gate hunt, pathfinder, knockout and more. MadMax style action where 6 cars are heading toward the flag or gate from different directions at full speed.
* Map is huge tile repeated infinitely. You can drive forever without hitting map edge. Awesome idea that complements game modes - target can be approached from different angle. For example if way east to the base is crowded with opponents you can return flag by going to the west, north or south. Brilliant idea.

Cons:
* Damage model is very disappointing. Car only loses panels and accessories without drive capability being affected. Only big hits result in ""car broken"" state where all wheels fall off (even when car falls on roof!) and car must be repaired. This is huge downgrade when compared to first 1nsane game where whole car frame could be deformed and watching out not to cripple the car was essential to win.
* Cars do not show advantage on given maps/tracks. Buggy class should be dune master while monster class should dominate crazy jumps. Instead every race can be won in random car.

"TL;DR: Buy YAKUZA 0, NOT Kiwami.

I've played many, many hours of Yakuza 0 and I loved every hour of it. I even gave Yakuza 0 a replay in legendary and enjoyed everything of it - the minigames were fun, the story was very good and the gameplay was very good too. 

If you think Yakuza Kiwami is all that - it's not. 

There are fewer minigames: No real estate ""minigame"", no ""cabaret minigame"", no disco, no old sega arcade games. These things could keep one entertained alright. 

The story is actually okay but nothing compared to Yakuza 0, either - that's however due to the fact that Kiwami is a remake of the original Yakuza 1.

tl;dr gameplay: The fighting sucks, it's more tedious and cheap than geniunely hard. 
The gameplay, that being the ""fighting"" is just ""hard to swallow"". I don't know if they actually bothered playing this game when they first released it on ps4 alright. I get that Kiryu's been in jail for the past 10 years and that he's mean to be  weak. However, that's hardly an excuse for a clumsy and sluggish fighting mechanic. His punches are extremely weak, even with a decently upgraded skill tree (I can't be assed to track majima down without an encounter finder because the game does not feel like it's worth it either). 
Instead of making the opponents more skilled and the fighting just harder (as in the opponents movesets more sophisticated), what they did was to slap knives, swords and pistols on every npc and his grandma. The bosses feel like  they have a bottomless pits of HP available - however, they are very easy to beat - it just takes waaay to long. Personally, I can't be assed to spend 20 minutes circling and whacking Majima down in the batting center just so I can move on. It gets boring. Especially when they start to reheal themselves mid-battle and you have no clue on how to prevent it (see: Kiwami moves).
In fact, Majima is the only one that has decent movesets ... you guessed it, it's his movesets from when he is playable in Yakuza 0. It's fun to fight against Majima at least. But that's about it.

So why do I still recommend this game? Simply speaking, there are far worse games on Steam than this - this game suffers from design decisions - however, you can still make do if you decide to mod the fighting styles to be more like Yakuza 0's - check out the Yakuza modding community for that, for instance. It should not be up to the customer to do this however. The main aspect - fighting - is lackluster. 
I would really like to give this thing a thumbs down but there's just too much trash on steam for me to lump this in with the stuff that really deserves a ""thumbs down"". 

However, if you haven't bought Yakuza 0 yet, I'd say do that instead if anything. Yakuza Kiwami is a weak link in the series and should really only be played by those who like this franchise. It would be wrong to lump this game in with the really bad ones on steam by giving this a thumbs down. 

Yakuza 0 is a game that was crafted with love. Yakuza Kiwami feels like a moneygrab. Buy 0.

"I love this game but in it's current state there's a couple of things I'd like to see addressed.

The good:
1: It combines everything I love about left 4 dead and Nazi Zombies. It's glorious.
2: It's challenging and encourages team play. I play a lot of co-op games and only this and Payday 2 get it right. This is even better than payday 2 as it doesn't rely on cheesy tactics like cloakers and van mounted auto-turrets to kill you.
3: Mod support. There's already a few really interesting custom maps out, like remakes of old Goldeneye64 maps out which will add a lot to this title.
4: Graphics. It's beautiful and well made. It runs well even at 4k DSR on my GTX 980.
5: It has a roadmap. Unlike a lot of early access bullsh*t these days, these guys have a plan. It's already pretty polished so the developers are literally just looking for bug reports and feedback at this stage.

The bad:
1: The run speed and animation. It kind of feels like you're wading slowly through custard. Not game breaking by any means but more of a slight annoyance.

Was extremely disapointed in the game. Maybe I had really high expectations, this game honstely looks and feels like its still in alpha and has a long road ahead till full release. 

For now, I'm going to refund. Maybe come back in a few months and see if they've made any improvements.

Yes yes this is an arcade game, but just because its an arcade game it doesn't mean it should look like its come from the 90's. Monster energy supercross is such a pretty game, its hard to come from that, to this and not get sore eyes.

"BattleBlock Theater is an awesome, raging, hilarious, and strategic game. It is loads of fun and has a lot of levels. 

[h1]+Pros[/h1]
+Can get some cool heads
+Cool design
+Nice music
+Can't finish in an hour or two
+Multiplayer
+Many game-modes
+TWO ways to play the story
+Nice weapons
+Can trade with other players while In-Game

[h1]-Cons[/h1]
-Last Act is extremely hard! (but is possible to beat) (this isn't really a con because who would want to play a game that was easy?)
-Have to have an internet connection most of the time to save data
-It gets kinda hard to get gems, not really hard just a little, very little

[h1]Achievements[/h1]
Achievements are not hard(most of them). Also if you are having trouble there are tons of guides that can help you with one or all of them. There is one achievement that you can only get if you play with a friend/player who has it. 

[h1]Bugs[/h1]
There are no current bugs that I know of or have had any problems with.

 BattleBlock Theater also has full controller compatibility, or you could use your keyboard. The game runs extremely well on low end computers and PCs. Overall the game is super fun and is definitely worth its price. I hope you decide to buy it and have loads of fun playing it!",True
"You may be questioning the authenticity of an RPG and RTS mixture, so I'll explain in simple terms;

RPG elements used in this game are similar to that of most others, with elves, dragons, trolls and the rest. You can choose and blend from different classes, then use points to improve your character's performance across 6 stats, making customization very flexible. The game has a large leap in difficulty after the first few levels, rewarding the educated players and punishing those who rush through it aimlessly.

The RTS (real time strategy) portion of the game makes up a vast amount of the combat. You can build camps for you and your workers, then fund an army with resources and carefully plan out assaults on enemy camps. Much like the Civilization games, it is imperative to protect your camps or you may find yourself tumbling back to the start of the stage and losing everything you've worked for.

There are some downsides, such as abusable power and mechanics that limit challenge, but for a player that wants a real tactical adventure, this is near enough the perfect game for it. I played it a lot on it's CD form, so I can honestly say that it does not get boring.",True

"A fun if somewhat repetitive medieval combat game. It is notable for its recognition of the inequality in sexes.  A female character will have to work twice as hard as a male to get the same recognition, however that is entirely fitting in this games medieval setting.  I think the game would have been more interesting if it were set on earth.  Unfortunately the game is set on another world where five miscellaneous factions are vying for power.  This lack of historical perspective does give the game a blank canvas to work with, but the reality of it is an empty world were all the factions actions seem a little irrational.

"I join the masses with a great big thumbs up to this one!!

Bottom line: I nearly didn't buy it. I mean, i was young when Doom came out. I got the original box in the mail after getting the floopy disks as shareware FFS! So yeah, I'm old. And nostalgic. But that's why i nearly DIDN'T buy this. I mean, nostalgia is great, but lets face it, Doom was probably good as much as anything because it was so ground-breaking. Doing those graphics now, in a simplistic, and short game, seemed like a bad idea. And the game isn't really THAT cheap...

But I tried it. And I think it's excellent.

The level design is brilliant. Genuinely. You need to retrace steps to find new things, it's not mind-numbingly simple and 'on rails'. 

The graphics, while clearly 'bad', do that bad thing so well it really is like being 'back in the day' - in a good way.

The music? Well, that's execellent. 'Nuff said about that.

The game play? It's VERY fast paced, like Doom, like Quake, Like Hexen and Heretic. Rise of the Triads. All those great old titles. You have to keep moving most of the time. You have adrenaline running. Walls drop to reveal bad guys jumping all over your ass. And it does it well. REALLY well.

And the story is there. It's subtle. You have to read a few things on the walls and piece it together, but it's kinda nice to have a bit of a story, but one that isn't too obvious. It creates a world, and leaves you hanging for more. The atmosphere is really spot on.

One note, when I finished the first chapter I actually didn't realise the game comes with all three. I didn't even notice when I started the campaign I selected the first chapter. This may be obvious to some, but wasn't to me. It was when I was disappointed with how short it was I realised that actually all three chapters were already part of the game.

"Bloodbath Kavkaz isn't really an awful game but the main problem here is the poor game design. The developers don't seem to understand what made Hotline Miami so hectic since it's deliberately a clone/ rip off HM in nearly every aspect.

Like you got to spray across the map to know where the enemies are as your camera view is very limited or else u gonna get killed rushing in. Stealth & planning for rampage is non existent in this game unlike Hotline Miami. Collision detection in BK is quite glitched to point where I would teleport out of map.

Also this game is UNPLAYABLE on a AMD card thanks to horrible optimization. Don't get me wrong, there's mindless shooting fun & giggles to be had with Bloodbath Kavkaz but my experience with it was a complete train wreck.

Btw, why the hell doesn't this game have proper audio adjustment? I seriously gonna flip from hearing deformed fools screaming on top of their lungs every 5 seconds.

Don't buy this game at least not yet sure it isn't very buggy but since it has no optomisation after being out about a year and a half which can make it play at really low FPS and I mean like 5 to 7 fps which is unacceptable even fo an early access game but apart from that the gameplay is very good if you can manage to play the game.

"If, like me, you love this game and CoD hasn't quite felt the same since 2010, and if, also like me, you wish you could find consistent lobbies that aren't filled with hackers, then I have the solution for you: !W4x (IMPORTANT: the ""!"" is actually an ""I"" but it gets censored if I use the actual name). Please disregard the fact that this review may read more like an advertisement than an objective analysis but i digress. Please google !W4x MW2 and install it, it's free. What is !W4x you might ask? It's a modded version of MW2 to establish dedicated servers (just like Cod4). There are so many things great about it so I will name a few here:

1) Dedicated servers (I know, I said this already but it's very important)
2) You can unlock all the weapons, attachments and callsigns by going into the Barracks, so you don't have to play the game all over again. However, if you like the personal achievement of unlocking everything, you can reset and level up for fun
3) Some of the servers ban irritating things in the game like noobtubes or change all deathstreaks to be Copycat. In my opinion, this is a good thing, as it balances out the playing field a little more. However, if you miss that good ol grenade launcher, you can definitely find a server that allows them. 
4) Dedicated servers
5) Game modes that aren't available in MW2 Vanilla, like Gun Game, and maps from other COD games like Nuketown. 
6) More guns that aren't available in MW2 Vanilla, like the AK74u. 
7) Dedicated servers

Once again, google !W4x and follow the instructions to download. You can also add it to Steam and use the overlay just like regular MW2. If anyone has any issues installing, post in the comments and I'll try to link some fixes or guides that worked for me. It also has dedicated servers, not sure if I mentioned that yet or not.",True

"DayZ, an MMO set in the fictional country of Chernarus, is a modern-day civil war simulator where players get to experience a life of 'absolute anarchy'. The map is an impressive 225 sq km, which is completely irrelevant because you will spend most of your time sat in one spot, in Berezino battling over the police station or dead.  

If you think that is all, you're a mistaken fool. For there is a subplot which many do not know about. During this civil strife, a zombie-like infection plagues the very few NPC's in the game. Occasionally, you will stumble across a zombie (maybe two if your 'unlucky') who will try to attack you. However running in circles around them will soon make them trip over their pathfinding.

This is not a post-apocalyptic game. It is not a zombie game. It's not even a finished game (and sadly it has the right to never be finished). If you haven't jumped in yet, don't. The game has had enough support and you should probably stick with the mod.

I didn't go on my computer for a few weeks before the summer(when the game split in two) and when i got back I couldn't login in. I tried everything and I also contacted them and got no response.

"One of the very few sandbox games that I truly enjoy. This games doesn't take itself serious and goes way out of bounds. It makes fun itself, it makes fun of other games, movies and other pop culture. The music is surplus (at least the hit channel, playing haddaway, aerosmith and countless other 90s songs). The sandbox gameplay changes for sidescrolling beat em ups, racing and flying sims, endless runners and much more. Character creation is a blast, you can create anything. The game looks extremely polished and runs uncompareable smooth and fast. If you want a laff or two and enjoy sandbox games, get it!",True

Instead, the storytelling keeps getting better, more relatable, and more personal as the game goes on. They nailed what they were going for.

Things like bankruptcy really make you scramble and figure out how to get out of it. I wish the enemy AI did a bit more but other than that this is a super solid game and I highly reccomend Endless Space 2 for anyone on the fence of playing a 4X game.

"Still early but it's already feeling like Capcom finally learned the right lessons from the older games instead of the wrong lessons. Still very ""Resident Evil"" but without the Michael Bay cluster some titles turned into.

Also fewer ""quick time"" like sequences, at least so far, frankly makes the game feel more immersive. The audio is solid even with just a set of half decent headphones.

If I had one gripe, I wish one of the baseline pistols was a tad more damaging OR critical headshots occured slightly more often*, even if only with one weapon, but so far this is the most entertaining RE title they've released in a while.

(*And I DO mean a TAD. Mainly because it's just so satisfying when those heads finally go pop and you make a clean getaway. The game has just enough zombies I feel they could risk a little more on the critical hit side of things without seriously skewing the balance. Especially as the game has multiple enemy types effectively immune to such a mechanic.)",True

"[h1]Fishing: Barents Sea[/h1]
[u]A good arcade commercial fisher[/u]

I wanted a fishing/crabbing game to fill the void of Deadliest Catch: Alaskan Storm for a long time. I was one of the few people that really enjoyed that game. Fishing: Barents Sea did a very good job of filling that void.

Fishing: Barents Sea is a commercial fisher based on longline, net, and trawling both Pelagic and Bottom. It does have a Crabbing DLC but with no additional achievements I doubt I'll buy.

Good array of boats, starting from a little handed down single crew fishing boat up to giant multi crew trawlers. The first person mode and being able to walk around your ship is great. However I wish you could interact more with the ship in this mode.

Relaxing gameplay and nice suitable music.

The graphics are nice and the water effects are very good with nice swells in stormy weather etc. The longline/net catching and gutting mechanics are quite refreshing and different

The only real issue I have is game longevity and ease. Everything was over so quick, as a bit of an achievement hunter I do like a long term achievement, I'm not one of this instant gratification types who play Zup! to get 1000 achievements in 10 minutes but I do like the harder time consuming achievement as a target to grind towards. The catch 1000 tonnes of Mackerel sounds intimidating but I achieved that in 3 Trawler runs and 100 percented the game in 26 hours. I am aware the game does not really end and you can play for the leader boards in sandbox.

I wish the achievements were harder and took more time to achieve and I wish there was more elements of danger and random events, like Alaskan Storm.

I think this is a good game made by a small studio and they deserve props for it. I look forward to what they do in the future!

Also Dev's if you add achievements to the crabbing DLC I will buy it :D

This game has really hilarious moments but a pretty slow start so you'll have to be patient for a bit before things get sweet (or spicy if you have H scenes turned on) The whole plot is pretty neutral, there's no deep dive into the romance per se, just slight hints here and there before the sudden romance development, which is okay I guess, because it escalates super fast with the H scenes. Sometimes the protag can be annoying but then I just remember that at that age, some girls are really that dense and insecure.

"The biggest issue NeuroVoider faces is that its level of randomization and customization is nowhere near what the game's trailer suggests.

You get to select a player class, which really only alters your special move (a dash, a shield, or a sort of berzerker mode); you can select second special of your choosing, an active or passive ability of your choice; you can select your two weapons, and while there are a staggering amount of different options, you'll soon find two that work best for you and seldom even look at other variations; and you can select your head, body, and locomotion modules, but each of them are basically flatly 'upgrades' or 'downgrades' with very minor differences between base stats to act as sidegrades.

Similarly, most enemies are very similar: Swarms of minor enemies, the occasional big, tough enemy, and four main bosses that are effectively all the same boss with minor weapon variants. As a result, the same strategy you use on any given stage should work pretty well on all of them. Also, most of the stages are very similar - there aren't really any interesting rooms or setpieces like most roguelites and most of the different location options look, honestly, visually very similar as well. I makes the option of location feel kind of pointless, really, aside from the differences in loot amount elite enemies, and general map size.

The end result is a game that lures you in with the promise of tons of customization, but you spend far more of your time just grinding and upgrading your setup that works for you to help you take down slightly stronger variations of the same enemies again and again than you do customizing anything or trying to tailor your approach to specific obsticles. And, of course, since 90% of your customization is straight upgrades, you really don't even feel that sense of lucky/unlucky a loot-based roguelite should give by dropping particularly grand loot in your lap or lackthereof - you'll get it eventually because it's just part of the game's progression.

In the game itself there is no singleplayer story mode.
Ubisoft stated that the focus on Rainbow Six Siege was mainly on compelling cooperative and multiplayer experience. It does however has singleplayer terrorist hunt and training missions. Which let you get familiar with the different operators to choose from.
So what more does Rainbow Six Siege has to offer?

[b]Terrorist Hunt[/b]

In terrorist hunt you play different missions on either normal, hard or realistic difficulty with either friends or random people versus a.i. controlled enemies. These missions are almost the same as the multiplayer. But the difference is that in terrorist hunt more enemies will swarm around since they are a.i. controlled enemies.
But don't let their appearance fool you. These a.i. enemies will literally break down doors and windows to hunt you down. Or even blow themselves up while taking you with them.

[b]Multiplayer[/b]

The multiplayer in Rainbow Six Siege is the cream of the crop.
In the multiplayer you have the attacking and defending side.
The attacking side has to either rescue a hostage, defuse a bomb or capture a bomb side while the defending side had to prevent it.

At the start of a match you pick one of the twenty-six operators depending on if you are attacking or defending. All these operators needs to be unlocked by earning renown that you earn by playing the game.

When everyone has picked their operator the 45 seconds preparation timer is starting.
Within this time the attacking team needs to locate the objective and find the defending team.

The defending team however has to prepare for the coming attack.
They can do this by reinforce walls so they can't be breached, setting up traps and get in position for the attack.

After the preparation timer it time to start the siege.
At this point the round has 4 minutes left for the both teams to eliminate or secure the objective.

But what makes the gameplay so great is that every around feels like a problem solving game.
Most of the times you really need to plan how you want to breach in a building.
One big part of the problem solving is what operator did you picked to breach.

For instance on the attacking side the operator Termite is has two Exothermic charges which lets you breach reinforced walls. Termite is only one of the two operators able to blow up reinforced walls. Which makes him useful to create a new path.

But if we look at the defending side there is the operator Mute that can place signal disrupter's.
And if placed at reinforced wall Termite cant use his Exothermic charge anymore until the signal disrupter is destroyed.

Its basically feels like a rock, paper and scissors game.

This is what I like the most about Rainbow Six Siege.
It's satisfying to play a game with slow paced teamwork.
And the feeling that very round feels different and unpredictable makes it great.

[b]Season Pass[/b]

Yes, almost every game these days has a season pass and Rainbow Six Siege isn't any different.
But it is important to mention that the season pass of Rainbow Six Siege is different as most other games.

Because you don't need the season pass to play new maps or new released operators.
They are being released for free for everyone to play.

The thing season pass owners get is some exclusive skins, instantly unlock new operators and get a week early play time with these new operators.

But all the new maps are free for everyone to enjoy.
And the new operators can be unlocked by renown by everyone with renown.

Final Verdict

Are you looking for a bit slower paced shooter and thinking a bit more strategic before rushing in a building with enemies. Than you should definitely try this game out.

"Quick rating of the game.


Story: 6/10, it's not really clear what the actual story is, however the mystery of this makes the game different 

Gameplay: 5/10, the mechanics are pretty simple and the spaceship battling is poorly done.

sound/music: 9/10: this is where they hit the spot, the music/sounds are near damn perfect for this game

Fun factor: so far i played over 10 hours, only times i am bored, is when i am waiting for a storm to end, or when i travel from ""point"" to ""point"" 

Repeativeness: 4/10: you pretty much do the same thing on the planets, however the amount of different things you can do makes up for it somewhat, and the ""story"" implementation makes it pretty worthwhile to proceed the grind.

So i actually i have playtime and yes the performence is poor at times, (not that i have a gtx 1080 or the new titan) but i still manage to enjoy the game for the hours i played so far, i don't really find it that repetetive as some claim, i seen plenty of different speices, and the traders react differently, even stumpled upon a puzzle one time, wont spoil the ""story"" but i for one is following the atlas storyline and it's pretty damn cool so far.

Only downside is the performence else i am getting what i paid for (not AAA worthy, but if you enjoy exploring and occasional spaceship battling i'd say buy it on sale)",True
Excellent game! It follows suite from the previous two installments and keeps getting better. A fantastic motorcycle sim - well worth adding to your collection.,True
"Such a instant classic. I put sooo many hours into this game on the 360 and thought, why not get it for pc?
Fantastic game series (one of my favourites) simple game play, so much replayablity (although I loose intrest in a game very quick if there isnt any progression or customization this is a exeption) This is probably one of the only games that I find I need to be sticking with my team and feel like I relie on them alot of the time to save my ass from hunters and smokers. Great unique characters, had a fantastic sequel and cant wait for the rumored l4d3 which is rumored to realese this year which I would be suprised if that werent true.

Only thing is I wish it could have more campains but there is left 4 dead 2 which has new campains with the old too and the workshop which freshens the game.

Overall a must have for anyone into the fps genre.

"If you don't know yet Bastion is a top downish shooter. By that I mean it's off at an angle. The music is good. It's a strong part of the game. The voice acting is well done. It's only one person but he does well with what he's given. The game play feels a little floaty to me honestly.  Not so much that it's unplayable but just floaty. Maybe it was meant to be that way. Either way I had fun with the game. It was a typical story just told a little different. I felt as if it dragged in the end but by that point I wanted to know what would happen.

"Music: Bops 
Graphics: Pop
Fighting: Non-stop 

While it is only slightly more difficult to master that it is to learn, it does have a sufficient amount of strats required if you want to win consistently; which have as much to do with positioning and timing as weapon choice. Any balance issues one may feel are few and far between; most easliy circumvented through timing and creativity. I would argue the Bow is probably the only legitimately frustrating weapon, but I get kills with it too. I adore this game. 

The only actual downside is that the default matchmaking is pretty dead. If you do enjoy it I'd say just by several copies for your friends; wait for it to go on sale if you have to. Look up the Discord and get in other communities though, and you'll be able to scrounge up some fights regularly. It's also tons of fun locally; if you've got your friends in the same room having snacks and smashing Nidhogg it's a good time for all. If you're looking for an equal parts goofy and challenging platform to stomp your mates in for a rousing good time, then look no further.",True

"This game is an absolute pain to play. On one hand it tries to make me delve into the frantic chaos of a redneck derby bonanza, while at the same time creating restrictions constantly reminding me that ""this is a game, and we have strict rules here, Sir"". I hate redneck culture, it's dumb as shit. I figured some exposure therapy and a fun game about driving fast and crashing cars might change that, but I guess not. Also, starting with a car covered with the 'merica star spangled banner. 

Good experiences:
• When you tinker with your cars tuning to realize it made a huge differnce and you pull off a hard race.
• When you manage to keep a skid throughout an entire turn, while maintaining speed.

Shit experiences:
• When you drive slightly off course and a wrong way sign shows up. You return to the road and you drive, but the sign stays there. After a good 45 seconds you reset your car only to be put back to the place where the stop sign first showed up. The game does a good job of creating emmersion, but it also does a damn fine job of pulling it away again.
• Hearing the dreadfull 3 song sound track. If I have to hear that emo kid sing about someone dragging him down and him having to go on (or whatever it was), I'll have to stick a q-tip through my eardrumv. 
• The leveling system as a whole. Oh, I can save up for a sweet car? Well, sort of, but first you have to spend your money buying other shit cars for class specific challenges. You want to build a better car? Buy a new engine? Well, no, you have to level up. You got the level? Well, you also need money. What exactly do I need levels for in a car game? (If you're answer is ""it'll break the game if players save up and buy the best stuff to begin with"" then think about balancing the game better rather than introducing a new unecessary mechanic.)
• No introduction or onboarding to the mechanics of the game, and having to guess my way to the fact that the standard for this game is using arrow keys.

To end on a positive note, I have to give the game credit for the looks and the fact that going for a somewhat realistic approach to this type of ""crash and smash"" car game is quite novel.",False

"This game capitalizes on only 3 things

• its so called 'humor'
• and similarity to Don't Starve

Biggest tip I would give: If you like Don't Starve, DO NOT buy this game. Contrary to most reviews I've read which is the opposite. Why? Because although it IS like DS, the integral part of that game that make it so effective is gone. There is no necessity to harvest resources fast and effectively, or build a base that can hold off creatures. You dont feel the need to explore to find more valuable resources.

Instead you are dropped in a planet, where you can survive by just standing still. You can build a base, but totally just because you can, not because you have to.

And then there's the humor. Maybe it was just lost on me, but this game's humor is totally lost on me. 

The whole game feels like a long, un ending, un entertaining fetch-quest that has 0 gratification.

If you REALLY want it, get it when it's on sale. Probably when it's 90% off.",False

"This game to me is a very good game if you take the time to get into it. Yes you will die a hell of a lot in the begining but then you will get up to the point where you get set up and are driving around the map on a mini bike with friends having the time of your life. Huge hint here is that there is a base in the middle of a lake around the center of the map somewhere which is safe even throughout horde night and is a great starting point for beginers. 
  My friend and I personally just have our own private game going where up to 4 people can join but it is private and we enjoy ourselves. The single player is also very good however I have not played on a public server so I can offer no insight into what the community is like in this game.
It has a very indepth crafting and leveling up system which has many perks and small off branches of said perks including the ability to level everything up from your health all the way to being able to level up your crafting and combat skills. A lot of items like clubs and bows as well as tools and armor also have levels that depend on your crafting level(the more you craft the more your crafting goes up, same with all perks)
The base building is also very indepth and works of a block system similar to minecraft only much , much better and way more indepth.
You find gun parts that also have levels which determin how what level the weapon your craft comes out at.
Crafting mini bikes works the same way as guns and boy are they a fun, quick, safe and reliable way to get around the map and explore which might I add is a rather good sized map.
Every 7 days might I add is horde night where a horde attack your base and ravange the place so be ready. Also there are many different zombie types and some be prepeared for a bit of variety including bears, zombie bears and zombie dogs which are MotherF--kin savages.
Pros
Deep Crafting System
Weapons are good
Mini Bikes
Base building is fun
Co-Op/MP
Combat is enjoyable and you can manouver  in and out of hordes of Zombies while shooting them if you've had a lot of experience on the old CoD zombies.
Horde night is great because you have to keep track of time and day which keeps you immersed.
Hunting for food like pigs and deer as well as scavanging for tinned food
Water is easy to find and purify making it easy to stock up meaning more time to mine or explore.
When you die there is a marker on your on screen compass that shows you where your bag full of stuff is.
They are still updating and adding to the game even though it has been in Early Access for just over 3 years(it hasn't been abandoned like so many other Early Access games.
Both pro and con
Zombies going feral at night and running rather than being slow moving dosile morons is both a pro and con because it keeps you on gaurd and keeps you immersed but also limits what you can and can't do at night.
Getting stunned by Zombie hits. It adds to the combat but it can be very frustrating at times to be honest.
Cons:
Graphics aren't the greatest but are still ok. They aren't horrible I'm honestly just a graphics whore and it could maybe run a bit better however it rarerly drops bellow 60 on max @ 1440p.
Sometimes you just get f--ked and die and it can make you have a mini game rage but you'll keep playing and it only happens every now and then lol

2. If you love tsundere girl, we have Uni here.

So why not you buy this? Just click 'add to cart' already dude

Pros :
- All aspects in Neptunia Re;Birth1
- 1 More slot party, make your team more overwhelm the enemy (LoL)
- New Minigame, even i don't know which use of this minigame except for Medal (maybe will give you great plan later?)
- Nepgear there
- I said nepgear there? yeah nepgear there
- Once again nepgear there

Cons :
- I just wonder, why steam give free DLC for Nepgear weapon, it will ruin starting game if you use that.
I mean without that, this game pretty much easy rather than RB1 (Maybe you should activate Fortify Enemy)
- The joke sometimes seems off (i love how neptune and noire back then at RB1, or with blanc and vert). Thanks to puchiko for her nyu.
- I just annoying how the story can be different or not connected with Re;Birth1, for example when first time Neptune meet Compa and IF for first time. Noooo why you do this IF !!

"Rather than a ""thumbs-up/thumbs-down,"" this game really deserves a ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. It's a mixed bag in every sense of the word. As it stands today (ver. 5.05), SFV has deep and expressive gameplay and the best character balance of any entry in the series, but you can't really experience that gameplay because of how poor the online play is. Capcom has announced it will continue support for the game through at least 2021, but they've been so unresponsive to feedback and criticism from the community that it's hard to be optimistic about what that will actually look like. As an entry point into the Fighting Game Community, SFV has one of the most enthusiastic and competitive playerbases in the genre, but the in-person meetups that are the heart and soul of the FGC are on hold until who-knows-when. Street Fighter V is difficult to recommend, but also difficult to repudiate.

For 14.99, there's really no excuse not to play this game.  I just finished it, ~ 12 hours ish of single player story (this is from a genre veteran, on hard mode). Game runs like a dream and music/graphics/gunplay are fantastic. If you enjoy the new Wolfenstien games, this one will feel right at home.",True
"For having been in development for 9 years, it turned out to be a hot mess with little clear direction and purpose. It feels generally unfinished and unsure of itself, leaving a similar unsure feeling in any who try to play it. For what it's worth, the fighting system can be entertaining for a short time, but it's inconsistency means that it is usually not worth the effort to try. 

Certainly not worth $30. Most probably not worth $15. I'd be reluctant to spend even $5 on it in it's current state.",False

"Buggy, the characters are predictable, the dialogue is boring, and the objectives are not well communicated.  The fact that the game is buggy means that meeting criteria will not cause doors to open, etc. But the fact that objectives are not well communicated means that you will not know for sure that you're actually doing the right thing until you do literally EVERYTHING in a nonlinear game without finding a way to advance.  

Example: I just spent an hour playing a very brief section of a level over and over again, unable to get a door to open, so I kept reloading the save and trying again.  Went online, saw I was doing it RIGHT and then reloaded a slightly older save to finally achieve the objective.",False

Yes, there are issues that most likely stem from the game being a labor of love made on a shoestring budget. I can't deny that a number of story arcs end abruptly, and that there are occasional bugs (my copy refuses to register Steam achievements). But I'm a sucker for writing, and this is one of the best-written games I've played in a long while. I desperately want more stories set in this universe. Please, Pyrodactyl, make it happen.",True

"This is like an indie version of State of Decay, it's very well made and is probably one of the most underplayed indie games on steam.    It has all the elements of a good game, good story, good game play, lots of action, though choices, etc.   

You basically have to start your own community and scavange other abandoned towns for supplies.   A lot of people complain about finding insulin for one of your community members however at day 40 of the game when I completed it I still had 11 or some to spare, so there is definitely enough in the game.   The game will make you make tough choices to find insulin in it, which is why there is the need for it.   If you don't play it the right way and let the person die that needs it, you will not get the full experience of the game, so make sure you play it right.   

You will interact with other communities, you'll have to make some difficult decisions with them.   A lot of decisions you make can have unintended consequences, so choose wisely.

"While The Escapists originally is a brilliant game, its the Walking Dead spin-off is not.

While loosely following the story, this entire game feels awfully constructed, convoluted and mindbogglingly grindy, as literally almost anything out there is out to kill you and the combat mechanics of The Escapists isn't that great to begin with.

Even as a huge fan of the TWD franchise, I really couldn't get myself to like this one bit, which is kind of sad.",False
"Terrible game!

Guns are boring, story is only there to be skipped, and you cant even skip the first 30 min cinematic before you start. Every ally in the game is only there to die for you to revive and then continue doing nothing. If you ever die in the game it is things you cant see. Everything that looks like it could kill you, can barely harm you. Everything is a meaningless bullet sponge.

"Let's just go straight to the point. This game had a lot of potential but the developers have absolutly no clue how to make a game and now Ark is just a pile of garbage. The game has many bugs that were there in early access but the devs never cared to fix them. The progression system is terrible. For example, the turtle saddle requires cementing paste to make but you learn cementing paste a few levels after the turtle saddle. The building system is terrible, more specifically the wires and pipes aswell as the objects that use them. They don't snap to foundations so you end up with a complete mess around your base. The game is horribly optimized, I get better fps playing than I do in the inventory screen. And in engram screen I only get about 8-11 fps with a gtx 1070. They released a full expansion pack while in early access which in my opinion is their worst offence. So instead of fixing/improving their game they tried to sell out more of the same garbage content that we already had. And speaking of that they have the sponsored mod program, which I normally would be completly supportive of, but Studio Wildcard is using resources on helping mod devs make their mods instead of  fixing the game.

I cannot and will NOT RECOMMEND this game to anyone.",False

Cant really think of anything negativa to say tbh, except i wish it was longer.. but hey all good things must come to an end.

"Made for an interesting 30 minutes, and it was enjoyable to the end. I will recommend this, but with a warning... This game is better suited to children or as a low-challenge platformer to kill time. There is nothing inherantly wrong with the game, but it uses a lot of the tropes that would define old school platformers...

[spoiler] Reusing levels, simple enemies, and the biggest challenge being from human error [/spoiler]

I have to admit, it was getting a little stale before it finished even in just 30 minutes. To be fair to the developer though, it is mostly because I have played videogames all my life - just because it uses stereotypes doesn't mean it is a bad game. The artwork was simplistic, though vibrant. I believe that was its intention, and it certainly gave the game a good feeling. The music was calming, with enough diversity to not be repetitive. The only real downside in the way of gameplay would be the lack of a sense of loss on player death, since [spoiler] you don't appear to have a counter / life system and enemies stay dead when you respawn. [/spoiler] On the other hand, it makes the game smoother overall with its current checkpoint system, so again it is a double-edged sword in my honest opinion.

I would have happily paid for this. Not a huge sum, but for around £2 - £5 (GBP). Although it is not something I would play frequently, I can see me coming back to it on the odd rainy day some point in the future.

Overall verdict - 7/10


EDIT - I should also point out that while the game states it supports gamepads, I went through this using the arrow keys. There didn't seem to be any way to use WASD, and no options that I could find to redefine keys, which was a pain since I am on a laptop, but only one or two levels really felt limited by this. Since my controller is a bluetooth gamepad and not a typical xbox style (my regular xbox gamepad isn't working at the moment) I figure I have to mention that this game did NOT have any way for me to use my generic/cheap controller. That is, no xinput dll configuration file for apps like xbox360ce to work with - the game directory seems to be just the .exe file. So, if you are one of the few without an official controller, I would direct you to a keymapper software such as AutoHotKey.",True

"Frictional Games makes solid games with a simple and straightforward gameplay but well structured plots and atmospheres. 

It is a horror game where the sense of dread is given by lack of light, disturbing noises and the feeling that you are never really safe. Add the fact you aren't supposed to defend yourself but rather hide and seek ways to progress and you got a good recipe for horror games.

The plot of SOMA is quite interesting, offering the good old apocalypse scenario but with different challenges and solutions to ensure the survival of mankind. Probably inspired by Asimov's literature, there is a lot of debate around the nature of mankind in relationship with robots and the transfer of coscience.

"Recommendation Caveat: A fair amount of this game's humor value will be lost if you aren't particularly interested in what goes on behind the scenes during the creation of a game, or at the very least some kind of creative collaborative project. It's not that you won't 'get' the jokes, but more that it's mostly a collection of petty squabbles and cross-purposes that likely aren't nearly as funny if you haven't been forced to deal with similar situations in the past.

Pros:

+ Good writing (with one caveat I'll explain in more depth later)
+ Simple mechanics that allow for experimentation and exploration

Cons:

- Requires a bit too much backtracking in a few areas
- Quite short (3 Hours for me, with only a bit of wandering around in search of secrets)

Your Milage May Vary:

* Pokes fun at the clashing of different game development ideologies
* Purposefully 'unfinished' aesthetic

----

It's definitely a fun premise for a game. A man is working on the sequel to an accidental smash hit he made years ago... and has been doing so for more than a decade, with the help of a 'pro-gamer' who helped it gain noteriety in the first place and a super-fan seeking to make the next iteration everything it can possibly be, with or without its originator. You, as a sort of ascended Character Controller, are tasked by an unknown force with moving through what working bits and pieces exist in the game world in order to... well, you don't know what you're trying to do at first, and once you learn the story doesn't develop too much further, so I won't spoil it here.

In any event, you quickly gain the ability to hack game assets and frankenstein their abilities into various little minions in order to solve puzzles. It plays this up as something that more or less grants you total power over the world, and for a time it certainly feels that way - stripping the legs off of a dog-creature to bring a mushroom to life and let it follow you around like a loyal pet is fun in a dark, sadistic sort of way - but eventually the novelty wears off and it's clear that the ability has very clear limits, designed specifically to keep you on track and solve puzzles in mostly static ways.

But that's okay, at least in my opinion. The system is still fun in and of itself, and it means more attention can be paid to the plot when it pops up. The narrative actually has very little to do with you as the player. instead, it focuses on /why/ the development of the game you inhabit has stalled for Duke Nukem Forever lengths of time, as well as the dissatisfaction with the situation coming to a head amongst the employees. If you have memories of disaster-plagued group projects in high-school, college, or work, it should resonate pretty strongly with you. It's well-written, well-acted, and really encapsulates (in a caricature-ish kind of way) what happens when leading individuals in a creative endeavor have entirely different end goals - or worse, no clear goals whatsoever.

This all comes to a head in a somewhat preachy, extremely long-winded speech by the 'esteemed writer' at a not-quite-E3 press event where... lots of things happen that security /really/ should have interrupted. Quickly. Instead of not at all, the way it turns out in the game. It's awkward, really, and is the only bit of the game's writing that honestly had me shaking my head in confusion and apathy.

And then it was over, barely three hours into my play session, dropping me into a mode where I could see if I could toss together passable levels using a combination of the game's usual 'throw states on a creature' gameplay and some creative tools. While seemingly good for a mode taped to the end of another game, I'm not sure it was actually something that would pull me back in now that I've completed the story mode.

All in all, was it worth $20? Eh... Barely. I definitely enjoyed my experience with the game and recommend it if you're at all interested in game development or creative writing of some sort, but that's a steep price to pay for the amount of content that you don't have to build yourself. If it sounds like it might be up your alley, wait for a sale, but definitely check it out!",True

"This is the weird mashup between Jet Grind Radio, Ratchet and Clank, and State of Decay that on launch nobody understood. The promotional videos are confusing, the marketing was weird, and for an Xbox Only Exclusive this wasn't the self-aware Zombie Satire open-world game Dead Island had cracked the door on.

Fast forward to now and a Windows Client that works in Steam Proton, and this is an amazing relevant social commentary on the looming Biden Economy, the Socialist Stormtroopers, and Democrats pushing for a Blood War where as long as American's Kill Americans they win. 

At the same time this is also a surprisingly upbeat, positive, almost too joyful for it's own good, 4th wall shattering Open-World that doesn't make sense as something to play... until you actually play it. I know Insomniac couldn't have had the Democrat fueled lockdowns of 2020 in mind when they wrote this game, and they sure didn't have in mind the US Democrats working with a Soros Voting Machine at the factory level to delete 2.87million + Trump Votes and convert at least that many to Biden votes. Still, it's almost eerily prescient how Insomniac portrayed Average Citizens coming to terms,  or NOT coming to terms, with a Socialist Corporation / Politically fueled apocalypse forced upon the populace... and how nearly everyone suffering under that apocalypse came to terms with the fact that their only way out... is to fight it out. 

Playing this game now makes me wonder just how much of modern America is looking at each other in their homes, in their jobs, where they eat, where they game, and realizing... There aren't many non-violent options left to overthrow an Evil Corporation / Political Party. 

Covered in orange soaked energy drink, Sunset Overdrive is probably the mirror modern gamers need to be staring into, the non satirical behavior patterns shared between FizzCo in-game and the Democrat party in Real-Life should be discussed and analyzed. Somebody at Insomniac was familiar with living under Socialist regimes, that's clear in the writing, and back when this game launched, maybe it was their own little form of rebellion and subervsion. Telling the truth of how Socialism is when those who control means of productions are not responsible for those means of production.

Your characters classes are dull. It gives the hint of leveling up freedom to bend the classes somewhat, but with the point system your basically making one type of character, or making a super weak useless character that ""breaks the mold"".

- Sometimes you get millions for free, other times you'll have to grind days for something, please make it consistent, sometimes a bonus is nice like for example the casino rewards, but make the grind more enjoyable by adding some much needed balance to it (repricing things, making it more of a slope than a combination between an elevator power by rocket engines and climbing the mount Everest)
- The entire gamemode with all progress you made can stop if one person leaves or trolls by committing suicide, wasting up to hours of your time accomplishing nothing)

Just making improvements to the queue system will make my score from a 4/10 go to a 9/10, because the amount of frustration that comes from the queuing system is really killing all the amazing fun you can have in this game.",False

The roman tesutudo is absolutely garbage without mods, factions were doing nothing but recruiting slingers and they destroyed any army.

"One of my favorite games back in college. I never bought it before but I bought it now so I can pay respect to the hardwork put into this incredible game. Also, it's heavily discounted right now (this is primarily the reason. lol) But it's a great casual game for when you have time to kill alone. Thrilling too! You'd think it's too easy but wait till the harder levels! I think this would be a fun game for kids as well. Will definitely encourage them to learn strategies and managing ""sun money"" in the simplest way possible. :)",True

"Things that are great

- Looks great. I mean, pretty damn good. Realist weather effects
- Space is fun
- Class systems and RPG elements. Love the skill tree.
- Weapons are fun
- Crafting is fun

Things that need work

- User interface. I get that they want to have a fully fleshed out experience, but as it sits there are an overwhelming array of options. A real visual clutter. Just because something is complicated - and having a crafting heavy survival game can get complicated- doesn't necessarily mean it needs to look complex. 
- Multiplayer system. This needs to be much more straightforward, especially playing with and inviting friends, as well as having some kind of HUD map system where I can keep track of them within the game. Multiplayer seems like it could be a real core part of the game, and I'm confused its not easier to use.
- A tips/tutorial system? I understand that there will be a learning curve with any game, but I can't play games I feel I need to reinvent the wheel with or constantly be Googling 'how tos' to learn how to use. 

- There are a few other things I can pick at, but what it comes down to is that there are a lot of simple game mechanics that could be streamlined with either more input from the people that play this game and, if this isn't already in place, (apologies if it is. I didn't see it) an in game bug/gameplay issue reporting system that same as I've seen in games such as Subnautica. 

- As it sits, the game has big potential and I wish I could be there to support this now, but there's too much that needs work for me to get a lot out of the game.",False

Fantastic game, just buy it.

If you love souls games then you'll love this, there are very few issues that i have personally found with this title, and almost all of them are tiny nitpicks.

"The original Tomb Raider is certainly a mixed bag. It's not really a contentious observation to say that the controls are completely awful, as Lara handles about as gracefully as a cow on a forklift, courtesy of her tank controls, but the actual gameplay once you get the hang of it is actually quite fun.

One thing I quite liked about this game's story compared to the general perception of Lara Croft these days, is that for all intents and purposes Lara is NOT a hero. Protagonist, sure, but she's depicted here as a callous adrenaline junkie who is roped into the plot strictly through the promise of thrills, and sticks it through to the end basically just to spite the people who tried to kill her.

I actually found this characterization fairly interesting, and was glad to see that in truth Lara does in fact have a personality outside of her bust size (which never much mattered to me, personally I think her most attractive physical asset would be her toned abs, which soften out after the third game in favor of a more generic swimsuit physique). Shame it meant so little to the developers and the public consciousness that each reboot of Lara might as well be an entirely different person.

The game actually shows quite a bit of restraint throughout, and while you do gun down dozens of endangered animals throughout the adventure, the body count is much, much lower than an equivalent game made today would ever be. Your final human kill count by the end is SIX (or even five depending on how you classify the final boss), and even the animals you kill are largely brief encounters with one or two at a time to keep you on your toes - for the most part the game is content to let you solve the platforming puzzles in peace.

The game's biggest flaw, as is a sad recurrance, is its final level. Tomb Raider's interpretation of Atlantis is certainly a new one - gilded Ry'leh isn't something I expected - but let's set some new standards, alright? Developers: you're not allowed to set your final level inside a colon anymore. I know you're trying to go for an offputting atmosphere, but it looked like crap in Halo 3, it looked like crap in Tomb Raider, it looked like crap in Half-Life, and it looked like crap every time it was done in Dead Space. 

But that's not the issue I have with the final level. The issue is quite simply that it's not very well designed. From the start I picked up on the feeling that the developers were starting to run out of ideas, with nonsensical puzzles that couldn't be passed off as ancient puzzle-based security systems, but it was around the penultimate boss fight and afterwards that cinched the deal: medpacks basically stop being a thing. I managed to get a pretty good distance without needing to heal through skill and perseverance, but in the end I had to give up and watch the ending cutscene on YouTube (since I couldn't get the level skip cheat to work).

Being down to essentially my last sliver of health, the game had suddenly turned into I Wanna Be The Guy as every trap would kill me instantly, and certain drops became literally impossible as I couldn't even handle the minute damage from falling that far. I suspect this is a typical side effect of the developers running out of time or money or energy for proper playtesting and rushing the product to shelves. In the end though I had a lot of fun with this, even if I couldn't experience the last 20-odd minutes of gameplay myself.",True

"DQXI is a highly polished game featuring many well-thought-out mechanics, a decent cast of characters, a formulaic story that nonetheless holds a couple of surprises, lots of visual goodies, a sizeable amount of items (including crafting), side- and main quests and a simple if catchy soundtrack.

High point of the game for me was the character design and the insane amount of gorgeous monsters, often cute and menacing at the same time. Everything in Erdrea - including architecture - looks like it floated straight in from a page of Toriyama's Dr. Slump or Dragonball. I wholeheartedly recommend Dragon Quest XI for everyone who likes turn-based RPGs, I certainly had a lot of fun with it.",True
"This game is fun as hell, it is half ass'd in some ways such as the characters having no facial expressions, and mediocre music soundtracks, but the fighting and the work they did on the characters is really good, if you look hard enough, you will see the passion they put into this game.

The combat and controlls are slightly similar to the Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm games but the controlls are much more easier.

The character creation leaves you with very limited options but you can use the games currency to buy costumes and cosmetics to help with that a bit.

It's a good game not a great game so probably wait for it to go in sale for atleast 50% off before you decide to buy it.",True

Also, because of how the game plays and how numerous the possibilities, the game keeps me coming back for more.

However, as the game continues in its development I would like to see the AI improved. At the time of my posting this they seem to be too accurate. They almost always make a hit while human players may struggle to do so without the use of a software attachment on a turret. I would also like to see their navigation improve because sometimes they fly into a narrow space and just spin around in circles and they seem to crash quite often.

- beautiful aesthetic and quite creepy/haunting at some stages
- some genuinely interesting and unique puzzles

"The best thing about this game is the visual aspect, if you want to buy it for the gameplay, then I would not recommend it because that’s not what the game is about. The game lets you go through really beautiful locations, it genuinely feels like you are moving inside an artistic masterpiece. I find the game very soothing, and somehow it helped me with my insomnia, it’s very relaxing. 

I don’t like artistic games a lot but I found myself immersed in this game. Everything about it is beautiful! The soundtrack, the colors, the simplistic story, it’s all great! 

PROs:
-	Great soundtrack.
-	Great visuals.
-	Simplistic.
-	Controlling the character is easy and it doesn’t feel odd like some other artistic games. I personally used an XBOX 360 controller.


Cons:
-	The story could have been expanded
-	It would have been better if I were able to interact more with the environment

"This game is fun, and as a space-themed strategy game about building a base in the middle of nowhere.  That part is fine.  What is not fine however, is how the devs abandoned this game part way through development.  Good thing I bought this on a really great sale when it was around the first few versions.  I cannot recommend this game unfortunately, even though I do actually like the game itself.  Wait for a sale if you want to buy it.  Anyway, here are some pros and cons.

Pros:

+ The game is fun, if you are patient.
+ The community for this game is releasing unofficial updates to the game.
+ Can actually present an occasional challenge.

Cons:

-The devs abandoned this at the side of the road like an unwanted child.
- Might be a bit TOO challenging at times
- $9.99 is a bit steep of a tag for a game that was abandoned in alpha.

Summary:  Buy this game if you like space strategy games, and dear god, please don't buy it at full price, wait for a sale.",False
"As someone who never played the Early Access version of this game, I personally think it is great for what it is. The sprites are created beautifully, the planets feel alive, and the satisfaction of watching your home colony grow after mining for resources never gets tiring. Played Terarria a lot years ago but eventually got bored due to the world feeling ""lonely"". In this game, there are plenty of AI Sprites running about, albeit they don't do much unless they are hostile. Gameplay is diverse enough to not get bored, especially when you come across good armor, or weapons. Want to play as a planet hopping medievil knight/warlord? Done. Want to play as a Space Marine with the best high tech gear? Done. Want to play as a lowly farmer on a planet? You can do that. The game has a wide variety of things you can do, if you put your mind to it. It's a relaxing game, as I never found a planet that was extremely tough or overwhelming (missions can be hard if you jump into them with low gear). But it's just solid fun for the price it's at.  

If you never played the Early Access game, chances are you can jump into the game and enjoy what it has to offer.",True

After 2000 hours of gameplay, I cannot longer say that I recommend this game. 
The players in 2v2 /3v3/ 1v1 are almost always unballanced, the community is straight up cancer, and my biggest problem with this game is that for people who are playing with keyboard and mouse, they don't have the possibility to freelook. That's what a mouse if for. Not only for boost and jump but to look around as well. I might have had 40% more wins if I had this feature, but sadly Psyonix doesn't give a sh_t about keyboard players.

"I've noticed a few things in this game that aren't the most...wonderful of things such as aliens being unusually and dramatically pathetic when it comes to health. It's also true that marines are far to powerful for me to enjoy the game as BOTH teams, wether it's not fun dieing and losing all the time as aliens, or being marines and having absolutly no problem (espetially if you have a shotgun). Some of the physics on the wall stuff from the George (can't remember their name) is broken such as marines phasing through the walls you make, and even trying to toss your little bait that lures the little alien buggers just bounces off of the air for some reason (I tested this for 20 minutes...call that an overreaction if you thought I was wrong). Another bad thing about the marines on the negative side for them is that the exo-suit just sucks, It's damage is tiny (ironic how the basic gun is better), the health is small for a large and slow target. For something that's really fricking expensive (45 resources!!!), it's not even worth it, even the flame thrower more worth it's price thatn that. If you some how avoid all of that, you still won't enjoy the game. It's far to delacate and if you mess up one thing, your game could crash or have worse concicences (amazing spelling). The game doesn't have to much to do, all you do is join games where you destroy the enemy base. There's a commander who can do stuff like give weapons, heal people, place orders to do and build stuff, etc (you essentially engage RTS-ish mode). There are soldiers/units who can choose to be a commander (which not very many people do), they can earn resources that generate from generators and you can get better weapons, evolve to ""better"" creatures, get exo-suits (there's only two, dual miniguns and dual railgun...neither are very good, but are the same price), and tools like a repair tool and...that's the only tool.

"Any one of these reviews that calls this game negative is correct and justified. I had an amazing premise and potential which was totally squandered. But I would like everyone to know about two mods. 

First Blackbox. It smooths out almost all of the bugs in vanilla and makes the game stable as well as improving AI. Additionally they have a new version of it. Called Texas. They are actually reworking the code to improve game speed and stability. It used to slow down horribly... and I mean HORRIBLY within minutes (50-100 ticks). Now I am over 4500 ticks in and its still smooth running. This new mod is still beta, has the odd crash, but it is updated regularily. 

Second mod to look out for is Combo. It takes the bare bones content and multiplies it by a good factor of 5. At least. They are built to work together and combined turn this spoiled bastard child of a game into what it should have been. 

If you have it sitting in your library I recommend you try it with these mods. If you like 4x and are interested in seeing it in RTS with designable ships with tons of options give it a try. Even if it hurts to support a dev who abandoned it. Really wish the money would go to the new adoptive parents instead of the one who is working on his third failure.",True
"A VERY fun top-down Battle Royale. This is coming from a person who hates Battle Royale games. I absolutely love that without owning the full game, the only thing you loose is character customization. There is nothing you can buy that would give one player an advantage. I also recommend changing your super jump role keybind to right click, once you get used to it, it's a very nice change. 

On the topic of keybinds, I was able to figure out how to play the game very easily, and after one match I already knew what I was doing. 

The playerbase is pretty friendly, and it's very likely that you will join a game with devs and mods. I have 1.6h on the game and I have seen a mod in like 90% of the games I played. It's enter to chat, then tab to toggle team/public chat. Of course I'm muted for saying not nice things in chat so I can't really do that.

"if you dont understand milsim combat this should be your first game into it. it makes team play easy, and important. this game is basic enough for a battlefield player, but advanced enough for a real world veteran. matches are about 20 minutes long, longer based on how well each team is doing.

ive already made a few friends on the field, because of proximity chat, but equally, i have seen my men, and others, completely obliterated by mortars built by the enemy in some unknown land. i cried a lil. spent the rest of the game searching for these assholes. only to drop a few nades into their setup. destroying their respawn point, and saving the game from a definite loss.

the game is tense. if you want to play arma but feel like your gonna fall behind not knowing a lot, this game at the very least will tell you what itsall about. and even freely lets you gain a commanding role, which allows you to build mortar structures, respawn points, all through shipments of cars filled with the supplies needed.

you need a team. 9 man squads, 70 man matches, 9 sounds like a lot, but theres enough action to keep them busy shooting more than talking. some people dont even like to talk and only do so for your sake.

if you dont have a microphone for chat, your basically fucked. even the tutorial warns you. and they are right.  men have died in the little hours i have because they didnt respond or couldnt relay any sort of information. your team needs you. your squad needs you.

if you really dont know what milsim is, or want just a gameplay understanding of milsim, try out Planetside 2.  its a free to play so you wont be losing money. Squad is a real world version of that game. you create a squad, you take over a section of the map with them, you feel better. squads differences are its not in space, has real world physics, and you can build structures.

"The games a bit buggy. It's gotten much better, but it can still be an annoyance to wait a min or two to get back into where you were at after a crash. So the question is, does that impede the truly innovative experience found in the single player?

I love what M7 has done, working on a nuanced city mode system where total dominance is not the game, but stretch and reach to stay afloat and prosper.

It could be a LOT better in regards, but for how smart the mechanics are and the amount of thought and care already put into it I can tell you it's SUPER FUN regardless. I hope hope hope M7 will work on this more beyond bug fixing in the months to come, as like a Civ game on release, it just needs more tinkering to tune the machine just right.

Also an improved FS1 fighting experience (has a nicer flow to what was already a rich system), which is explored quite well in the single player mode.

Definitely get it if you want to take a chance on a super dense and refreshing single player, just be aware it's slightly wobbly both as software and the gameplay. Really isn't a dealbreaker at all for me, esp. with the progress made post-launch.

"Terraria is one of those games that you play for a really long time, and then play something else for a while. Afterwards, you get a craving to start a brand new world + character and get addicted all over again. Almost everything about it is absolutely amazing. It has a great difficulty, tons of amazing and super fun weapons, and on top of all of that, it even has a deadly flying shark that spawns tornados with even more miniature sized flying shark. What more can a guy ask for?? Well, maybe a Dinosaur that could breath fire and jump to the sky and then track your movement to instakill you. That'd be fun, other than the fact that it would suck. 

The point is, Terraria has many different random things, but they all work together to make a game that is very entertaining, and it doesn't take itself to serious. Other than fighting the Moon Lord. That one boss makes the game VERY serious. Seriously. The guy nearly gave me a sweaty forehead after seeing him spawn. Not to mention the worst of all, trying to fight the Eye of Cthulu with a short sword. That gave me nightmares. Actually, come to think of it I think that only was a nightmare. Yeah, I'd never do that. If you could though, that's even more impressive then beating every level on Super Meat Boy. Which I've done, fun fact. Never again though. Never again. 

This review is a dinglehop and a half, so go eat some rye christmas cookies, and sit by the canadian furnace and enjoy some terraria with your friends. Or not. You COULD just sit there and terrorize your friends by dropping a whole bunch of wooden swords at the world spawn point so as soon as they spawn their entire inventory is stuffed with swords. Yeah, I also did that. It was very fun. Too bad it costed me a friend, but hey that's a part of terraria. Angering your friends. Well, that isn't technically a feature, but rather for me it is a tool, and I just fine tuned it to specifically target my friends. This review is super long, but that goes to show how bored I am right now. Quarentine sucks. Terraria makes it all better. Buy it please. Or not. Either way, I have no friends now.",True

"Def needs patches, but from my time playing on PC (GTX 760ti & 8gb ram) and PS4 I HIGHLY recommend the game! Even if you don't want to deal with the issues on PC, get it on PS4 if you can! The Devs will fix the issues, they are a very small team working around the clock. This game will be fixed, and it will be great! If you've already purchased, give it a few days for patches, if you're thinking about buying it, give it a few days for patches. Lots of salt, understandably so, but a lot of people are also being unwilling to give it a little time. 

This is an exploration game, not full of action, but some action is still there, I agree with someone who said it's like a bigger, more casual Elite: Dangerous. 

*****THIS IS NOT A ""MULTIPLAYER GAME""***** while there is multiplayer components, it's not going to be a MMO or something you can meet up with buddies and play, expect a single player exp, and be pleasantly surprised by anything else.
Breakdown:
Pros:
Open world/open universe
15,000,000,000,000 full size planets to explore (real number, not just made up)
Tons of animals and plants to discover
Tons of equipment & ship options
Space
Lots of free content to come
Feels almost overwhelming

Cons:
Rough launch (Should be fixed, hopefully not another batman bust)
Gets slightly repetative
Feels almost overwhelming

Overall I give it a 9.5/10

"Grow Home is a relaxing game.  There are no guns, no stealth, no monsters.  You explore a series of floating islands in search of crystals and plants.  The crystals increase your jet pack so you can travel further.  The world is made up of polygons and personally I really enjoy the art direction.  A lot of the game is spent climbing hand over hand using the trigger buttons if you're using a controller.  You can climb in any direction, even hang by BUD's (the robot) hands.  A few words about BUD, he's clumsy and cute.  Don't expect to stop moving and turn on a dime.  The way he staggers about is amusing and I really enjoyed him as a character.  If you're looking for a nice game that doesn't take too long to complete, Grow Home is definitely worth checking out.

"[h1]HITMAN: BLOODMONEY[/h1]


(when im gonna spoil something youll just see ""__________"")

The first time i played ""Hitman: Blood Money"" was on the ps2... well i didnt paly it, but i watched my brother play it. i got  steam acount and in my first ""buy everything in the store and hope it's good"" phase i saw this old favorite sitting there. i didn't remember much because when i watched my brother play it i was about 7. so i decided ill give it a go. all i remebered was a casino, bird costumes, naked guys, drunk santa and guns. i recently finished the game and i have finally come to a conclusion. way back when i was 7, as i said i didn't remember much, but what i did remember, i remember it kicking ten tons of as. now that i can actually pass judgemnet (and count to three) i've found that memory doesnt fail me. at least not yet.

in the game you play as the kick as clone assassin ""AGENT 47"". you follow him as he is getting hunted down by ________. you travel around the globe to spain, to vegas, to venice, etc. you kill targets ranging from corrupt poloticians sons to other assassins. with trusty silverballers in hand you travel the globe to kill some high and mighty people. range of weapons and supply of gaurds alomst unlimited you can play the part of kill-crazed maniac to silent shadow. of cousre for me i have a secret motto. ""if at first you dont succeed in your mission, kill every thing that moves while all you can see is red due to anger and frustration towards the game."" in the game you and your fellow assassins with ""THE AGENCY"" are getting hunted and while still going for your regular contracts you have to keep your head down.

when it comes to overall performance lets keep a running total. to do this i give each game i review 10 points and then add and subtract them how i see fit. lets go.

10

the games over all physics engine and graphics are nice: +1
11

the game can get a little buggy and laggy at times: -.5
10.5

when you get killed, you have to wait like twenty for the whole screen to go red and 47 too start falling: -1
9.5

the use of lights to desguise yourself and your pray is well done, even for the system capabilities: +1.5
11

the ragdoll physics are a little outragious but it doesnt bother me too much, it gives me the capabilities to get some funny screen shots after posing them: +0, -0

FINAL PERFORMANCE SCORE: 11

i feel that the physics and peformance of the overall game, although a tad outdated now, are fine for when it came out. im not gonna be the guy who goes from skyrom to this and says  ""the graphics suck."" keep in mind the game is like 10 years old.

when it comes to gameplay I'd have to say that it was great for the time once agian. it had acomeplling story and it was incredible fun and i found myself laughing a few times at the things people said when they passed by 47.

all in all in have to say that it was a fantastic game. I give it about  ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼   ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼. ten out of ten (For those of you who dont want to count it out. i highly suggest it.",True

"I rarely buy games for full price on Steam, and even when I do it's usually just for titles under 15 bucks. I have a lot of history with the Crash Bandicoot series, mainly 2, 3 and CTR so I dove into this one without a second thought.

I have no regrets at all, it recaptures the old series perfectly with the visual and quality of life upgrades you'd expect along with some neat little additions too. Having not played the first Crash game it was nice to experience it the first time as a strong origin for the series, just a fantastic example of a challening timing based platformer which you don't see a lot of these days. It definitely is the most difficult of the three with it being focused on timing whereas CSB and Warped were more focused on giving Crash more stuff to do. CSB will forever be my favourite just because it's the purest Crash experience for me. Warped had a lot of fun in it, but it felt like they were running out of ideas for variety. I wasn't a fan of the underwater, motorbike or jet ski levels and the abilities let you circumvent a lot of the game's challenges.

Either way anyone with nostalgia for Crash will love this remake.",True
"It's quirky... but I love it. Story line is a bit dull - but you have to take in to account it's age... and it really doesn't reflect MP gameplay. This is where my heart lies with the game. 

Honestly, it's still my favorite out of the series. It beats having to deal with GFWL that LPEC:Colonies has to deal with, even though Colonies definitely has more of a player base. This one seems to be more PC and user friendly.

This version does have a rather small active online player base... but it's not filled with overpowered weapons - like colonies - and seems to have more of a precision aspect to it. I still play both... for they both have their ups and downs... where one lacks the other picks up.

"Game is fun when you're a new player, but as you rank up it gets a-lot more frustrating. The game in its current state is overall unbalanced and bloated with a-lot of perks that ""fix"" an issue stemming from the core mechanics of the game. Basically what I mean is that the devs tend to put a bandage over a wound by creating new/barely used perks instead of going in and fixing the issue itself; now the game has a stupid amount of perks that are never used which correlates with the absurd and tedious grind, un-fun strict meta, and resting feeling of ""this could be great but it isn't"". 

If there was another game in the asym multiplayer slasher genre that had a stable player-base and dev-support then I would 100% be playing that over this, and I feel like that goes for a-lot of existing players currently playing Dead By Daylight.

"Before I bought ATS I wasn't interested in trucks or trucking at all. I picked this game up on sale at $5, and now I own all the non-paintjob DLCs and I'm writing my 60 hour review. If you enjoy driving in real life, you'll probably enjoy ATS. It's probably the best driving simulator I've ever played, though some of the on-ramps and off-ramps are way shorter than they'd be in real life. The game is best played with a controller or wheel. I wouldn't recommend just using a keyboard and mouse. There's a good amount of workshop content that really adds to the game. For instance, I drive an FLB with an Optimus Prime skin, all of which came from the workshop. This isn't my favorite game, but it's one I go to when I want to do some driving or tinker around with customizing my truck. And it's really satisfying once you figure out how to back the trailer into a loading bay without leaving first-person view! If you're still unsure, wait for sale and give it a try like I did.

I'm gonna be honest I thought it was inspired by a book and my first thought was ""Wait I gotta pause this and google who the author is then I'm gonna buy the novel. Period"". Props to the mind who gave birth to the story.
I'm not gonna complain because the game hasn't been translated in my native language as someone did: there's everything you need to know about the game on its Steam page so you know what you're buying. You don't know english? Your fault, I don't see why the creators should suffer for your ignorance. You want it translated? Ask for it. Wait for it. 
Nice music, really enjoyed the voiceover.
The game is really easy, you can't go wrong.
Only thing is: it's not worth the price. It's a great story but it's too short and leaves you questioning some stuff (that, as I read, should probably get cleared in the next longer game) so buy it when on sale because for the full price you could buy hours of good reading.",True

The combat is horrible, in every way.  This isn't a case of ""git gud"", it's legitimately god awful.  Blocking does nothing, at all.  So called ""master blocks"" might block the first hit in a string of combo attacks an npc unleashes on you, maybe.  More than likely not though.  Meanwhile their defenses are practically flawless unless you manage to get into a clinch and win, then you might be able to get in a free shot, if you didn't shove them 10 feet backwards out of range.  Surviving a fight against a single foe requires you to soak as much damage using your armor (and by association, your stamina bar) as possible until they exhaust themselves, before you start taking health damage and die.  

Eventually (assuming you don't give up on the game) you'll level up and learn ""combos"".  None of which work, because they require the NPC you happen to be fighting to not block or dodge a single attack.  Which in my 80 hours happened 3 times. Yup.  Woo.  Combos.  

The targetting system is, without a doubt, the WORST I have ever encountered.  You ""lock on"" to an opponent in combat in one of 2 ways.  First there's this weird passive lock-on when you look at someone you're in combat with.  The 2nd is an actual lock you manually turn on or off.  The manual lock is fine, the ""passive"" one though, is totally broken.  You have to practically fling your mouse halfway across your room to get it to unlock from a target.  This makes disengaging (in a game that requires you to run like a bitch every other fight) extremely difficult.  

Combat against more than 1 opponent with anything less than full plate armor with full chainmail underneath of it will end with you dying in about 3 hits, so basically you have to run like a bitch.  You may think this is realistic, in theory I suppose it is, but a fully armored and armed knight (on horseback no less) having to run away from 2 guys armed with wood splitting axes is ridiculous and not at all fun.  

Speaking of being on horseback, don't bother fighting on your horse.  First, you can't hit anything, even if it's right next to you.  Second, you can't outrun NPCs on foot using anything less than a full gallop.  Third, your horse / the MC can't steer or ride very well, at all.  Fourth, the NPCs apparently have unlimited sprinting and can unhorse you, without fail, whenever they get next to you.  Again, the game isn't even remotely realistic here.  A fully armored knight being yanked out of his saddle (while moving and in combat I might add) by some practically naked bandit is the height of stupidity.  Mounted archery fairs a little better out in the open (like in a field), assuming you don't mind galloping 200 feet away and having enough time to loose exactly one arrow in their general direction before the NPCs are right back in your face.  As for actually hitting something, well, that's kind of up in the air, pun not intended.  

Speaking of archery, the game has an active miss system, in that if you center your non-existent (but replacable via mod) crosshair over something the game considers a target, like an NPC, or an archery target, or a bunny, the crosshairs will drift left or right off of it and not go back.  It's like trying to get 2 magnets with similar polarities next to each other, it just doesn't work.  At higher archery levels this seems to turn off, but it's a damn stupid way of making archery hard at lower levels.  Either way, just like the rest of combat, it sucks. 

The game has bugs galore.  Quest bugs, combat bugs, dialogue and sound bugs, you name it, it's got them.  The graphics aren't horrilble, except for the character textures.  Even on a GeForce 1080ti it looks like everyone is made out of playdough and none of them have eyebrows.  Textures clip into each other too, so wearing anything except one layer of armor has all kinds of visual problems.  

The main character spazes out and flails his hands around like a retard during practrically every dialogue sequence. 

The save system is probably the worst I've ever seen.  You'll need a mod for it.

The ending is both sudden, and stupid.  It's obvious they want you to buy 4 DLCs.

I could go on, but I'm too tired to even bother.  Avoid this POS and pick up Skyrim or The Witcher 3 or Mount and Blade or something.  Seriously.  If the stupid prologue hadn't taken me 6 hours to complete because it's entirely based on some bullshit RNG system to avoid being shot to death while running away I would have refunded this POS, but I made the mistake of assuming it MIGHT get better.  After forcing myself to complete it (having to restart apparently 3/4 of the way through because of a bug and loss of all my saves) I logged in like 80 hours or something.  Let me assure you, it doesn't get better, it still sucks, and I've now uninstalled it, never to play it again.",False

"I tried and hoped to like this game. 

Do NOT buy this game if you have less than 3 people in your group. You will not be able to survive very long. There are absolutely NO friendly players what so ever. I played about 20 total hours (on different accounts) and did not kill another player, tried to be the most positive and non-KOSable player out there... to no avail. The game isn't optimized particularly well, but still runs fairly smooth. The combat is a little glitchy (range/hitbox can feel really dirty). 

Rust adds some very cool aspects to survival games. Very interesting building and crafting abilities... But the community and combat and Lack of PvE/non-combat based gameplay is pretty lacking. 
If you want to suceed in Rust, play with friends and ONLY use resources to build weapon/armor until you've killed a lot of players and taken their stuff to build a base.

I wish I could recommend this game honestly, but the community aspect just makes it simply no-fun. An hour of work gone in a minute, 5 hours gone in 30 seconds...",False

"I believe Final Fantasy 9 is one of the best Final Fantasy games. It is lighthearted in appearance, but don't let that fool you - the issues explored in this game are very, very dark, including war and genocide.

The game world is a mixture of fantasy and steampunk (there is a LOT of steam, mist, and clouds in this game; probably why it was released on this platform!). The game's backgrounds are gorgeous and colourful (I took many screenshots) and most of them are partly animated, breathing life into every location you visit. The whole game looks and feels like you're walking through a Miyazaki movie.

The main characters are a whimsical collection of misfits that range from magical children to brooding warriors. The plot is your straightforward ""save the world from a warlord"" fare, with the usual twists and turns of betrayal and friendship. The ending of the game felt rushed and disjointed, with so many events and so much information dumped on the player that it felt like a completely different story.

The music is, as expected, fabulous. It captures a medieval tone and sentiment, like the lute music of Shakespeare's time. The soundtrack alone is a work of art.

As for gameplay, you have options. Hardcore gamers can grind, sidequest, and level up to their heart's content. A big sidequest is evolving your chocobo to hunt for treasure. Casual gamers, or nostalgic gamers who just want the story, can simply activate this PC version's Boosters to transform this JRPG into a graphic novel. I appreciate this freedom of choice.

Final Fantasy 9 is a pleasant retro departure from the modern Final Fantasy.",True

"As of writing this I've played the game for about an hour. Even so, if it were removed from my games library and I could never play it again, my money was still well spent, especially since I got it on sale for a dollar.

As you can tell from the trailer, the concept is that you descend a well with a pair of gunboots, using them to hover briefly and plan your next move as you shoot, and goomba stomp your way down. The game is extremely fast paced, and there is never a dull moment. Maneuvering around and shooting unstompable enemies while scouting for the next place to recharge your boots without dropping your combo is an incredibly satisfying, and rewarding game flow to get good at. You're efforts are then rewarded with gems, which act as your score, and are used in shops to buy items.

Though it is fast paced, I never felt there was a moment that was unfair. If you manage the charge on your gunboots well, and keep your eyes glued to the bottom of your screen, things are always reactable, and there is a way through without taking damage.

There is a fair amount of content beyond the main gameplay loop to unlock as well. You can play in different ""styles"" which slightly modify your character, or the things you find in the well, and can unlock different color palettes to change up the visuals if you wish. There is also a ""new game plus"" of sorts, but it doesn't change a ton.

I have only 3 compaints, all of which are pretty nitpicky, the first being the small amount of items. 

In my hour of playtime I've seen every item, and every gun module, but given the price of the game, this may not be something worth considering as a negative. 

Secondly, there are some expected options missing in settings. You can't rebind controls, now, given that there's only movement, and one button, it will likely not be an issue, but it's still something that's expected of any game on pc. There is also no specific sound options, only a toggle for the background music, and a master volume.

Finally, the simple visuals help with reactions, which I'll discuss a bit more later, but there are cases where the color coding can mislead you. Generally red will hurt and white will not, but, for example, torches on the well are slightly red, yet don't hurt to bounce on.

If you're someone who is well practiced in difficult video games, especially platformers, you may beat the game rather quickly. Like I said, I've only played for an hour, but in my first attempt I nearly beat the game, and in my second I did, and though it may seem like pointless bragging, I bring this up for a reason: If you are A) good at platformers B) the kind of person to beat a game and never play it again, and C) looking for a game to play for a good while, you may want to skip this one, or get it on sale. 

I will argue though, it took me an hour to beat the game, meaning $3 = 1 hour. Using that ratio, $60 = 20 hours, so in my opinion the price is fair even if you beat it quick, and stop playing.

However if you're someone who's not practiced in difficult games, the fast pace may make the game too difficult to enjoy. I say you have to be at least moderately skilled to have a positive experience with it.

Visually, I find the design appealing, but I can see why someone would want more. It is very simplistic, with just enough color to denote what is what. Red will hurt you, white will not. For a game as fast paced as this, I think going simple was a good choice. It facilitates accurate, split second decisions on the players part, and reduces the chance of having a moment where you get hit because you thought one thing was something else. As I mentioned, there are situations where the color coding is misleading, but personally I had very little problems.

Musically, the game has a great ost that fits the style of the game and it's areas. 

Sound design is also done very well, with the sound of your gunboots shooting, things exploding, and picking up gems all being very satisfying additions that make the action on screen feel more powerful.

SUMMARY:
PROS:
- Fast paced, and fair gameplay.
- Amazing mechanics that are extremely rewarding to improve at, and master.
- Good amount of content for the price.
- Color coded visuals help with fast reactions.
- Great OST and sound design.

CONS:
- I personally think the amount of content is satisfactory, but if you're someone who isn't pleased by slight gameplay changes, you may think otherwise.
- If you're skilled at fast paced platformers, looking for a game that will last you a while, and tend to shelf games as soon as you beat them, this might not be for you.
- Fast pace may cause frustration for those who don't play difficult games often.
- Obviously not for you if you don't like simplistic visuals.
- Color coding is ambiguous in a few spots.
- No control binding, and limited sound options.",True

"Well, this was actually a pretty good game. It has a strong strategic and tactical take (think rock-paper-scissors-Spock-lizard with a few units having abilities that can crush those who are supposed to beat them some of the time), not particularly ""lanes"" like some have said after the first couple missions. The plot is original as far as I know:  [spoiler] Expedition funded to investigate growing nebula and previous fleet, finds aliens who attack on sight but turn out to be clones of more peaceful Scythe who have been themselves attacked and experimented upon by the large group/corporation that funded both expeditions in the first place , who then try to kill the second expedition.

"What can i say about this game that hasn't already been said.

First off i can say that the game is very fun! I had a very enjoyable time playing it and its a simple action game similar in style to Dark Souls. This game features a very nice style choice, having everything be low poly models, while still having impressive looking lighting to make the world stand out better. But the biggest most glaring flaw of this game, is that it lacks POLISH.

Ill explain what i mean. The animations dont blend together smoothly, in fact they dont at all. If you use a light attack and roll as soon as you can it looks very stiff instead of it being fluid. Another thing i noticed is that enemies will spawn randomly around you. Or at least thats what it seems, there are enemy types called screamers that MAY OR MAY NOT spawn enemies when they scream, and they scream when they notice you and attack you. And that can spawn more enemies that scream and spawn more. But i do not know for sure if they spawn enemies at all! In fact they might just spawn completely randomly around you while you fight, which can easily overwhelm you until you spend your stamina to use a charge attack. I am unsure if there is any way in-game to figure out what enemy is what, because at the start you get several ""quests"" to slay specific enemy types, but i've never been able to actually complete one despite killing everything i came across. But i suppose that may be nitpicking, maybe i haven't encountered the enemies in question yet. Other than that, another nitpick i suppose i could point out is that the gear you find does not show you statistics on that peice of gear. Its only the item name, description, and what tier the weapon is. I wish it gave specific or approximate weapon damage numbers, but it unfortunately does not, and you can only hold two weapons at any time. 
One last thing i noticed is that everything is very grey. But its not just the color that bothers me, since its supposed to be a dark stone dungeon, HOWEVER. I noticed that its just, untextured completely. If you model anything in any modeling software and do not texture it, its just a solid grey color. And thats very disapointing. I feel like this game would be improved vastly with the addition of proper texture work and enemy AI.

"Hybrid of a Roguelike and Metroidvania game, considering I love both those genres I think this is great. 

Artstyle is stunning, Combat is fine and gameplay loop of exploring, levelling, dying and feeling like it can all go wrong any minute is what makes this game great.

I actually love the way death is handled because it eradicates alot of the backtracking classic metroidvania's force on you which I find can get dull.

"It's cute but for full price no. While I liked the game I only got 2.8h out of the playtime and that's picking the ending choice to talk to every individual character and going through all choices. There aren't that many choices. The main story seems completely unaffected by those choices and things just go through very linearly. The only thing a choice does is either gets you some CGs or not. And I'm not sure how that works without the 18+ patch you have to go find off steam. Exception is the last choice which is just to talk to one of four characters. I even sat through the credits each time so that padded out the runtime.

They should update the game with some 18+ DLC so it doesn't have to be done through other avenues given Steam allows such things. [and even with the patch it's still mosaic censored]. I'm not sure what the choices do, in the steam version without the offsite patch.

The backgrounds are really distracting since they're edited photos of real life and you can see blurred out people in them when this is a furry story. So it's weird to imagine humans walking around lol. But the actual art is really nice. Music is never annoying, but nothing special.

And all of this on brand new Unreal 4 engine that looks great but even this did not save this mess.
Even the developer don't know what this game suppose to be - it started as a simple shooter, then he re-done all of it adding spells, then again changed it to be third person shooter, to finally revert it back to previous state but with horror vibe to it. Yes what a wild ride.

I actually tried to help the developer with some other gamers giving him tips and ideas - as much as I was surprised he went out and tried to apply them. End result was even more mind boggling glitches and bugs. 
My dad told me once - do it properly or don't do it at all. Panzer Gaming Studios	 should just stop.

"Nice little shooter with ridiculous number of upgrades and gigantic pixelated explosions. Unfortunately, the game (at least the Linux version) is marred by bug that makes longer gaming sessions impossible. Simply put, when you get good enough not to get killed in the first few minutes, you'll discover that the game ALWAYS crashes when the action gets hectic after 20-30 minutes of playtime. ALWAYS. This has been confirmed by several Linux users, the developers were made aware of this but there is no reaction at all from them and the bug is not fixed after several months, not even in the beta version.",False

"Great game, would recommend.",True
"Before I go rave about how amazing this game is let me explain the gameplay (poorly, I'm not good at explaining) a bit.
Instead of you hunting down the monsters you instead ""Let Them Come"" to you, and mow them down. You start off with facing two enemy types, but new types quickly get added and the game turns into this chaotic cacophony of explosions as you shoot, melee, throw grenade and switch ammo type on instinct.
Now for whats good about this game
Holy moly! Okay so this game is basically perfect in every way. The artstyle? Superb pixel art with lots of gore! The gameplay? While it may not look like much at the start it gets super hectic and fun when everything just clicks on you go on this huge multi-wave killing streak and you get tons of combo meters which means you get power ups which (if you play your cards right) means you fill it up even faster! (Plus theres enemies which explode so you get to see blood, guts, weird purple liquid and stuff go flying!). The music is superb! Like it is a total banger through and through. This isn't just a game it's the best experience you can get for less than 10$ and one of the best things period!

Now sadly the campaign is a bit on the short side and the story is a bit generic, with most of it coming in the form of notes which are easy to miss on the inventory menu. But hey! You got New Game+, Rampage mode, Challenge mode (where you fight all the bosses) and this cool looking mode (which I havent been able to try out) where you link with your twitch account and your viewers can participate (I don't know how it works as I haven't done it).",True

"This game is another masterpiece by the minds that brought you FTL. Plain and simple.

Imagine a choose your own adventure Pacific Rim esque scenario. Involved with this is the marriage of Advanced Wars style tactics bred with Final Fantasy tactics (both gameboy advanced/DS titles). Imagine now if you would that the greuling RNG of XCOM or Fire Emblem is not the reason for your own defeat, but the only person you can hate is yourself for screwing up. This game is a fast paced onslaught of tactical mastery where crushing your opponents does not always translate to victory, but a healthy balance of choosing your fights well, keeping your own resources/team open ended, making tough often sacrificial choices and saving civilians has an amazing concept that will challange any tactical junkie. 

The game play is simple. You choose your own team of 3 mechs and save humanity against a race of giant vermin. You collect pilots that have thier own unique traits, they level up, you collect weapons throughout the game to switch out on your mechs, you gain experience orbs to spend on talents for your mechs, and the number one goal is to keep humanities casualities as low as possible while taking calculated risks to chase loot. There are four islands at first to choose from, and you get to choose which route you want to go every step of the way. A fifth final island with the final mission can complete the game at anytime, but beware. It can be like taking on Lavos too early and facing a wipe in Chrono Trigger. 

The enemies are not huge in variety, but its not really needed. They will always move first and declare exactly where they are attacking or what abilities they are using: its your job to prevent these attacks from doing as much harm as possible and to hold out for 5 turns per skirmish, sounds simple enough right?...wrong. Your foe is clever, bruttish, and ravenous for as much chaos as possible. I would reccomend easy mode to get started as the creators of FTL so far have not been known to show mercy in either title. These vermin will use a variety of different weapons, elements, terrain features, etc. just like you would. Completing mission objectives rather than just surviving will give you extra incentive to use the map and your mechs abilities to the furthest so you can make them even stronger (imagine Chroma Squad). Knock the vermin into water, earthquakes, lightning storms, acid vats, mines, ice, satelite launches, mountains, burning forrests, each other, yourself, and even reposition them to attack each other! You can stand on or even knock enemies into spawning tiles to prevent them from showing up for a turn and cause damage to the unit on the tile, but be careful! The last thing you want is to block everything off then on turn three have a passive swarm of 5-8 vermin showing up at once against your 3 mechs :). 

The soundtrack is catchy and I even went out of my way to download it. The variety of the mechs you choose at first is limited to just one team, but completing in game achievements will grant you currency to unlock several more squads of 3 including ones that use judo to make enemies hit each other, ones that shoot flames, drop stones on the field creating obstructions, deal damage to themselves to increase damage output, use lightning whips, freeze enemies with a canon, etc. etc. etc!

I personally love this game more than FTL. Its worth the price tag for anyone even half interested in my description and should be a grab for anyone even at full price. 9/10.

Well time to go. I have some bastard scorpions to throw over my head to smash into mountains, and hornets to freeze into submission with my mech zords to save humanity!",True

"Brilliant game, always getting new updates and improvements. fast paced pvp which takes time to master.
This is a 5* game. But i DO NOT recommend it simply because there is no community at all. 99% of all players you meet are absolutely toxic and will kill you even if they have little to no gain from doing so. The hardest thing about this game is starting a base. often it will take you hours to build even the smallest of bases because you will continuously die from groups and clans having such a massive advantage. sometimes, you will find a quiet area and gather enough materials to go all out and start off with a 4x4 base! you craft yourself a building plan and tool hammer, your tool cupboard, door and lock are ready too.. and a wolf comes out of absolutely nowhere, running faster than the speed of sound and anally rapes your before you get a chance to get to safety. 

 Solo play on this game is next to impossible. well, i say impossible.. it is possible, but it's almost impossible to have fun. You will get jumped by groups of players that have far superior weapons simply because they can gather so much faster.

Yeah i get it, it's supposed to be a survival game.. but if the zombie apocalypse comes, and every undead AND living cunt you see is out to kill you, there's no chance of survival for anyone.

"Superb indie rogue-like that is well balanced, allows steady progression after death, has decent random mechanics and a proper dungeon exploring feel.  Runs generally last between 15 minutes and... well, maybe 45 minutes? Depends how good you are.  But each run isn't a complete reset - you have upgrade shops on the home screen, so you can get better for each run.

Ignore the screenshots, they won't tell you how this game plays. It's fun, it's clever, and you'll enjoy getting absorbed in a world of tactics.. Want to play as warrior, rogue. mage, duel-wielder, combo of something inbetween? Yes you can. But you'll need to collect the right gear and pray to the right gods. Progression works really well - when you die, you keep some stuff from the previous runs, so you constantly improve and get further.

I really wish I'd noticed this game sooner. It's excellent, one of the best rogue-like games in an indie market saturated by average stuff.  This is finely balanced, progressive and challenging in a fun way. Buy it, if you like dungeon crawling roguelikes.",True

"Rainbow Six Siege is a 5v5 multiplayer shooter that focuses on squad based tactics  in an attacker/defender style. R6S is a fun enough game, save for the fact that the game is a hot mess at the moment. Bugs out the whazoo such as graphical and audio glitches that make the game unplayable until you restart and atrociously emberassingly awful hitboxes would be naming a few of the cons of this game. The gameplay is fun enough, and it is unique in terms of how it delivers the FPS experience. I just don't think the novelty of being able to blow holes in walls is enough to make up for the many shortcomings the game has. And again, the hitboxes in this game basically turn it into a game of chance, not a game of skill, which is to say that the game is mostly broken in terms of the shooting. Well isn't the game a first person SHOOTER... you might ask? Well yes, yes it is. However, the shooting is mostly luck based at the moment and has almost nothing to do with the skill of the players competing against each other. Simply watching a match on Twitch will demonstrate that players need only shoot in the general direction or get their bullets ""close enough"" to the player in order to receive kills. Also, headshots in this game are way, way too high of a percentage compared to normal body shot kills. You will notice almost immediately that over half the kills are the results of headshots. Sometimes, it's from people poking around corners and the head is the only visible part, I will grant that. Most of the time, however, it is because, once again, the game's hitboxes are completely screwed right now. R6S is a fun game, in theory, and delivers a pretty unique FPS experience. They have a good formula here that, I feel, was executed like complete and utter shite. Hopefully they will clean t his game up soon but, in it's current state, I feel that only the heartiest Rainbow Six franchise fans could recommend this game. Unfortunatley, it's made by Ubi Soft... so it's never going to get fixed... a shame, really. 

TL;DR - Rainbow Six Siege is a fun, fast paced FPS that delivers an attack/defence style of gameplay in a unique and varied way by introducing destructible walls. However, the amount of bugs, glitches, terrible hitboxes, and general poor design of the FPS experience keeps this game from being worth the $59.99. Save your money, buy Fallout 4 if you haven't already, or donate that 60 bucks to your local Salvation Army or charity of your choice. I cannot possibly recommend this game in it's current state.

Edit: I have played around 20 hours more since writing this review. I am more convinced then ever this game is not worth most peoples time. If you are looking for a good Rainbow Six game it's time to  go replay Vegas 2 or one of the originals. This game is Call of Duty : Siege. If that's what you're looking for by all means have at it. But for Rainbow Six fans, this game is an absolute bust and horrifying dissapointment.",False

Hoestly this game is a great game but i dont understand why hey have this abhorrent priceing like the creation club is its own thing and ya its stupid but its atleast to the side but what really ticks me off is how they price the base game at 30$ but keep the dlc at 60$ i have the base game and i think its well worth 60 dollers but the dlc only seems to be worth 15-25 for all of it but their priceing for 60 i dont understand if somehow bethesda is going bankrupt or something becuase this is rediculus for example both the expansion dlcs are worth nearly exactly the same as just buying the season pass so you cant just skip out on the rest of them and pay less you have to buy it all and like arggggg but aside from who ever is running that part of betheseda this is actually a great game. Theve totally steped up the gunplay and the melee system is like right there from being good it feels better but their are still some problems with it and i wish they had more work moddding to offer for them but its a huige step in the right direction but anyhow the one thing that mostly makes people dislike this game is the fact that your not truly your own charecter your just following nicks or whats her names story (same thing either way) and to be honest its neat and unquie but lets leave it as fallout 4 who did that almost everyone who plays this would rather play as themselves not as nick or uh you know but anyhow this game really shouldent be bashed as bad as it is it truly is a good game... even if they are being a tad over priced,True

"So if you've grown up on games like Pharoah and Cleopatra from way back when, then you will definetly (not sure exactly though) enjoy spending countless hours of playing, having fun, then ultimately regreting having spent valuable time on a video game instead of on something else in life that can be considered productive. Of course if you consider productive being the act of learning how to manage a nation of varying cultural backgrounds, histories, and in turn how to change history then this game is for you!   

[THE GOOD]  
  
You can develop your civilizations towards whatever path (within the confines of the game rules) you want. Want to be peaceful? Go right ahead. Warmonger? Not the best option but its your choice as well. You have that kind of freedom in this game.
  
 
You ultimately end up wanting to expand and grow your civilization and enjoy seeing it grow as time progresses. The fun arrives in what type of strategy you should take in terms of what technology you should research. It becomes a game of balancing the need for research to improve how much money you can make, the military strength you can get, the rate at which you can build things, and the means of which you can get more culture, research, happiness and faith for your people.

The visuals are also impressive and each unit also changes their appearances as you progress in the game's time. 

[THE BAD]
Micro managing can be very annoying in this game, especially when you're at war with another nation in the game. You don't have the option of dragging the mouse over several military units at the same time and then tell them where to go. Instead, you have to go through countless units at your disposal and give each and every one of them a command as to where they should go. In those case you just end up telling your units to go whereever just to save time, but in doing so you can send them to a place which you may end up regretting later.   
  
I also wish there was a way to have nations and city states merge with yours through peaceful means instead of just conquest being the option. Of course there is a civ which has the ability to merge city states peacefully with their own, but I was hoping for something like that being available for all civs.

It never felt repetitive - I'd honestly be happy to explore it even more. It was clearly made with a lot of love, there are many happy surprises. Sometimes you're amazed by the views, sometimes you're laughing at the subtle jokes, sometimes you're terrified at the sounds and the monsters nearby. Driving the vehicles is one of the most interesting experiences I've ever had in a game, it's honestly scary at the beggining, like the real thing. It has very little in common in terms of ambient and mechanics, but it reminded me a lot of how I felt playing Freelancer some 15 years ago.

"Difficulty setting : Hard mode
Time played : 20 hours (on Steam, because of Photo mode), 15/16hours ingame. 100% Completion (altough I missed some Elite mobs)

Shadow Warrior 2 is refreshing while still going for an oldschool gameplay. This is a fast FPS mixed with Diablo. A Borderlands on drugs, without the boring side. You have plenty of quests to keep you entertained, and the game has a huge replayability since you can use your finished save to go on NG+ and even change the difficulty setting.

Actually, you have : Easy, Normal, Hard, Insane, Insane 2 to 4.

Since the game can also be played in coop, you also can adjust the difficulty with the amount of players you'll have in your game.

Example :

Insane 4 =/= Insane 4 +4 players difficulty.

Also, be sure to have taste for this kind of game because since it's like Diablo, Elite monsters can be a little too bullet spongey if you're playing a very high difficulty and you don't have enough DPS on your weapons.

Speaking of weapons, I've found 50+ weapons in the game (there are 70+ weapons) and they all have their unique skin and personality, especially when you're doing your backward special attack with a melee weapon. the effect won't be the same between a Katana, circle blades or claws, for example.


Graphically it's very good, like really beautiful and you have a good set of options to tweak if you want the smoothest experience ever. The game is somewhat good optimized although it could be better. I noticed a lot of framedrops because of elite corpses on the ground, although the game was running fine when said elite was ALIVE and moving.

In conclusion, the game was really fun to play, and I'll go for my NG+ Insane run, waiting for the coop to be fixed (the host has a saved progression while coop guys don't, i don't know why, but you can lose your loots if it's not loot from your save).

Still, Lo Wang is a funny character and Shadow Warrior 2 is a real improvement after the 2013 version. It's brainless, lots of bloody fun, tons of weapons and customization (with gems), it has a good soundtrack, the jokes are cheesy and funny. Grab it if you're interested!

Very disappointing, compared to the movies.

Graviteam Tactics was made by like 10 guys somewhere in Ukraine, it can't possibly be good, right?
You're wrong. You're dead wrong.

First time I played it I was like that kid crying in the mall because he can't find his mom. I didn't understand this game at all. I thought it's not my jam. But then I watched some youtube vids of it and fooled around with custom battles and I was like dayum... this [u]IS[/u] my jam! This game indeed has some learning curve but it's not as steep as some people say. Tutorial that comes with the game can be thrown outta window immidiately as it is more confusing than helpful. Instead you can start by reading [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=339318454] THIS [/url] awesome guide, watching youtube vids of it and of course [u]playing[/u] as it's the best way to learn. Don't be afraid to lose battles and campaigns as sometimes defeat can teach you more than victory (and sometimes you can dominate the enemy but the game will mark campaign result as defeat because the scoring system in this game uses algorhythms more complicated than those used by NASA to control trajectory of space shuttles). 

There are multitudes of folks who play games like Europa Universalis or Hearts of Iron which are far more complicated. If you aren't a result of generations of inbreeding then I can't see how could this game be [i]too hard[/i] for you.

Graviteam Tactics' campaigns have 2 modes: strategical and tactical.

Strategical mode is kinda like a game of chess where you move icons representing platoons on the map. This turn based mode allows you to overall manage your army, add reserve troops to your existing platoons, send squads that lost their combat effectiveness to the rear, etc.

Tactical mode is the crème de la crème of the game. This is what dreams are made of. In this mode you get to command your guys on the battlefield. This game is sort of a commander simulator. This means that you only pass your orders down onto your men who then execute them in a way they see is best fitting. Sometimes they won't take a route you'd want them to, pick wrong targets or simply not execute your orders at all. Micromanagement is not only unneeded but is punished as soldiers may take so many orders before they get confused and end up not executing eny of them. Their performance depends on variety of factors like quality of squad leaders (or lack of them), morale, and so on. This aims to represent how unpredictable the real war is and how often commanders need to change their plans because some of their guys fucкed things up. Sometimes losses are unavoidable.

Game is visually pleasing. Not great but pretty good. Maps are huge and really beautiful. Tracer fire in the night looks absolutely stunning. Tank combat is where this game excels at. Graviteam, having previous experience making tank simulators, developed a great ballistic system. You can see enter and exit holes on vehicles, different velocity and trajectory for different types of ammunition, shells bouncing off the armor, etc. Add to that the enormous ranges, realistically behaving tracks and suspension and you end up with best tank combat ever shown in an RTS game.

Base game offers a few campaigns but then there are the DLCs which, in my opinion, are worth buying. Especially considering that 3 of them are post WWII which makes them particularily interesting.

Now I know what you guys are saying [i]""Dawg this is some weird-a$$ game lemme just stick to muh Company of Heroes shieeeet""[/i]

"Do you feel lucky?  You need to be to beat this game.  Skill?  Not so much.  Planning?  Nope.  Luck?  You need it...in batch lots.

This game would be fun if not for that.

This review is for the final released version.

You start out with 2 heroes.  Eventually you recruit 4.  And then they either die, or your power crystal explodes.

For example, on the Very Easy setting and 12 floors:
Game 1.  Made it to the 6th floor, fully equipped, lots of dust, attack mods, 4 heroes, and all of them were one hit KOs
Game 2.  7th floor, 4 heroes, wore down by wave after wave of mobs.
Game 3.  4 heroes, very little dust found, lots of unpowered rooms, overwhelmed.
Game 4.  Floor 7 again, one hit KOs again.
Game 5.  Lots of waves again
Game 6.  Floor 10...I see a glimmer in site...high level, fully equipped heroes...very little dust, so only 3 rooms of around 8 powered...and the mobs ONLY attacked my crystal, room after room after room.  Crystal exploded, costing me the game.

Don't ask about the easy setting...it is a lie.

You get the trend?  Thing is, this would be a fantastic game if it were more winnable.  Good exploration, lots of different mobs, random items and characters...I enjoyed it.  Right until I died.  Even after the first couple of deaths I enjoyed it.  And then I realized...I was just banging my head against the wall.  It didn't matter what I did, what strategies I used, how I planned my paths...I might as well be flipping a coin.",False

With a foundation of playing Factorio, this game is an enormously fun 3D upgrade to it. If you like building automated factories and resource management, definitely get this game.

"It took watching the show reluctantly to care about this game
The show drew me in and I fell in love with it
I bought this game well before watching the show, tried it and felt a little overwhelmed. I had already tried to start from the first Witcher to really get a sense of the story, but found the gameplay dated and I didn't care about the characters like I do now. I'll certainly be making a second attempt now and will be committing to purchasing the second Witcher too. Or at least will be finding a decent let's play series...

Anyway, it's jaw-droppingly beautiful. I can't help but find myself taking more screenshots of this game than I do real sunsets. 
The cutscenes are a little stilted, but they're mostly short and sweet. 
My favourite thing to do is find all the unmarked locations and collect things. I never felt like an adventurer like this before. Forget a Skyrim. The Witcher made the better knee joke anyway. 
Gwent is surprisingly fun. 
Horse riding is a little iffy when it comes to the auto sprint on roads but it's a nice feature anyway. 

Just a good time. Slay a beast, find some diagrams, make cool armor, repeat, find Ciri a little.. Yen's there, things from the show are referenced, and it really fleshes out the world from the show a lot for me. I consider this art, and the show and this game compliment each other so nicely.",True

"[h1]A nice heartfelt exercise in frustration.[/h1]

I really enjoyed it! Not as much as Brothers, but I can justify its length and price tag from where I live. Game looks nice and unique, reminiscent of an oil canvas painting, and I'm willing to forgive it for its inconsistent DOF, dropping framerates and blocky shadows. Music is appropriately subtle and not having intelligible dialogue does great for the visual storytelling. It's still pretty fun to wander around and interact with things just as it was with Brothers, though you do run out of stuff to explore as the story takes place in roughly the same few areas with but a few differences.

The groundhog day scenario did start to bother me as a large part of the middle section involves doing some things several times over and not being able to skip cutscenes. The game also breaks a few rules of cause and effect in favor of the story, but I'm willing to overlook that despite having played some other games with much better understanding of time travel. Despite the game's pacing issues, the story it sets out to tell is worth seeing through to the end and wraps up perfectly for what it's going for.

I can't say I've never seen stories like this before, but I think Last Day of June has more than enough clever ideas in gameplay and mute storytelling to warrant its existence as a short but decent time travel game. I liked it. 3.5 hours well spent.",True

PROS:
1. You get to be a goat.
2. There are lots of trophies and secret areas and lots of achivements.
3. You can lick people. You can lick chairs. Ever wondered what a grill tastes like? Now you know.
4. You get to be a goat.

CONS:
1. Limited space. I want to explore more! What's beyond the sea blue and the islands? I see mountians. I want someone to take me on a majestic sail boat to explore.
2. Laggy on non-gaming computers. This is mostly my computer. It's a good computer for doing easy work, but not for a realistic game like Goat Sim. I wish I could afford a gaming computer. Maybe one day. Turning the settings down helps a little bit.
3. Replayability. I want to play this more, but to me it feels like headbutt, jump, lick this, collect that, go to next place. I know there are extra features, but again with the lag.
4. Price. I got this during a Steam Summer Sale, so it was the low price of 2-5$, but I can't fathom paying 10$ for this. Now, a price like 3-5$ would pull in a lot more people.

My final rating for this game is a 7.6/10.

"This game has the best interface of 1 - 5.  The storyline is good (although I think Disgaea 3's story was the best of them all, too bad it's not on Steam yet).  The change to Chara World turned it from a item world-like map into what could best be described as a roll-your-dice-and-move-your-mice board game - it's fun, though.  There's no item warehouse anymore, which makes bribing senators a *lot* easier...however, there's a 2000-item limit, with no way to increase that limit.  Eventually, you will have to toss a lot of stuff, but probably not until long into the post-game (and yes, there's more to do after you finish the main story line, which will require a lot of grinding).  I recommend not using a FAQ until the post-game, unless something is just not clear; there's a couple of things that fall into this category.  You should be able to beat the game with your main character at level 200, and the others around level 120.

The story is full of ham-acting and certain pop culture references, but that's what makes the story enjoyable.  Definitely worth a shot, and you can get hundreds, perhaps thousands of hours of enjoyment out of this game.",True

"I bought this game when it was early access, at the time it ran pretty smoothly, but after release for some reason my computer just couldn't handle it. My PC stats are below, nothing special but I assumed it would be adequate, especially as I had no problems like I said when playing the game in the early access weekends. Now every time I try and play the game (if i can even find a server with space that does not have terrible ping) it is extremely jittery and will practically freeze when ever an explosion goes off (which is most of the time). I did try playing at very low settings but most of the problems remained and it made the game rather unenjoyable. Personally I have much preferred playing Rising Storm 2: Vietnam. It obviously is not as realistic as Post Scriptum but for me it satisfies the desire to play a fun, historical shooter, that replaces the fast paced chaos of call of duty with increased tactical thinking. If you do own a super computer and can play on max settings then I am sure you will enjoy this game.

"I almost don't want to recommend this, but I have to admit I had fun. The main problem I have is the number of choices overall. They are few and far between, or you'd pick something and it'd be like: ""that's not your real answer, instead you do this.""

Pros:
-Loved the humor, wasn't expecting so many jokes and it's just well written. Went really well with my character. Your evil, but the fun kind of evil. 
-I really liked the writer's style. Paints the picture really well, very impressive, felt like the villain I wanted to play.  
-Planning points was a really interesting and unique idea. You earn them in game and spend them when you feel you need to. These unlock secret options to make your next decision succeed.  
-Interesting world, very good world building. Things were introduced as needed, no long history lessons. 
-There's different heroes, villains, vigilantes, and organizations. Sometimes I found this too much and other times it worked really well.
-Favorite part of the game was chosing a sidekick. Interesting options and consequences. The sidekick acts more like your go to heavy hitter rather than an actual sidekick. 
-Quite a few love interests. Heroes, villains, and vigilantes. There's quite a bit of flirting, but you're not sure if you can trust them. The flirting kinda acts to build up the suspense, is this person gonna kiss me or kill me? 
-You can focus on 2 of 3 different styles of solving problems: ingenuity, combat, or terror. Using all 3 doesn't work out too well.  
-Eager to play again, check out the things I missed. 

Cons:
-You don't have alot of options when designing your character. Tech, combat, or apparition that's it. 
-Picking your lair doesn't matter, the story just makes genetic references to it. 
-Story jumps from 1st heist, to origin, to having a base of operations with anything your can imagine and an army of minions. Didn't see the need for this, it felt like a large part of your story was missing. 
-Not sure how I feel about the final fight, it's a bit too heroic for my villainous taste. 

Final Thoughts:
-Better to get it on sale. If you wanted a more serious tone, than you probably won't like it. But if you're willing to keep an open mind and looking for some laughs it's worth playing. The story hits it's stride mid game.

"Fuck Bethesda, $60 was spent on this, had a boring time for 4 hours. Got a new monitor years back and forgot about it. Tried it again recently to see if i could get more hours of fun out of it. Turns out, no Bethesda game supports 21:9 ratio screen (it a bit ridiculous, but I got it as a present and it beat my previous square monitor). In order to actually run it in a playable state on my monitor, I have to install a mod that fixes Bethesda's mistake and ignorance. As a matter of fact, if you look at the whole of Bethesda games, everybody else is fixing Bethesda's problems and making their games actually playable and fun. I get that Bethesda works hard to make games that are really big and sometimes ground-breaking, but they are notorious for bugs. This was my rant, I am in the worst of moods, and I hate Bethesda right now. I wouldn't recommend this game, or any other Bethesda games unless you are O.K. with spending full price on games that are filled with bugs, and later fixing those bugs yourself by getting mods online, taking up even more space.",False

"What's good:
[list]
[*] Very enjoyable combat, actually the best I've seen in a lobby based multiplayer focused game (e.g. Vindictus, Warframe, Elsword, and other MMO Brawlers).
[*] Very good AI, both for enemies and for bots filling blank spaces in your team. So much so that there's no issues doing a mission alone with bots (I've only been doing missions up to ""Veteran"", which I'd say corresponds to ""normal"" difficulty so far, though).
[*] Classes are unlocked fast enough. I don't know why they bothered with having most of them locked to begin with.
[*] It looks really good, and runs very well on my computer.
[*] The netcode appears to be robust: In 20 hours of play, I've noticed only a single lag (character standing in place for 2 seconds with a moving animation).
[*] No pay to win mechanics.
[*] Upgrades cannot destroy equipment and are rather accessible.
[*] Cosmetics are actually just cosmetics, and you can change the cosmetics of your weapon. If you think that's nothing, I'd point out that this is actually the only ""MMO"" Brawler (if you don't consider Warframe to be an actual brawler) I know to have this.
[/list]

What's not so great:
[list]
[*] This was the first time in my life that I feel a slight nausea while playing (and no, it's not related to the gore). It went away after a few hours of play.
[*] It still has bugs that will crash the game completely. So far though, despite having met 4 or 5 of them, it never happened during a mission, only in the game's lobby, so I don't consider it to be that bad.
[/list]

What's bad:
[list]
[*] Lack of content variety. There's enough classes and weapon types, but the rest is severely lacking.
[*] DLCs do not appear to fix the problem mentioned above, making them underwhelming.

"Gas Guzzlers is a great destruction racing game. Gameplay is your standard racing-with-guns experience, though I haven't seen a game like this with limited ammo before. You'll need to pick up ammo on the track if you run out. Opponents are generally beatable, but they occasionally seem to get unreasonable bursts of speed. Let me break it down:

GOOD:
Battle racing
Decent physics
Enjoyable player investment system (Car and customization unlocks are well paced and worthwhile)
Sense of humor (You can have Duke Nukem sound clips as your driver voice, the car names are all satirical, you get points for chicken squishing, etc.)
Graphics look great
Controller Support
Announcer (Yells ""DOUBLE KILL"" etc. during races)

EXTRA BONUS POINTS:
Reliant Robin ripoff car

BAD:
Poor optimization (I have to turn everything all the way down to get a decent framerate at 1280 x 720. FFS I can run Assassin's Creed IV better than this.)
AI sometimes feels cheaty
Input lag (at least with a 360 controller, haven't tested anything else)

As a last aside this exact game (so far as I can tell) was on Desura about a year before it showed up on Steam, titled Gas Guzzlers: Combat Carnage. Desura refuses to give Steam keys claiming it's an entirely different game. This seems pretty shitty to me, but I think the publisher changed since the original release, and most likely the new one didn't want to give out copies. 

Get this game if you like battle racing. Think VIgilante 8 or Full Auto. If it's your thing the $20 price tag isn't too much. On sale for under $10 I doubt you'll be dissatisfied even if you have only a passing interest.",True

"Dear Grinder  / Hack and Slay Fans,

1st of all the game is nice. 

Question why i dont recomment to buy it for even 5 € ?

Because the loot and crafting system s*cks like hell.

1st. 20 hours i was on early access and played all basic classes across to level 20-25.
I was so frustrated because every single special boss or quest just drops weapon for other professions in the game.

Today after the release i want to give this another try. But unfurtunaly same old here again.

I played a soldier twohanded sword mace axe .... what kind of drops ? Demolisionist Range weapons - ""ALL OF THEM !!!!"" after 6 hours of game play not one sinlge sword axe or mace better then the normal yellow tier stuff.

Also not one single armor for me what bases of physic .... everything cunning (rouge) or spirit (caster) based.

I need to rely on traders wher i buy my stuff or joining and leaving the ports to farm bosses for some very low stuff to make it to the next area.

ok looting not even fun. what is with crafting ?

Crafting: u put your scrapmatel what you save up to a good amount from the start to where to spend.

I desided to do this on lvl 25 because i was instant kill in the next area so in needed an update.

every crafting cost around 1.000 - 1.500 per try and 2 till 5 scrap. i got like 20.000 coins and 32 scrap.
what also dont match for the crafting part.

I spend my trys on crafting an armor! 8 Trys and i got exact same level what i am 25 but 5 times caster armor 2 times rouge and 1 time soldier armor (high armor rating and requested a lot of Physique) 

""but again with SPRIT BONUS !!!! (and some low resist) also caster not 1 green rarity or even more just yellow crap.

Now iam broke and frustrated again about this game.

I am sorry for this mad frustraded Review, but i dont like this game even after ""release state"" its lootsystem borken like hell ! and crafting is always a stat gamble so no real crafting system !

"Fun stuf:
Generally I do not like slash&hack genre, but this game is a very fun running with melee as a main weapons.
The levels design is beautiful and very well balanced for fighting small and large enemies that are a plenty.
The script is well thought and funny. Lo Wang bits is hilarious till the end.

There are many RPG elements that make this game stand out of usual first person shooter paradigm:
1) The mobs are diverse and random stats are making the play less tedious.
2) There is weapons upgrade system that uses loot ""Gems"" with dozens of stat types.
3) Skill cards that give you additional or enhanced abilites like damage boost, resistance and several more.
4) Slottable wepons of different types and quality
I'd say I believe that at least some mechanics were skillfully borrowed from the great titles like ""Borderlands"".

Not (much) fun:
There are like 5 different maps at all. Not counting boss arenas, and special ones for ""trials"".
By the end of the game you finish these maps like 10 times each and it starting to be boring.
Really strong upgrades are introduced from the time the half of a game completed.
And some these upgrades are intended to be grinded for like 100 iterations of one trial.
Maybe that is more a muliplayer option at all?

"Overall Early Access Rating 9/10

Alright after playing 40+ hours I thought I'd give my review to this game (pros/cons blow,  the post is long)

Firstly regarding this game I had my reservations but I am incredibly impressed by what I've seen so far from it. Firstly it's the only one game has come remotely close to remind me of rune factory itself (which is fantastic because rune factory is my favorite farming/rpg game), and I am very task oriented so constantly being challenged, even into summer and autumn is awesome and when I feel like I've got a foothold, the game throws me a hard-ball and gives me new ways to be challenged. 

Pros-

- Despite the limited combat types, they are engaging and fun to watch
- Play and Dating mechanic is a great way to introduce information about characters
- Lots of building and I like the extended process of building materials because it gives me time to do other stuff and it's more satisfying when you do finally build something
- Low matience farming! This is great cause I'm not constantly having to water everything (for a small farm that's fine but I tend to burnout in farming games if I have to water a lot of plants day in-day out, it's the no #1 reason why I stop playing prematurely). 
- There's a lot to do during the day (it's rare that I finish the day before midnight)
- Combat against a variety of monsters (still early access but i like the variety so far)
- The ability to go into the hazardous ruins without worrying about time (an automatic 3 hr time-burn before entering)
- The mining system is nice in the sense that you can search for relics or easily find ore due to visual markers in the vast ocean of stone, it is a good alternative to the intense dungeon splurging (think harvest moon animal parade) and the simple hit an ore with a hammer and get 3-5 items (story of seasons)

cons -

- Not enouh customization, particularly with combat (only available weaponry are blades/fists) and armors/clothes (I understand this is early access so I won't cast this as a major negative for now)
- FPS is a little glitchy, for graphic quality, my computer shouldn't have the issues that it has but overall works smoothly 90% of the time, still I would advise making sure that the code and graphic demand are more polished to provide a smoother gameplay. 
- Again probably due to early access, but there's not enough variation in dialogue, 5 heart/star characters should be saying different things to the PC than they do when they are strangers/aquiantences. 

Beyond this the game is definitely a fantastic start and arguably the best building/rpg/farming simulation game I've played outside of stardew/harvest moon/rune factory",True

"One of my favorite RPGs of all time and my second favorite Fallout game. (New Vegas is better IMO)
I always find some dumb way to make it more entertaining for me every play through. It is jittery at points and there are moments when it can crash and it does show a bit of age but that stuff can be overlooked by what makes it great. The combat, the dialogue choices, the characters, the quests (stories), and the awesome sci-fi elements that can only be possible in a Fallout game.

"I don't recommend this game. It's not terrible, and plays fine. It's just, you can do a lot better than this. There are so many more VR shooter games available that are better than this one. This game was just kinda ""meh"" for me. I can see what they were going for with the game. I grew up in the 80's and played the hell out of Operation Wolf in the arcade. This feels like a bad VR knock-off of that. The stages are minimal, fairly flat, and uninteresting. They feel cobbled together rather than expertly crafted. There is so much room for improvement and polish here. This could be a fantastic game, banking on more than just nostalgia. As of right now I feel it's less than average.

"This is an amazing game. Here are the bullet points:
It has simple mechanics, but the sheer variety it uses them to create is astounding. Puzzles are all presented in innovative ways.
At times I noticed the lack of music, but the sounds are mostly plenty atmospheric.
The art and animation are quite pretty. I did notice some glitchiness at the edge of some of the robots' silhouettes. It isn't obtrusive or even noticeable, however.
I liked the narrative. I found myself relating to the transient robots. The overarching plotline becomes more prominent towards the end, just like any story with a third act plot twist. That said, even until the last, there are interesting characters.
I particularly enjoyed those puzzles that involved the other robots in some way communicating with each other. Sadly, it seems those are hard to design? (That's not to say the others were unpalatable.)
The game also had moments of humour, which were often a little surprising. (It includes observational humour, my personal favourite.)

"Since playing my first video game in 1978, there are a few moments in gaming history that stand out for me.  Scenes or experiences that I will forever treasure, and remember where I was when they happened.  The dread and fear of the original System Shock, the death of Aeris in Final Fantasy VI, the first time I downed Arthas in Icecrown Citadel with my WoW raid team.

Add Life is Strange to that mix.  One moment in particular simply had me gasping.  One of those occasions when you actually get up and walk out of the room for a few minutes to regroup your thoughts.  I'm not going to even name when it happens, or give the episode because even anticipating it would diminish the moment.

As a 43 year old married man, with kids, I was pretty cynical about whether I'd even be interested in playing a teen-girl centered drama, but about half way through Episode One I was hooked.  I played the 5 episodes on 5 consecutive nights, each day looking forward to the moment when my wife and kids went to bed so that I could hook up the PC to our TV, put on my surround headphones and lose myself in the extraordinary world of Arcadia Bay.

My advice would be to allow about 2 to 3 hours for each episode and play each one through to completion - set aside enough time up front to make sure you can do the whole episode in one hit.  The impact will be all the greater for it.

Loved this game.  Loved every single little bit of it.  Weird, thought-provoking, funny, unpredictable, thrilling, mysterious and overwhelmingly enjoyable.  If it doesn't grab you straight away, stick with it.  You'll be glad you did.",True

"GTA V is a great open world game, it's mechanism is realistic enough and is a good time killer. It comes with GTA online where you can have your own character and get Free DLCs while grinding in heists or missions, solo or with friends, to get that new car you liked.

Fun facts about the game:

• It's based in Los Angeles, USA
• It has a foul language coming from the NPCs, so be careful buying it.
• It can be addictive, but fun at the same time, especially playing online.
• You might need to buy ""Shark cards"" to get some in-game money to spend on your favorite item(s) but i highly suggest you grind your way there, since heists are available and are a good source of money.

And finally, while GTA is a fun game, it has a problem with modding, or simply cheating, where you might find players using mods to alter the game's way to be, therefor making it either fun or unplayable, or even getting you banned by giving you Free money in-game, so i highly suggest you DON'T go near them and just leave the lobby as soon as you spot one. Other than that it's a fun enjoyable game.

"I've been a TOMB RAIDER fan since the beginning. However, I want to give the most honest non-biased opinion over the game that I can.

Rise of the Tomb Raider. Strange title, maybe they were trying to be cool and give it a Christopher Nolan BATMAN title. Lara Croft neither rises or raids that many tombs in this game, so don't be confused by the title. 

Fans of the original TOMB RAIDER series should feel upset yet satisfied with the direction of the series. The current direction of the game is both good and bad for Lara Croft. 

On one hand we have a new generation of gamers that are very interested in the game now with the impressive graphics and addicting gameplay elements of collecting stuff while playing as a very sexy, yet ridiculously short, hero named Lara Croft.

On the other hand we have a game that completely alienates the old fans by removing itself almost entirely from the original gameplay that we grew up with and loved. Gone are the days of exploring massive tombs and solving puzzles that required some critical thinking skills. The atmosphere of being lost in an ancient tomb scavenging for survival. 

TOMB RAIDER now is a very, VERY casual friendly Easter Egg hunt game with little to no threats. There is ZERO suspense from not wanting to fall to your death from a poorly timed jump and having to revert back to an old checkpoint crystal. Now, you kill Lara just for fun or with lack of concern but you spawn immediately in the same spot. The risk of death is completely zero.

It doesn't even do the Easter Egg hunt thing very well anyways. Most of the time you're trying to unlock everything the game drops in something that says you don't have the right materials to explore forcing you to back track, if you even remember where the Hell it was to began with. It's not natural or well thought out, the level design is terrible because of this. No matter the fancy graphics, this is frustrating beyond means being forced to back track during natural progression areas with invisible walls.

They're starting to take the story a bit too seriously. I would really like to see games start to use some comedic relief. The story in Rise of the Tomb Rider starts to become white noise, especially when Lara Croft talks to herself at every camp fire or when you pick up treasure scrolls with story that is usually unremarkable or uninteresting.

The graphics are  beautiful but is not optimized in the current build.  My GTX 980 stutters in the large map areas like the Soviet Installation. I eventually have to just turn it down to HIGH settings and switch back to VERY HIGH depending on the area I'm in. Sometimes I get 120 FPS on VERY HIGH and strangely for no apparent reason it starts to chug along at 20 FPS for no reason at all.

The combat is boring and non-challenging. I would rather be fighting large beasts, not dudes with guns. This is Tomb Raider, quit trying to be like Uncharted. Shooting dudes in the early TOMB RAIDER's wasn't fun either.

The few amount of Tombs are far too easily to figure out and some are short and uninspired. Each tomb treasure is the exact same model of a sliding book thing with some useless ability you really don't need.

You spend the majority of the game running in circles pressing right-stick in or whatever button you use to that will detect objects in Lara Croft vision. The annoying thing is sometimes it doesn't trigger and you have to spam the button because it turns itself off after you start moving. If I had an ability in this game that will keep Lara Croft vision turned on forever, I'd be one happy dude.

The outfit selection is boring and I think the community would like to see some original outfits return or a customization option to fine-tune how you want her to look.

Lara Croft has a beautiful animated in-game model but that's about the only thing positive I can say about the game. Well I think the ENDURANCE DLC mod has some potential but it still falls pretty flat in its current state.

Sadly, I think it's time to reboot TOMB RAIDER again already or bury the franchise.",False

"I came into this reluctantly. I’ve tried a fair number of dating sims, and I’ve only like two of them. I tend to find them pretty tedious, so I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed DD.

The artwork is lovely and the storylines are endearing and often funny. I liked being able to customize my dad (just remember to go for a neutral expression unless you want to see you character grinning happily while your date talks about his deceased spouse).

When delving into more serious topics, DD handles them in a very sympathetic way without weighing the game down with too much pathos. I found the Hugo, Brian, and Damien branches particularly delightful. I was surprised by how much the game made me care about the children and some of the dad-kid stories were my favorite parts of the game. The environments are warm and make you want to come back to chill with your dad dates and their adorable offspring.

It’s a lovely, friendly, cute experience that makes for a nice respite from stressful daily living.

A few complaints:

- Hugo’s voice acting was not great. It sounded like they went into a random echo-y dorm room and recorded a guy’s half-a**ed responses. And that’s a shame because the writing on his arc is fantastic. I ended up taking my headphones out so I wouldn’t be distracted by the VA.

- There are a few bugs to be worked out. The background music drops out if you load a save during the game and I got the creepy twins bug, which was hilarious but distracting.

- I wish it were longer.

These complaints are pretty minor and don’t detract from an overall great experience.

If anything about DD intrigues you, you should check it out. It’s not a erotic game and it doesn’t involve much skill, but if you like to get to know interesting characters, I think you’ll appreciate it. If the idea of wooing the Game Grumps doesn’t appeal to you (I get it), don’t worry, their voices aren’t really noticable.

I hope the devs decide to make more of this game, but even if they don’t, I look forward to whatever they’re working on next.",True

- A loving amount of detail has gone into desiging the weird and wild technological machines at your disposal, from the actual visual designs to the variety of weapons and their functions, stats and even flavortext herein. If you like customizing a mech not unlike armored core or such, you're gonna have fun with this.
- Gleeful amount of destructibility in all maps. The world is your sandbox to topple over and stomp.
- Great soundtrack. I'll admit I'm not as into the overt 80's synth stuff as some people, but if you like that kind of music, this is grade A material for you up with the likes of Hotline Miami. 
-Surprisingly fleshed out world building in the descriptions of pilots, locations, weapons, mechs, etc. It's nothing groundbreaking in it's own right, but it provides quite a bit of grim flavoring to what is, at first glance, a seemingly simple game. 


CONS:
-----------------------------------------
-Loadtimes are juuust long enough and the actual missions juuust short enough to give some noticable speedbumps to what is otherwise a fast and addictive game. 

- The weapon trajectory beams and targeting reticule UI. They manage to do a lot with it that helps feed you immediate information on potential targets. However, the trajectory beams are so bright and colorful they wind up distracting you from the actual targeting reticule, making aiming a slapdash process in the middle of a raging firefight. It's something that I think ought to be tweaked, and a minor inconvience overall- nothing game breaking.

"Like so many games that say ""Full Controller Support"" the game does not support the steam controller when running on macOS. After hours of fighting with steam settings, in game settings, trying the beta version, and everything else I could think of, I couldn't get past the first hole in the ground because the jump key didn't cause the character to jump. And it took hours just to get the game to respond to the controller inputs at all. Remapping the controller as ""Keyboard"" settings in game recongized the A button as the Z key. The Z key on the keyboard did cause the character to jump and the A button worked fine in the menu system but the A button still didn't cause the character to jump. The X button did cause the character to attack after mapping it in the keyboard settings, and the joystick worked fine for moving left and right, but I have no idea if any of the other mappings worked because I couldn't progress out of the first screen without being able to jump.",False

"This game is very addictive and I was hooked from the start. The early portions of the game, as you're getting used to all the mechanics and unlocking new things, is very fun. However, the gameplay just doesn't really develop much as the game advances and I found myself disappointed in the later stages of the game as whatever advancements were made felt insignificant and, honestly, a bit lazy. For example, I was very excited to unlock the ""fortifications"" tech as I wanted to build out a stronger defense from attackers, but once I finally got it, all it gave me was the ability to upgrade my ""watch towers"" to ""guard towers,"" an object that looks identical and is functionally the same, but is a bit sturdier and contains 3 people instead of 2. This is very common in the later portions of the game where the excitement of unlocking something new is usually met with disappointment.

It also isn't entirely clear how all of the technologies help you. You unlock ""cattle domestication"" which allows you to have cows, but it's not clear why you need cows. I guess milk? But I was already able to get milk from goats? And why is milk important? My people seemed to do fine drinking water? You unlock horses but all they do is pull carts which I already had donkeys for. I had hoped that people would ride horses to improve their hunting but that wasn't the case. Other than the sheep which give you wool, all of the animals seem useless and an unnecessary burden to your settlement. Other techs that you unlock just incrementally improve your tools, which is just not very satisfying. You go from flint axes to copper axes to bronze axes to iron axes to steel axes but never do you really notice any improvement and in fact the ratings for some of them are identical, so it doesn't feel like you accomplished anything by unlocking the tech.

Other concepts from early in the game also feel like they don't really develop. I mentioned that there are raiders who attack you but all that changes over time is that the amount of raiders increases. In the beginning of the game when you have a small settlement of 15 people and no weapons, it makes sense for a small band of raiders to rush your settlement. But the problem is that later in the game this mechanic is exactly the same, all that changes is they go from 4 raiders to 10 raiders. This just feels lazy, like the easiest thing to do to escalate the threat is to just increase num_raiders from 4 to 10. When you have a village of 100+ people armed with bows and swords, protected by a rock wall that goes around the perimeter, it makes very little sense that a band of 10 raiders would try to storm the gate and get instantly swamped with arrows. I had hoped that later in the game the attackers would get smarter and act with some sort of purpose instead of just blindly running into a slaughter, but again it just never advances beyond the early stages. I think a better mechanic would be if they tried to sneak into the camp to steal things from you, then at least it would be like they had some sort of goal instead of just a death wish.  

There is a trader who stops by and you can trade whatever you have for whatever he has. Early on this works well, and the traders have different goods and varying commissions which is a good idea, but yet again this just doesn't advance in any way. By the middle stages the trader really has nothing to offer you and the alerts you get when he arrives are just annoying. There is all kinds of potential here for currency to be introduced, maybe a banker who stops by occasionally, maybe anything other than the same trader who was stopping by at the beginning. The common theme for this review is WYSIWYG. The gameplay at the beginning of the game is the gameplay for the duration; it never really moves forward and for me that was disappointing.

In general, I like the game's system of allowing you to manage by creating tasks and setting resource limits, but the AI of the players makes this incredibly frustrating at times. There is no real way to prioritize tasks other than setting resource limits, and these limits tend to be treated as minimums rather than maximums. For example, it is the fall and there are crops to be harvested, but nobody is harvesting. When I check the tasks I can see that no fewer than 6 people are cutting down trees. Why? We already have 75 logs! The only way to get them to stop is to change my resource limit of logs from 100 to 50.  But I want to have 100 logs on hand, I just don't want people to be logging when there are crops to be harvested! There needs to be a system for prioritizing tasks. One way to do this would be to assign tasks to various seasons. For example, only chop down trees during the summer. Then in the fall, harvest the crops. Crop planting/harvesting was a continual source of frustration for me as my people consistently prioritized other tasks in front of it and I had to constantly change resource limits to get them to focus on the crops. We don't need a 15th fishing rod right now Belkar! Harvest the damn crops!

The way the characters go about their business at a lower level is also very strange, as they don't seem to act with any foresight or move with any fluidity. It seems that a villager will just randomly bounce from one task to another instead of working in logical steps to achieve a goal. You will see a villager grab a sledge and head out to the woods with an axe. Cool, he's going to chop down a tree and bring the lumber back to town, right? Well, he will chop down a tree, but then he will just walk away, leaving the wood on the ground next to an empty sledge for someone else to come and collect. I remember my father telling me growing up ""if you're not going to bother finishing a job, don't bother starting it!"" Villagers do this sort of thing often, harvesting one plant and then randomly moving on to something else instead of continuing to harvest, or hunting an animal and leaving the corpse on the ground for someone else to come and butcher. You might say, well they didn't butcher it because they didn't have a butchering knife, but then why did they go hunting without bringing one?!

The hunting mechanic is another one that doesn't develop and needs work. You mark an animal to be hunted, and my expectation when doing so is that some young, strong men will get the best hunting tools, maybe some warm clothes and some food, and then set off to hunt. But no, literally anyone in the camp who is available will just wander off after the animal with whatever they happen to have on them. This means that a 69 year old woman is ""hunting"" a bison with a flint knife. Mommy, grandma is wandering off after bison again! I think she has dimensia. In other instances, hunters will chase an animal to every corner of the map, and eventually die of starvation because they went too far from camp and didn't bring any food. Or, they will encounter a bear and instead of running away will actively try to fight the bear. When the villagers make these kinds of questionable choices there is no real way to save them from their own stupidity, so you just sit there and watch an old woman get mauled by a bear because rather than running away after it had turned in the other direction, she decided to throw something at it. Mommy, grandma is provoking bears again!

This sounds like a lot of complaining about a game that I played basically non-stop for 4 days, but it's because I think the game has great potential to build upon and I'm hopeful that the developers read these reviews and incorporate some of this feedback. It is a well-made game without many bugs that I encountered, and the controls and menus are very well thought-out and easy to use. I really hope the developers can build upon this game as I would really like to play a version of it that has more escalating gameplay, better task management, and improved AI.",True

"After trying the free trial version having better luck running the game with less detrimental effects than most have described. I went on to purchase the game as I had money set aside in case I did want it as none of the characters I like were in the free character list. I started playing more after that getting into constant 1 match then crashing to almost unplayable laggy matches where alot of my input where getting ate. I've seen this be common complaint but feel that it won't last for long, though what really upset me is the cheating I've seen happen in this game. I have no idea why they would releases this game with some sort of anti-cheat feature that would prevent the use of trainers or cheat engines to abuse it. As of right now I cannot recommend this game and I would not pay for it unless you are sure you are in for the ride that you admitting yourself to.

Having gotten the issues out of the way I can definitely say the combat is okish. I wish I had more options for HP attacks during a match than just one (I know Vaan gets two as his gimmick) However I feel that limits being able to play how I want with the characters I use as there are times I wish I had another HP attack in the match than the one I chose before going in. 

Here are my ratings for this game:
Current state: 4/10
After issues are addressed: 7.5/10

I feel coming from playing the first two games it really hinders my enjoyment as this game feels significantly slower and the balancing is making for no real innovations for high level play. Once you learn a combo or what really links which isn't much variation which will for me cause the game to run stale. I feel that if we aren't allowed to have multiple HP attacks we should at least have an option for various Bravery attacks to customize how people would like to play with that character.",False

"This is getting immediately compared to DMC, when it's probably closer to the Onechanbara games: simplistic aesthetic, enclosed battle space and a battle system that, while possessing some speed and flair, lacks a certain finesse. And, well, sword-wielding females making up the main cast. MKH merely lacks them wearing all but a bikini and a ten gallon.

For a doujin title, its rather respectable. Again: for a doujin title. The interface has a bit of tack to it and, as I said, the battle system doesnt feel as tight as it could have been. You are tasked with fighting things before fighting things and then fighting maybe other things before getting a boss fight. Who you fight. My main gripe with said fighting was how easy it is to trigger annoying, weak, inappropriate and, most importantly, slow to recover attacks without meaning to do so. I feel like that could have been easily avoided by having them only activate with another independent button -- a lock-on, for example.

The difficulty isnt to be sniffed at either, bosses in particular will be quick to whittle away if you dont wise up quick enough and its surprisingly easy to get stunlocked by mere mobs (another negative trait shared with the Onechanbara series). With no means to cheese enemies via a ranged attack or super mode featuring health regen the latter battles on higher difficulties can become a test of mettle more than anything.

Its a good little slasher and a fine example of what can come out of Comiket, just dont go in expecting a perfectly polished experience.",True
"Everything that can go wrong, will go wrong.",True
"I was really looking foward to playing this game. The skills are fun to use, and I think the art style is great. 
Lot of potential here!

Unfortuneatly... As others have brought out, the loot system seems great on paper, but new equipment brings little to the game other than higher numbers to allow you to advance in levels.

I feel the mistake they made is that you only get one weapon slot, while at the same time the weapons tend to be un-inspiring or tedious to use. Most games of this SHMUP genre will give you more weapon slots or change how a weapon acts as you progress, to really make things exciting! Like the rest of the equipment though, it's mosly, again,  just bigger numbers. Because of this, the game will quickly start to feel stagnant.

I'll keep my eyes on it though. If they were to release an update that would address this, I would be happy to try this game again. 'till then I'll keep my eyes out for Drifting Lands 2.",False

I could not put the game down until I reached to end of story and I still have hard time taking my mind out of the universe.

In addition others down voted because they don't like the exploring aspect. It's an exploring game expect to really enjoy it if you like that sort of thing and dislike if you like a linear story line with hand holding start to finish.

"After endless hours of tweaks, and spending more time in the ini files than on my university thesis I can tell you - don't buy it. The game in its current state is nothing more than a hyped up piece of crap. It runs like garbage, textures aren't properly mapped to models and randomly switch to their LOD variants, game is apparently full of Nvidia's GimpWorks (what a surprise huh?) that fucks up even their own performance and not to mention that the UI is console ported garbage and base features are missing from a 2015 title. You done goofed Ca$shtesda - big time. You were swimming in money and development time and look where it got you. Now take a look at CDPR's Witcher 3 - they didn't have even half of the budget / time to develop and have delivered what is personally for me one the greatest titles I have played. Shame on you Beth, shame on you. Oh but let's just wait for modders to fix it and feed Bethesda with that mentality, I'm sure that will work out great!

EDIT: 
So I decided to edit my review (although not my recommendation). So it's been nearly 17 days and guess what? Mods are already cropping up and I decided to try a few, along with tweaks and whatnot. I can't imagine this, but now not only does my game look better- it runs better. Modders have done it once again, hats off to them. This just goes to show how shit Bethesda really is. My biggest respect towards the modding community and thank you for actually making my damn game playable, I'm looking forward to seeing even bigger stuff in the future, cheers!

EDIT2 : New patch, more time has passed, more mods have gone up and basically - things are looking bright! So bright that I'm actually going to change my review's recommendation. After a clean install and roughly 1.5 hours of modding along with my previous knowledge of tweaks along with the long-awaited Crimson drivers for my little AMD card (good job on these drivers AMD, they're fucking awesome) the game runs beatifully (and looks like it as well) and I finally managed to fix the god damned non-loading textures (MipMapSkip set to -1 yo) Now I can get my ass handed to me by HD buttery smooth 60 fps deathclaws.

"From the gameplay standpoint, the game looks like great fun compared to about every other survival game out there. It takes something that would be boringly generic and revives it with both futuristic magical fantasy stuffs and everyone's favorate dinosaurs and revives the genre from generic ""punch tree and survive zombies"" to whatever you make it out to be, assuming you can prepare yourself before any unfriendly beasts come to tear you limb from limb.

Too bad I can't play it to find out for myself.

Right now, the game uses an unstable version of UE4 that makes playing it a chore, even on minimum settings for someone with a rig like my rig that can max out SE (with the new DX 11 update) and even have multiple stations on screen at once with all the lights on. But on this game I CANNOT get it to run above 30 FPS unless I set everything to absolute minimum settings, AA off or ""low,"" and even 25% resolution of 640x480 on my GTX 750 Ti. I'm basically runing around like a blind man, it took me 10 minutes to figure out if that thing floating in the water was a rock that I should go mine, or a shark, which ended up in me getting killed so take a wild guess what it was.

I'd love to recommend this game, especially with how much fun I could see myself having, but right now, reasonable cards are just not in this game's vocabulary. If you have anything less than a GTX 980 or some AMD equivlent, stay away or you'll have to endure FPS hell whilst trying to figure out if what you're holding is really a spear or not. But I've wasted a little bit over 3 hours of my life trying to get this game to be playable and at this point I don't even want my money back, I just want the damn thing to run so I can see what everybody enjoys so much about this game.




*UPDATE*
Managed to find a server and settings where I'm not lagging like crazy, but I still don't recommend buying this game if you have a weak rig like me.

There aren't many hazards in RiME, you may incidentally fall off a clip but other than that, there are a couple areas that have 'bad guys' which are barely a nuisance as long as you keep your distance.

"I feel conflicted about this game. One hand its more of the same characters as last time with new abilities and more depths, but on the other hand some of  the changes aren't for the better.

Pros
[list]
[*] Summons that everyone can use, meaning you're not relying on one person for needed help.
[*] A scan summon that scans all foes on the field meaning no more wasting a turn to find out what an enemy resists or is weak to.
[*] A more clearer view of how much damage an element will deal damage or heal an opponent.

Cons
[*] A worse menu that makes it harder to figure out what an ability does, cost, or if what the element is.
[*] A three person battle system that has four people, meaning battles aren't really balanced for the abilities you'll need.
[*] A story that is in the beginning worse than the previous game in motivating you to continue.

Now I'm still early in the game, but so far this game doesn't make me want to continue and explore. It just feels like the new character, Anna, is somewhat  like a self-insert character. She comes out of nowhere storywise, and our heroes are just okay with her joining them and tagging along.
Maybe it gets better later on, but the beginning shouldn't feel like a slog to get through because of a new character and horrendous menu design. If it improves as I play, I'll change the review.

"I hate writing negative reviews because they are just not my style. However, Arkane and Bethesda have left me no choice. 

I want to be crystal clear: this is the biggest waste of 50 Canadian Dollars I have had in recent times. If I had known what I know now, I would have gladly refunded this game within the first fourteen days and two hours of playtime. Sadly, it’s been a while since I have played this game and I was far too patient with this Frankenstein of a game. I know Steam is very generous with their refund policy, but even Valve’s generosity and pro-Gamer policies have their limits, and for good reason. 

1. Optimization is still terrible. This game has horrid frame-times, frame-rates, is somewhat glitchy and doesn’t work with AMD hardware and software. Don’t think that this game has improved because it hasn’t. I suspect the engine is at fault here. Even on console this game doesn’t run decently. Don’t even get me started at how bad the input lag is for this title. The amount of time it takes for the game to respond to your inputs is terrible and puts Fallout 76 to shame. The worst expression I can give for this game is it’s like watching a move that breaks up every fifteen seconds. It’s the exact type of material to make sure you have the most unpleasant and jarring experience of your life. 

2. Gameplay is good, but what’s the point of that when you cannot play the game at playable settings and frame-rates? You can have the best gameplay, but if the engine is dated and stressed all the time, then it is unlikely that the gameplay will be able to show its true colours and qualities because the basics are done very wrong. There is plenty of things to like here, but sadly, the biggest and most important fundamentals have been done so poorly. 

3. Lack of support for the game. Sadly, Arkane and Bethesda seemed to have given up on this game. I haven’t seen a genuine patch or fix for this game come out recently and none of the patches seemed to have made any difference. It’s like they kept applying bandaids to the game’s many wounds and realized their problems stem much deeper than a couple of driver issues. The fact that the game still has persistently bad optimization and bugs just goes to show how futile their efforts to fix the unfixable were. 

Alright, I have had enough. I consider this one of the worst purchases I have made in a while I sincerely hope, dear reader, that you try the demo first and see if it runs well. While this game has plenty of levels and gameplay mechanics to offer, none of it would count for scrap if the game engine runs very poorly and cannot render the game at playable frame-rates and frame-times. Don’t fall for this trap. Try the demo and make sure you can run this game because it is so volatile and unreliable, especially on AMD hardware and software.

"This game is great. Seriously. It has great gameplay, this being combat and movement, great voice actors (if you dont like that there is already a mod to take that out), some very addicting mechanics like the gun and armor crafting and the settlement building, good enough graphics, specially for a fallout game and nice soundtrack. However, it should not be called Fallout. The story is pretty simple and predctible, the characters are okay at best, there is no such thing as choice, except name and appereance of course and forget about roleplaying. Your character is a good boy/girl that was either a soldier or lawyer before the war and now wants to find his father liam neeson. oh sorry I meant your baby. Pretty sure in Fallout 5 you gonna go search for your uncle Bob. All in all, it's a great game that I'll defintly keep playing, but since it has Fallout in it's name, I just can't give it a thumbs up. Also, Bethesda should learn with Obsidian...

"Long long time ago, when dragons ruled the sky, there once was a developer who created a game.

But... the dark times have come. The developer become sick on mind. His sickness drowned him into darkness, and he was no longer the same. He forgot about his creation, leaving it on a cold stone deep in the mountain cave. The game, lying on the stone, cried for a first time, and all people who put their hopes in it cried with it.

The time have passed, world has changed, and everybody forgot about the game. The developer wend old, probably died or hidden somewhere in great forest, nobody knows. The game itself is now lost, noone cared about her for a long time, and it lays in ruin, being slowly consumed by the sickness of its creator. The legend says that some day someone will find that cave, take out the game to the daylight, fix it from the bugs that are poisoning it and flooding its veins, and the people will give their hearts to DayZ once again.

"*5/10
If this was a release date review I woudn't recommend this game.  It came out at $60, and there just really isn't anything in this game to justify that.  The game has it's highlights, and I'll admit, it is rewarding to build a true empire, but since there is only a euro map, with areas segmented off for smaller games, there really isn't much actual content.  Warfare is far too simple, and the tech tree is a joke.  They really would have been best served to have set this kind of game later in the timeline, and opened up the entire world.  That would allow for unique nations, that would have really added greatly to this game.  All in all it's worth the $30 now, but just barely, also with no DLC coming out, the game kind of falls flat.  

All in all, if you're a fan of this kind of game, you'll like this, but if I where to give this an actual rating, it would be a 5/10, which is just meh. 

Oh, and the whole preorder only DLC fiasco is complete BS.",True
"Pros: 
Easy, seated VR experience played from a ""giant's"" perspective. 
Adventure Time fans will appreciate the character interactions (they talk TO you)

Way, way, way too short. Story (what little there is) ends abruptly. Price is reflective of the amount of content.
Magic Man doesn't actually play games with your head. I was expecting more tomfoolery from this.

I'd only recommend this for diehard fans of Adventure Time and for kids. I imagine it would be a decent way to get them to sit still for 30-40 minutes.",False

"I really really wanted to back this game 100% - but after the many years of development and years in early access, there are still many, many glaring problems.

The small bugs and glitches are not nearly as prevalent, but when they appear, they are gamebreaking!
Like if you build a houseboat, don't expect to put anything in it, because what you place there might become unusable after you move the boat. The other normal problems, like having the house sink when you're not there are rather big problems too.
The one biggest complaint I have is definitely how if I have a full log storage, and the storage is broken or destroyed, it doesn't just break the 6 sticks it took to build, it despawns EVERYTHING in it. Same with a treehouse.  So - if that tree gets cut down, do i get to salvage some stuff or maybe even the pot that was attached to the trunk? HELL NO! :(
And if you decide to stop building something mid-build, be ready to have ALL your materials dissapear. 

There's a very limited sense of direction to the game, and the problem inherent is that if you spend 5 hours gathering everything you want together to have a full sustaining houseboat, only to find out it doesn't work at all because the game has no way of telling you what CAN work together... it's just infuriating.  It literally means, i have to restart the game and build EVERYTHING (if that's even possible because the climbing rope seems to never work on anything) to simply TEST and FIND OUT what I can do! It needs more build/craft direction, or... if i can't make it a house, don't call it a houseboat.

As for the other gameplay, the enemies are so aggressive it's almost impossible to remain in a single location, or survive without the help of others by using multiplayer. The aiming is completely sketchy and unintuitive - my spear throws were always a guess at best....

But the game still has it's charm. It's possibly worth investing in - IF it ever gets debugged, updated and have a few of those ""janks"" removed from it.  (and where did my effigees go??? :( why remove the ONE deterrent for the enemies!?)
But I'd definitely say wait on this game till it's 5 bucks, or till it's updated.",False

"Came to this game very late, but wow is it still amazing in 2019. Looks graphically really good, and man is the gunplay, gameplay really, REALLY fun, and freaking HILARIOUS. There is nothing like beating people  in the game with a giant d*ldo stick. Driving around is fun and the open-world feels very big. Story isn't the best but it is easy to follow along with and none of the missions really feel tedious. They give you choice without it destroying gameplay or the story and doesnt mess it up. Definitely some hard parts that are frustrating to get through like the final(not really) mission or the Deckers cyber mission. A.I is most definitely subpar, and not the best, however beats many other A.I systems of the time. I would recommend this to anyone whos trying to have a good laugh, have lots of fun, not to take so serious, and take a change of pace from the current games scene. The DLC missions/items is well spent and very good. If you buy the DLC ""Unlockable Pack"" make sure to disable it before reaching max level to not ruin/spoil the game for you. Also if you're running an i5, or 4 core 4 thread equivalent, make sure to change the affinity in Windows for the game to run on only 2 cores or it WILL CRASH everytime! If that doesn't work disable Steam overlay, or both. Overall this game is about a 9/10. If the game crashing bug was fixed, and my couple of small gripes were fixed (which IS nitpicky), and was slightly longer this game most absolutely be an 11/10 still in 2019. Really wish I had bought this game and all of its DLC at full price to support the dev's, as I got everything (DLC and Game) for $3 on the Autumn Sale. Most absolutely worth every penny.

Bioshock is one of the great game series of all time.  I've played it through when it first came out and a couple times more over the years.

This is my first time playing the remastered version it looks and plays great but it crashes a lot.

"Palyed with a friend, we choose an island standart, start crafting our house and scaping from bear and such, later we try to find clay, nothing on all the island surface, made a raft and sailed searching for other island.
My friend looks on google to know how to find one or clues but he found the mode he choosed to play has only our island and plain ocean, we were 15 minutes on a mini raft while i put my phone near the mic with Pirates of the Caribbean and we fell a lot of times to the water in the middle of nowhere.

New island on the mode that tells u how many islands are around, 5 and the one we spawn, nice we say, we even found clay, in the end my friend is gay, each one builds his house and we decide to build the bigass sea and thieves galleon, we sail, he moves and i use the anchor and the map with more pirates themed music.

First island, another ""european rock"" meh we say, we found clay, in the end my friend is gay.

Second island, jungle, found an npc, he doesnt talk, we destroy his house to loot it, i got a nice crab trophy, he found a carpet and we sailed again.

Third island, another jungle, more bananas, another npc but not house to loot, i found copper and he found an npc trader, we sail again.

Then while we slept to pass the storm, i was starving and started to eat non-stop, he sailed and i tried to use my map, i managed to eat it, it was crunchy, he tried to make charcoal on the bottom of the sea but didnt work so we went back to the island to make the charcoal for the map.

"The only good part about this game was legacy, now that legacy is gone there is no reason to get it. Legacy was amazing, the map wasn't random (like it is in new rust) the building system was simpler and much more streamlined making it easier, every gun and item served a purpose at somepoint you would use every gun, the game was optimized and still didn't look awful, and not everyone was kill on sight.

New Rust (I know it's been out for a while but I'm still going to call it New Rust) has a random map, making it nearly impossible to find your way. The community has gotten much worse than it was in lebacy, everyone that I saw was a kill on sight player, this made it impossible to start on heavily populated servers. The crafting/building system is far too complex for a game like this. The game is also very poorly optimized, unless you have an amazing PC you will have trouble running this game, I've got a pretty good PC and I still have low frames on fastest graphics.

However, I am disapointed in the fact that there aren't many factions, I suppose they try to make that up with the added lords or what not, but it is still quite disapointing i hope that they add more factions, because it is quite sad with the few ones they offer; furthermore the DLC is jsut ridiculous, they should include and not charge extra for just the simple extra things you get out of it, is it worth 60 bucks.....ehhhhhhhhhhhhhh probably not i guess its alright though :/",False

"Some people may remember a gem of PC gaming history called Gearhead Garage.  This is basically that game, but much, much better.

And I have to give Gearhead Garage props, that game sucked me in for hours when I was younger.  It was incredibly simple, and can probably be easily converted to a flash game at this point.

So you can imagine my elation when I saw this game.  Since it was indie, I didn't want to pay full price.  I've been burned by too many boring, broken, or incomplete indie games in the past on Steam.  I can say, knowing what I know now, I would definitely pay full price for it.

At this point I am addicted to it.  For me, that is being stuck at work, and looking forward to getting home and playing th is game to unwind.  I usually play for an hour or so at a time (I'm a casual gamer).  That's pretty rare for me, only other games to do this are bigger hits like GTA V or The Last of Us.

I'm a huge car nut, so I very much enjoy this game.  I've tinkered in real life.  Granted, the game completely simplifies all the repairs, but it's still satisfying and doesn't feel mundane or boring.

I also really like the fact that you can ""learn"" things such as increasing profits, reducing parts prices in the catalog, or increasing the speed of removing bolts.

Each scenario feels like a puzzle, and a few times I've been stumped and had to look something up online.  If you have any automotive experience, some of the jobs are easier for you to tackle, since you've probably experienced it in real life; e.g. tires are wearing out fast (suspension), car shuts of randomly (fuel pump), etc.  If you don't have experience, you will probably learn a thing or two, that is pretty cool.

As far as graphics/sound/controls.  The graphics seem slightly unoptimized, FPS can dip down once you're in the shop, but the graphics don't look incredibly detailed.  Sounds are average, nothing amazing there.  Controls aren't too bad, the camera can be annoying sometimes with how it zooms.  But after a while you'll get to a point where you're flying through all the interactions and whatnot, so it's easy to get the hang and feel of.

If you're a car nut like me, and have actually worked on cars before, this can be a fun romp for you.  I'd definitely recommend trying this game out, it is well polished, and well executed.  Big kudos to the developers!",True
"Honnestly great game as most have said. However with me the ONLY reason it deserves a bad rating is the game background mechanics are just broken.... The devs have actually PROMISED to have some form of Hackshield/Antihack program introduced before the game went full release.... THEY DID NOT DO SO AT ALL!!!, in fact the game has been released since March 7th 2015 (For myself) and March 8th 2015 for others. In Beta they had a whole slough of hackers teleporting, speedhacks, aimbot, ESP, Etc... Problem was (And still is) that the game is pretty well entirely client side. Which means any dumbass can use a 3rd party program and change their stats then load the game and the server doesn't even do an accuracy check or anything... They are ONLY JUST NOW as of April 12th 2015 going to add in the feature of reporting hackers relying soley by the other players sending in report tickets of players (They believe to be hacking) Yet still absolutely no hackshield/Antihack system in place at all...Even if it's proven they are not getting perm banned only 3 day suspension... Until their next offense which is perm....


Among the hackers the game has many glitches and exploits in pretty much everything from skills to gear to just texture map glitches, You constantly get server disconnects, and your account not being accessable due to no one actually knows why yet. The game seems like a rush job (Despite the game being in make for as I recall about 5 years) a lot of these things should have been caught if there was a longer peiod of ""Open Beta""  


In conclusion, who knows the game may improve over time, but at this point it seems like it will be a very long rocky road ahead with plenty of twists and turns.",False

"Back when this game originally released it was considerably lacking in content and had a few rough edges.  I even gave it a thumbs-down due to the lack of content you were getting for the money.

Today, the game is quite enjoyable (and a good deal when on sale) with a bunch of community-made content and some very well-made maps for you to slaughter hordes of zombies on.  I still have a couple nitpicks with the game (mostly class balancing issues and the lootcrate-key microtransaction dynamic) but can overall recommend the game when you might not have a several hour-long timeslot to invest in a more story-based title or expansive RPG.

FYI, the game is most enjoyable with friends, but you can also play with random strangers online.  I haven't delved too much into the online though, so I have no idea how communicative or independent others play.",True

"(I initially gave this a ""Do not recommended"" thumb down for reasons that I have left in my original review below. The reason I am now giving it a Thumb up, is because with help from players on the forum, and their recommendations re. Sweetfx use and settings, all the issues with this port are, for me, basically ""fixed"". Be advisesd though, without using your own filters, or short of hooking up to an arcade monitor, this ports filters are not not as usefull as the XBLA version from witch it is ported.)

original review below:



This is a port of the XBLA version of the game.
Quite simply, this Steam port is dreadful. The sprite filter options are here but have minimal effect.
As said elsewhere in the review section, there is a distinct ""line"" around the sprites, hightened even more by the fact that the backgrounds in this port have been forced into hi-rez.
The screen scrolling, as your character moves left and right, suffers from judder, despite constant frame rate.
All this makes your inputs feel laggy.
I have seen others point out these problems in the reviews and they get thumbed down.
Likewise, in the forums, they get accused of not appreciating ""pixel art"".
The issue is not a lack of love for pixels. The issue here is a bad port.",True

So if you like having fun with your friends, and 1-person shooter games, I can only recommnend this game.",True
"My favourite game from my favourite developer. It's not a classical RPG. We, as a player, are forced to play as Geralt from Rivia rather than any Witcher we create ourselves. And that's not entirely a bad thing.

STORY:
Storywise this game is on another level. Pacing of main story is perfect. Never gets boring, always stores a surprise behind a corner. Each side-quest has its own story, even simple delivery quests, which makes it all the better.

EXPLORATION:
CDP introduced quick travel with this game and that was a must for such a vast world. The entire map spans over 2 huge and 2 medium-sized locations. 1st expansion enlarges one of those huge locations even more and another expansion add an entirely new place with size similar to those big boys. You won't get bored travelling through the world as Geralt. It's just not possible.

GAMEPLAY:
Fighting mechanics are easy. Problably too much. And that might be the only problem with this game. Everything else works perfectly, although some people may not like a rather oddly implemented skill tree system.

GRAPHICS:
Some textures might need some more work, but it's nothing a mod can't solve.

SUMMARY:
I bought this game twice. One Collector's Edition for GOG and this one - for Steam, and i probably buy another one for N Switch. It's perfect 10/10 from me, as i love to invest myself in deep stories of that world and its people.",True

The art is good and the gameplay is awesome, it also doesn't hurt that this game will run on anything from a potato pc to a beastly machine I can't imagine.
      Bottom Line. A great sequel to TD4 and would recommend it to anyone with a pc.

Great game, pick it up asap.",True
"This first person shooter game is perfect for you, if you want something that will give you hours or play time. The game now provides an introduction to the newer players, letting you play against people new people as well as giving you a guide on how to play. Firstly, there are multiple matchmaking options, a training mode, a store where you can buy all of the operators, weapons skins & camos, outfits and much more content. This can be purchased  with the ""Renown"" (in-game currency) that you'll earn by playing the game, killing in different game modes as well as also winning, etc. The game modes are Hostage, Bomb and Secure Area, the most common being Bomb. In these modes you play as attackers for half of the game and defenders for the other half, these roles are very self explanatory.

There's also many different editions or versions of the game and I highly recommend taking any of the editions available, except the ""Starter Edition"". Why? Because the starter edition is just giving you access to a poor variety of operators on both the attacking and defending teams. The other editions will allow you to access more of the operators and for a cheaper in-game price. The better edition of the game = more expensive overall but has cheaper operators. The Deluxe edition is giving you access to the operators of the normal edition + the DLC's operators of the Year 1 Operator. The Gold edition will give you more operators, from the Year 1 Operator and the Year 4 Pass. And for the last edition, the Ultimate, you will get every single operator of every year. The Year 1, 2, 3 and Year 4 Pass. 

When i originally purchased the game (a few days after release) There weren't any editions, just the bog standard game.... now after playing the game for 1.5k+ and doing some research into all of the different game versions we can see that:

The cost of four operators, compared:

Rainbow Six Siege Starter Edition: 50,000 renown (~60+ hours worth of gameplay)
Rainbow Six Siege Standard Edition: 5000 renown (~12 hours of gameplay) 

Overall, I can say that in-game renown wise, you'll be getting between 100 renown and 300 renown per game, this depends on your kills, total points and if you win or not. At the end of the day its up to you what edition you go, take any edition you want. If you want the game to be harder and you want to grind to unlock everything get the starter or standard. If you want a little head start and a taste of what you can unlock but there is still plenty to learn and grind for, then get the Deluxe or the Gold edition of the game. If you want everything to already be available for you to use straight from the get-go then take the Ultimate edition. The Deluxe or the Gold edition of the game gives you the best overall idea of the game. It gives you a few operators, but not all. It allows you to pick between a few operators to let you understand the game and your play style. As well as also not being the cheapest or most expensive versions of the game.",True

"Edit: Typo's

I wrote a long review and then just hit delete.  Long story short game has potential but it will remain unfulfilled because Kalypso always has horrible post release support.  The game feels rushed with a concentration on graphics and a complete failure on mechanics; it's less a train empire simulator than a mobile game.  I have beat the entire campaign and I still have no idea the mechanics of the game nor how I would lose; it's that shallow.

Which is a shame as it has potential, just need to fix two glaring problems as well as two tweaks:

1) Need a way to either DISABLE (as an option) share buying OR allow you to do stock repurchases.  I hate nothing more than games with instant lose conditions that you have ZERO influence over.  I had to quit playing after the campaign because I got sick of instant losing scenarios even though I was meeting (or on my way to meeting) all scenario objectives on time. I'm fine instant losing if you fail to meet an objective, I'm not fine when the AI forces you to instance lose via mechanics you can't influence (i.e. they simply buy your company and you can't influence that)

2) The need to fix freight so it works like people and mail when it comes to multiple cities.  It stupid every city doesn't function as a transparent warehouse allowing you to forward freight across multiple cities.  Sure you can work around this BUT that is a PITA you either tie up loading docks or ugly rail lines because it's near impossible to do a Y junction with the rail mechanics and area limitations. or poorly used octopus warehouses 

Tweaks:

1) Need a way to either auto upgrade trains OR mass upgrade; gets old upgrading hundreds of trains three clicks at a time each train

2) Stations should NOT be limited to 4 tracks; easy tweak should be 4 pass through tracks or end of line tracks with either 4 or 8 platforms dependently.  

PS: And I really can't stress enough the game mechanics make no sense and it's sad I have no idea how the game plays and I won first time through.  Also the choices (tech, engines, special characters; supply towers,  repair facilities, etc) all feel meaningless as in I didn't notice ANY real impact both times I play through (the second time not upgrading or buying anything; played the same way and I still won).  Game also should display ROI based on contextual information, i.e. ""If I upgrade this train, what is my ROI on this track"", ""If I research this tech, what is my ROI given everything it will apply to in my existing company"", etc.",False

"Twelve years ago, Advent Rising was my favorite game. Now, it's testing my patience as I try and force myself to keep playing it to the end. 

If you did not play this game when it first came out, Advent Rising has very little going for it. If you were fond of it like I was when it first came out, things might be a lot different than you remember. 

If you ask a fan of Advent Rising (and if you're still out there, DM me because I've never met you), two names will often be brought up: Tommy Tallarico and Orson Scott Card. 

Advent Rising not being the hit that it wanted to be is a shame because it meant that not too many people are aware of Tommy Tallarico's excellent work as the game's music composer. Seriously, go look up the tracks Muse, Bounty Hunter, and Poeta. Some of the most stand out and inspired video game music of that decade if not of all time and it will never get the recognition it deserves because Advent Rising flopped. 

Yes, Orson Scott Card is attached to this thing as he apparently had a major hand in writing the script. Regardless of how you feel about the accomplished science fiction author (particularly his controversial stances on homosexuality), the story being told here isn't too bad for a video game released in the mid-2000s. But that's just the problem, isn't it? It's not bad. They've got Orson Scott Card, the writer of Ender's Game. My guess is there's lot of story that was cut somewhere due to time restraints as the opening feels incomplete, cut, particularly little time is given to characters and when the game forces you to make a decision that revolves around the game's characters, I doubt apathy is what they want gamers to feel the most. 

The story wasn't the only thing chopped (presumably, I do not know for sure) because of a rushed schedule; this game is glitched and bugged up the ass. Within the early sections of the game, I found myself stuck in the geometry, doors not opening, and of course, multiple game crashes. There is a fan patch restoring cut content exclusive to the Xbox, not fixing some of the issues you will experience during gameplay. 

Aside from that, gameplay isn't terribly interesting...at first. One of the most fatal missteps in Advent Rising is its beginning. The difficulty is out of control. I can assure you I am far from the worst gamer in the world and these early sections are inane shooting galleries often complemented with ""defend this area until elevator/door arrives/opens"" with wave after wave of enemy bullet sponges coming in. 

Once you get past what could be considered Act One, things start to grab your attention as you delve deep into the game's mythology. This is where Advent Rising starts to take a sharp shift away from Halo clone to its own identity. 

Despite the multitude of issues that would kill any sort of hope for any recommendation, I can't quite say stay away from Advent Rising despite its technical issues, game-killing as they might be. 

Advent Rising isn't quite the flawed masterpiece like say, Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines. Think of it a few notches above Alpha Protocol. If none of these games ring any bells, let me put it this way: 

It's very clear that the people who made Advent Rising were passionate and put a lot of their heart and soul into it. I read that the game's director Donald Mustard had the idea since he was in high school and his favorite book was Ender's Game. Whatever cult status Advent Rising has achieved to this day is most likley stemming from how genuine and heartfelt the whole production is. 

Somewhere in this buggy mess is a classic science fiction story trying to happen but it needed at least six months, a year. Also an increase in the budget to tell more story. 

I ultimately do recommend this game but with caution and a heart as open as your mind will allow.",True

"I like dinosaurs, I enjoy building, and surviving off what you can get or grow is fun.

However . . .

Items take far to long to make if you count in the total time it takes to gather materials. Most material costs for even the basic gear is pretty insane if you actually step back and think about it (you need to cut down dozens of trees to make a 4x4 thatch base with a roof). The thatch building materials are utter crap as they take little to no effort to tear down from other players. This poses a huge problem to new characters because having shelter is life in this game. If you cannot find a friendly on server you might as well just not even try progressing past the wooden base and such blueprints because you'll get KOS as if this was prehistoric DayZ (but you probably won't have to worry about progressing that much further anyway as playing by yourself means you'll maybe get to level 15 in several days of playing or a straight 6 hours of level grinding -- fun). If you play on a PvE server you can avoid the kill crazy PvP players but you'll then have to face off against the literal hordes of carnivores.

Raptors & Dilos spawn nearly as much as Dodos.
Argins (huge vultures) & T-Rex are pretty common place for being pretty well Apex Preds.

If the hordes of carnivores or serial killers don't put an end to you, just wait until you have to deal with the utterly ridiculous metabolism system. Your character will eat his/her weight (several times over) in cooked meat. But to get meat you have to kill, which means going probably pretty far from your shelter, to find a slow herbivore while making sure you don't get dunderfucked by a raptor horde. So say you don't want to be a meat guzzling freak of nature. 

You can eat berries. All of them. Every berry but 2 (Narco & Stim) have no adverse effects and you can eat them to regen your water as well as food meter. However if you thought demanding a full steak every 5 minutes was bad, try eating literally hundreds of berries to maintain yourself in a two hour span of time.

TLDR
+ Dinosaurs 
+ Building
- Material cost is too damn high
- Hostile NPCs spawn far too frequently
- Most players KOS or break your shit for giggles
- Mind numbingly slow leveling
- Metabolism system is insanely quick to empty and hard to maintain

"This game is what one would expect from an Aldorlea game, as in it has a good plot, nice characters, and is fun. The Moonchild of the title is an 8-year-old princess, who is kidnapped.

"  The leveling, exploration, and first time through the missions were all good. Cover based shooting would improve survivability, and I had to be smart to succeed.

The mobs in the missions became unstoppable bullet sponges charging at me with shotguns and surviving (I didn't). With the most recent patch, the ""improved"" questing to get intel on high priority targets quickly became repetative, and the previously released incursions were cheese or die.

"No Man's Sky is a good attempt at reaching for everything in a genre that games are usually locked into one or two aspects. It does a good job at making things like (Space Combat, Ground Combat, Exploration, ""Vague Storytelling"", and Space Simulation) Simple for a larger audience. Now simple doesn't mean bad especially if the amount of simple things are put together to make a larger more complex story or game. What seems like a game of resource gathering, vague storytelling, and alien races turns into a narrative driven by the player, Yes a story exists however this story is left broad for a reason. Yes alien races do exist (However in smaller numbers then what is typical for other games of the genre) They exist to ping off the character and narrative that the player makes, By making the species of aliens so keenly fit into certain niches of the genre you will be naturally drawn to one or another. This applies to exploration as well, while some people might find a planet full of mushrooms and toxic spores interesting and might even adapt their character to live on them. I do not however No Man's Sky has allowed this to happen for a reason. You may be stuck in or on areas that seem horrible and that may hurt your eyes or brain to look at however this makes it so much sweeter when you finally find a place that you can call your own for one reason or another and makes the journey before (though some of it may be rough and horrible) feel a lot more worth it. There are some aspects that are a little too easy (what comes to mind is how the player gets their first ""Frigate"" or how me as someone who primarily plays Elite: Dangerous would call it a Fleet Carrier) these will hurt the experience for people that are either older or more used to the genre. Overall I have concluded at least in the non spoiler part of my review that if the art style of No Man's Sky was a little less cartoonish and the game was a little less casual (This is my personal preference of course) I would call it the best space game I have ever played. However due to the nature of the game and what platforms and audience it was made for it is prone to at times feeling like you are basically riding a railroad track disguised as a space game. 7/10 (Check below for spoiler section and new rating based on these facts)


(Potential Spoilers Ahead)


No Man's Sky's narrative is interesting however it falls short in the fact that everything is very heavy handed. Your character professes in potentially the last couple of story missions ""I AM A SIMULATED ENTITY"" despite player input saying they ""Could be real"" or something similar. Also the fact that everything is a simulation is smacked in your face as soon as the opening of the game (not subtly either) I understand the game was made for younger audiences however this ""story"" or aspect of the game had me just wanting to finish it so I could go make a cool underwater base and get an alien like space ship. The story drags in places and your decisions in the end don't really matter (These being the fates of two (potentially three?) fellow ""Travelers"" you meet along your journey one who is named =Null=. Very subtle indeed) The potential narrative given by ""Haunted Terminals"" is never played on since this is a simulation. It could very well be that other entities made this as a sort of game for others to find. The only plot I could find interesting was self (and maybe a bit by the game) the flying robots IE: sentinels appear out of no where sometimes when you are doing things in the game, This lead me to believe (After the ""SIMULATION"" theory was confirmed) that these things could be anti viruses and that the ""simulation"" that we live in was made as a sort of show of computing power or show of a computer's understanding of life (Specifically an AI's understanding of life) however where this falls flat is the fact that later down the road you learn that ATLAS the main focus of the story has been repeating the same cycle for 16 minutes of its shutdown period... it has retreaded inside itself and is making infinite realities in itself to figure out what is wrong and what it can do to fix it before it is shut down. However the problem may be that the AI sees life so simple that three alien races can be put into cliches (Scientist, Merchants, Warriors). I do see that the AI could of been exposed to genocide (IE WW2 or such) while being given info to simulate reality in its own experience, and this would explain the first ""simulation"" and the ""Error"" that the creator of the AI saw. However this doesn't make the game less bland since it (at least in my 110 hours of the game) never explains this. 

Overall the Story doesn't need to be in the game it adds a lot to think about, However it forces a wedge between what could of potentially been greatness and early reviews (though unfair in some degrees) reflect this... It seems the story was really thrown in at the last minute to explain something that didn't need explanation.

Overall Score 8/10 (Though the story didn't add anything to an average player and may even confuse them greatly, It got me thinking and that makes it decent however the way these missions were executed especially the last ""official"" mission was very well done)

No button remapping outside of left/right handed mode(the dpad on my right vive controller went soft making dialog options hard).

"Being a veteran from tabletop Mordheim I just had to try this game. Like most games I feel this game has its strong points, oddities and areas with room for improvement.

Yay!

- I like the graphics and the field of view when you run around the city with your warriors, at no time did I get odd camera angles or lost sight of my warrior.
- I like the movement system and the option to retrace your steps when you realise you ran the wrong way (This ofcourse is not possible if you get ambushed/ step in a trap/ pick up loot.)
- Once loading is finished the missions are smooth going.
- I like the campaign system. The missions in itsself arent too varied but every battle is hugely differant anyways.
- customization is quite nice. Some more wouldnt have hurt at all but you can give your warriors fairly uniqye appearances. I like it you can see on a model which sort of armor it wears and what weapons it holds.

Undecided:
- Some more information would be nice at times. The tutorial is quite informative but a little more explaination about how combat works would have been apprechiated.
- Loading times. Pretty darn long. I guess this is where refills and bathroom breaks come in. Mitigated by the lack of loading once a mission starts.
- Difficulty settings: I like it when I can decide myself at what difficulty I play. Yes, you can (ussaully) decide to stick to 'normal' missions but it'd be fun too if you once in a while were the stronger gang on paper yourself.
- I am not in too far so maybe this still is to come but I'd be neat if there were engagements with more then 2 gangs involved. 2 weaker gangs ganging up on a stronger gang? Yes please.

Nay
-Only four types of gangs! I realise the studio is small and adding new gangs costs a lot of time but I for one wouldn't mind paying if some gangs were added as dlc's. Gimme orcs! Undead! Elves! Dwarves!
-All games being Ironman can be heart rending when you lose a valued member of your gang. Not seeing what your taking out members of other gangs results in is a bit dull. Why can't member be captured?? I'd be nice to have some sort of league idea where 64 gangs slug it in Mordheim in a Blood Bowl tournament style. Then it's fun to cripple an opposing warband.

Despite some nays I still think all in all the game is quite worth the bucks you pay for it. If you like turnbased strategy and warhammer fantasy then Mordheim is defenitely a game you should try.",True
"Not exactly a long game, but a lot of fun. The gameplay is very different to most and is quite a bit of fun, although some of the interesting mechanics only get used once or twice, which is a shame.

It's also hard sometimes when you have to force a tragedy on someone in order to save someone else, but that's part of what makes the game good.",True

"I first checked this game out almost half a year ago when it was just released as early access. The optimization was very poor, but I felt like it had some promise due to the amazing atmosphere. However, I felt like they needed to improve a lot gameplay wise for it to be successful.

Fast forward to now (almost release time), and it seems to me these improvements didn't happen. Although the optimization is much better (runs okay on my older hardware), but the gameplay is almost the same.

The experience is like this: you sneak around for a good 10 minutes scavenger hunting for some clues. Not much happens. You finally find the monster, kill it with some cheese tactic, then walk off the map. Not much happens. Profit.

OR, 1 out of 10 times, you get shot in the back while you are fighting the monster, and you lose. 

So my basic problem with the game is that most of the time you just sneak around, no action, and maybe nothing interesting happens the whole match. Leveling up the characters, and the danger of losing them is a total gimmick, no one cares, the abilities are lack luster. The only thing matters is your overall bloodline level, which enables you to buy more powerful weapons. The characters are totally replacable. Once you reach max level, I'm not sure I would care about bounties and XP, what would make me come back is fun gunplay, but it's just so rare.

I don't know how to improve this game, but as it is, it just falls f lat. It's a shame",False

"Fun Tales game for the little time I've played, somewhat different to the others but still feels like a Tales game.
There is a new system which works like a fighting game in terms of combos, no more normal attacks, everything is an arte now which is still fun.
The only ""problem"" the game has is that there will be times when all you do is walk or having to talk with some characters for an hour but this isn't a real problem, even those moments are fun because of the great character cast, even when you are walking for a while the characters interactions are so good that the game won't feel heavy thanks to the skits, (for those who don't know what those are they are like little stories between the characters) and those add a lot of character development and makes the game a lot better in terms of history.
The game is fully voiced, both in japanese and english and the voice actors are really good.
The gameplay is good overall but I have one complain, there's no option to pet the dogs.
Gameplay 8/10 but since you can't pet the dogs I give this a 2/10

--

It's not often I get games when they are not on sale; this being one of the rare occurrences.
I do not regret the purchase.

Even with all the hate this novel gets for having content [18+ scenes] removed or censored [with a towel], I think it's worth picking up. Of course, you'll want to patch it for the original scenes anyways, but its still pretty good as is. Check out the guides in Steam for patching instruction.

What I like:
+ Felt connected to characters
+ Plenty of feels
+ It is quite long; I clocked 50 hours for the 1st path (I read slower than most people)
+ Very detailed; With the amount of detail they give, it has me very engaged with each scene
+ Art; There was more art than I was expecting to be in a VN. In silly scenes, they even have an entire style of drawing
+ Voice acting; There is voice acting [in Jp] for all characters except yourself. I like the quality of it
+ Sound assets aplenty; Whether it be characters talking, or a pen dropping, there is sound. Much more lively than other novels I've read
+ Music is catchy; I ended up getting the sound track

- Translations are derp sometimes
- Grammar is incorrect sometimes
- AO content removed [see the guides in Steam to restore it]

**With the latest update of a new map and mode, many bug fixes and performance improvements, the game is much improved! I REALLY love the new map, very well designed. It is a perfect time to get on this game now that new maps are coming out!**

After almost 30 hours on the game here are my thoughts!

Great game that gets better with each update. Wonderful gameplay, some of the best audio in all of gaming and is just a real blast to play. Get a few friends and get ready for some fun coop action!

Could use more maps (although the 6 that are here are fantastic) and more improvement to bugs/performance, but I trust these devs to deliver post launch, as they always have in the past. Pick this up now!

This has the best close quarters fps combat around imo. If you combined Insurgency Sandstorm's close quarters combat with arma/dayz's long distance combat/big maps, you'd the perfect shooter for my tastes :)

Intense atmosphere, fantastic audio, great gameplay, awesome level design, this game is a blast! These developers are quickly becoming some of my favorites, up there with Obsidian, CD Projekt Red and Bohemia Interactive as my personal favorites these days.

Improved in literally every single aspect from the last game, other than performance and bugs which are improving each day. If you liked Insurgency and Day of Infamy, you already know what to do!

With promises of more maps, guns and updates over the next handful of years, the future looks very bright indeed for Insurgency Sandstorm.",True

"If you loved game like ABZU or Journey, pass your way, this isn't one of those. It's one of the dullest narrative/poetic game I've experienced. I can see the sincerity that went into this, but the clumsiness washed it away for me.

The entire gameplay consists of pushing your Left Stick forwards from one light to the next, through immense and empty feeling levels, untils your thumb hurts. Sometime you have to jump and try not to laugh at the jump animation while the narrators try to make you sad. None of this is ever fluid or engaging. At every light or landmark, you get a piece of story. It's a pretty unsurprising sad story told by good voice actors (I mean no offense if it's inspired by real life events, just talking about my game experience here). I could have liked it if I didn't have to run an marathon of emptiness between each new plot elements. Every time the narrators stop talking, you find yourself with your stick pushed forwards, staring at the game emptiness and absolute lack of any kind of interactivty. How disapointing. The ending was surprisingly decent enough but not worth the pain of getting there, by any means.

You'll find pretty looking environnement here and there, some of them definitely worthy of a screenshot, but the game is inconsistent and most of the time you'll look at empty terrain and clunky vegetation. In any case, graphics are not aw-inspiring enough to compensate for the dullness of the rest. The game simply doesn't give me anything to chew on and to inspire me to keep going. If it weren't for the 80% positive review I would have stopped in the first minutes. Cannot recommend this unless you have never played a video game before and you like fox so much that you don't care if they look sort of ridiculous and irelevant.

[b]Conclusion:[/b] The game has a kind hearted message to share with us (even if a pretty trivial one tbh) and it somewhat succeeds to do that with some of its dialog lines and some of its best looking scene. But making me running around as a fox in what looks and feels like a student project, didn't help in any way to deliver that message to me.",False

Well written, over-the-top action, great gameplay, and an absolute steal for $4.

The downside of this game is that it takes up a lot of time, I can only play it during the summerbreak and the holidays. Still a lot of fun if you manage to get a small town set up.

"First things first....I LOVE this game....but I don't play it enough.

For a game that resets your character every time you die, Dead Cells manages to make every run fresh by implementing a very intelligent upgrade system and excellent combat mechanics. Both of these things are the reason you will come back to Dead Cells for years to come.

The art style is also top notch, calling back to metrodvania games of old while taking advantage of new technology. Dead Cells is proof that the old ways can still produce masterpieces.

Did I mention that I love this game....?

"This review is entirely based on my own experience with the game, it may not represent the current state of the game (last played April 11 2020), comments are welcome if this has changed and I will gladly update this review. However at this time I have taken a break from this title.

I wanted to say yes I recommend this game but I just can’t, this feels like a massive step forward in aesthetics and graphics which I will say the game looks and sounds amazing, but four steps back in playability, I remember picking up X2 and X3 and just being able to play it, the game told me what I needed to know and I took it from there to grow my empire and lay waste to the galaxy… picking up the smaller nuances of the interface and command system later, eventually mods claimed hundreds of hours of time on X3 (XTC you glorious creation you)… 

But… Since I purchased X4, I’ve played not even 3 hours (about 2 hours 44 minutes), because each time I’ve started a new game, it feels like your dumped on a station with minimal guidance despite all the changes to the game you’re on a station and you need to get to your ship but it didn’t tell you anything about where your ship was initially, updates have fixed that it seems… When I last tried there was some element of a getting started which took me from station to ship and undock but got stuck at go to this nav point… I went there and nothing happened. I restarted, the same thing. Reverified game files and tried again, the same thing… I was stuck… so I went back to old faithful… X3… started a new game on Terran Conflict, and was away again… played for nearly nine hours that day alone… 

All in all, I think X4 has prospect, but the obvious issues I faced even getting started have really tarred the experience, especially after the disaster that was X Rebirth… which I regret buying so much… as its never worked beyond 90 minutes of play a key mission was just broken in that too… a trend that seems to be a consistent issue for newer X games…

"Surprisingly I have never played a Tomb Raider game before in many many years of gaming so didn't have a reference other than a few snippets from reviews.  Bought this along with a bunch of games I researched based on high rating during the summer sale and it was a great purchase.  The combat is not as smooth as some other games I purchased at the same time, but still very good.  The puzzles were great.  Overall I can't say anything negative about the game other than I'm sorry I finished it already!  Definately recommended.",True

"If you guys like the original, you will love this. The creators really put alot of effort into this. This has more interesting levels and has more new enemies, weapons, and different powerups. You no longer have to choose perks to use, you just have to upgrade them and its potentially possible to max them all. However, while theres no difficulty in level mode, it does get harder as you progress through.

To balance this, theres these tokens called ""Revenge tokens"", its useful if you are in a impossible scenario. When you reset the level, you will have the ability to regenerate, which makes a big difference on your playthrough. Use it wisely, as its limited. But its possible to find them through the levels.

Just like the original, this game requires simply 2 buttons. There are some new objectives as well comparing to the original. There is also new modes you can play from, survival mode is still around if you are still interested. This game has a big improvement and I truly enjoy it. I totally recommend it.",True

"When the game was still new I was willing to pay the price for the main game and a few dlc. Generations, pets, supernatural and seasons. Later also bought a few others.

But the game has always been buggy. Even after 11 YEARS EA refuses to fix problematic dlc like island paradise. I get that after some time their interest went to sims 4. But there are still years between island life and sims 4. 
EA seems more interested is selling expensive dlc for long periods of time than delivering decent games. Unless it is a soccer game,

"I mean, how many separate times can a game dissapoint you before you just have to write the negative review, my god. I was lucky enough to not have purchased the game when it first came out, I got to witness the collective dissapointment from the outside looking in. 

However, when I found out this year that they had released a patch that made the game ""playable"" and ""close to what they originaly promised"" I thought to myself, this could be what I've been waiting for. I bought the game and upon booting it up, waiting exactly what I found myself doing, 22 minutes of waiting whiel the game was loading shaders to be specific. But not to worry, a quick google determined that this was a common problem with an easy enough fix, which I followed, and low and behold I was playing the game. 

I played for a solid hour and a half before heading off to bed, and as life went on around me, I never did come back to the game that I had waited for. Until today, today I was excited to jump back in and realy push through into the massive universe of No Man's Sky, but after a few minutes of loading shaders with a loading screen frame rate of 4fps, I realised, I just cant be assed with this game.

It was clear from release that there may be issues, but it breaks my heart to see that to this day, still, the game just doesnt seem to want people to enjoy it.

EDIT:

To clarify, I did play, and enjoy the game, but the fact it bugs out every time I try to boot it, and not specific to just me.",False

"I have to edit this review after playing more... the game has gotten a bee in my bonnet (so to speak) because of a nifty little feature it's got: When you tag an enemy and hover over them it tells you a small snippet of the person's life. They were a cobbler before. This one is an expectant father. That one likes setting people on fire. ... I liked it at first, but the more I play the worse it is. The guy who likes killing people wrote a touching letter to his daughter in case he dies and how he's sad he won't see her grow up. There are letters from home about how monsterous the brits are cause their bombs killed their son, or their neighbors...

I bought the game for the uncomplicated heroic fantasy of sneaking around and headshotting Nazis, not to be told that there are very fine people on both sides. I'm not gonna say 'keep your politics outta my gaming!' but they really screwed it up here... or else they really wanna portray the Nazis as the real victims of the war. Which is just awful, I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt and trust that Rebellion is a team of doofuses and isn't filled with Nazi sympathizers.

I know that life and war are filled with grey, that a person can be a monster to some people but hug his kid and love his dog, but the game's writting and mechanics aren't equipped to deal with a complicated narrative like that. And besides, WW1 was a much better setting to fill that sort of story. All this feature is doing is making the game feel less like a heroic war story and more like a serial killer fantasy that takes place in an alternate reality where Nazis are AWESOME! 

Screw you Rebellion. 

Sorry to harsh your buzz, it's just really really creepy. I'm still gonna give the game a recommend because if you can look past it trying to humanize the Nazis you just shot it's still a really fun game.",True

"So many options given to the player in this game. Thumbs up!

Edit - I think I wrote the initial thoughts at around 20-25 hours in during late Early Access. Even at that time the game had so many systems and mechanics that worked together, and worked in some way even when you tried your damnedest to break them.

It's been 13 days since the full release and I'm sitting at just about 100 hours of the game played. My character is an Elven Conjurer. I can eat body parts of some of the deceased to gain memories that might give me clues in quests, or just amusing (or often times discouraging) views into their life and or death, and even some skills and spells some times. I can conjure an Incarnate Champion who's elemental buffs/resistances are dependant on what surface I conjure him on (Blood, Poison, Fire, Water, Ice, Electricity, Oil)

I can sprout wings to quickly manouver the battlefield, or Medusa snakes from my head to petrify my enemies.

The game caters to how you want to play both in combat and outside of combat. I hesitate to say a concrete number, but so many of the combat encounters in the game can be avoided or talked out of. Likewise, you can end up talking yourself INTO combat often if you don't watch what you say and who you say it to.

"[h1] [u]Yakuza Kiwami Review[/u] [/h1]

Amazing game. I love all the games and recommend buying them.

[u]Pros:[/u]

- Amazing graphics.

- Great story-telling (Better if you played Yakuza 0).

- Fun and addictive combat.

- A ton of content for 100%.

- Outstanding Soundtrack.

- Majima is everywhere!!

[u]Cons:[/u]

- The lock-on system is annoying as hell.

[spoiler] I love Kiwami but the story is just not as interesting and gripping as Yakuza 0. But the continuation of Y0 in Kiwami is really well done. R.I.P Nishiki [/spoiler]

Play the game straight on Hard if you prefer playing games with a good balanced difficulty. Normal is way too easy in Yakuza games and thus I would say go into Hard straight from the start like I did.",True
"Thanks to the amazing work of the community, the Tabletop Simulator (TTS) is a all-in-one package where you can play almost any physical game out there. I had a bunch of fun with it, especially during this pandemic, when there was no other alternative to play boardgames with friends.",True
"I owned all the old Roller Coaster Tycoon games and was always a huge fan! When this game came out I was SO excited but also unsure about it because it looked too good to be true. I was so pleasantly surprised- the game was everything it said it was advertised to be and more! 
Yes, there are some bugs- but I can't think of any game on steam that's being updated constantly that has zero bugs. And the bugs are honestly nothing, whoever is complaining that the bugs are making the game unplayable are completely exaggerating... And yes, you have to have a good graphics card/computer to run the game smoothly because there is SO much you can do in the game and SO much detail! Which I absolutely love! 
This game has endless possibilities; you can be so creative, and if you're not so creative, you can easily get other people's artwork to put into your park. My personal favourite way to play the game is in career mode- where you have to strategize by slowly building up your park with your hard earned in-game money. If that's not your forte, you can just play sandbox mode to not worry about the finances. 
This game is the perfect mix of somewhat a strategy game and a building game and if you like either of the two, I highly recommend it. 
Another great thing is that the developers are constantly fixing the little things and release big updates pretty regularly, so the game continues to get more detailed and awesome content.

"This game is very good if like me you love Survival horror games. it might be a bit buggy at this stage, but it's a Early Acces game after all. Building mechanics and the whole concept of building your own base, Fortress or just a plain house are pretty good, even though there ain't that much to build yet. And with the newly added steam dedicated servers it is very easy to play with friends so that's a huge plus. I recommend this game highly to everyone who like Survival Horror genre games even a bit.",True
"This is a great prison building game. You can choose to create a humane prison or you can create one akin to some modern day prisons where you treat your prisoners terribly.

There are bugs that popup every so often. I, personally, haven't experienced any ""game-breaking"" bugs but I have experienced some that are pretty annoying and that definitely get in the way of the vision of a prison that is being built. Thankfully, murgh, has created a DevTools kit so that you can fix many bugs on your own as they appear.

This game uses Paradox's launcher to start the game. The launcher is worthless but there are some people that whine and cry while claiming that it breaks the game. Those gripes are simply not true. The launcher doesn't interfere with the game except for having to click an extra ""Play"" button to start the game. If you're resuming a saved game then the Paradox launcher allows you to get into that game even faster than the old non-launcher.

It's a prison builder/prison simulation. You receive prisoners and create their daily routine. You decide how much food they get each day. You choose which types of prisoners that you want in your prison (min, medium, max-security or the additions of SuperMax and Legendary prisoners). You buy your staff and have them perform tasks (you can micromanage guards and cooks to a degree but you cannot assign them to very specific tasks). 

For more actual pros... the game is well-polished except for the occasional bug that pops up as stated above. There's quite a lot of customization that has been added. You can choose the look of your walls, doors, floor and more.

I wrote a review for this game just to combat the whiners in the forums. Paradox decided to delay their DLC because of the current situation in the world with the police reform protests. A bunch of right-winged authoritarian boot lickers didn't like that very much and got very very fussy about it so they started writing bad reviews during their temper tantrums.",True

"I heard that William Gibson, one of the founding authors behind cyberpunk went on a twitter rant to ridicule how this game supposedly  looks like a GTA mod or something and is not cyberpunk at all. Well you would be wise to listen to the man, that is if you also think that the best cyberpunk movie ever is Johny Mnemonic, a movie starring a professional potato Keanu Reeves in the role of a walking USB flash drive (that was installed into Keanu's brain, replaicing the part that is responsible for displaying any kind of emotion). Also featured are the neverending night, fax machines and modern VR technology. Anyway, in just a couple of years we will be able to see how accurate this movie predicted the future, as it is set somewhere around 2020. So far we are almost there, with the explosion of the VR technology and the resent resurgence of fax machines. We only have to wait for the president Trump to ban the sunlight in the next few years and viola, we can enjoy our own cyberpunk adventures right here in the shadow of the local Walmart tower under the watchful eyes of Amazon's patrol drones. I personally will be long gone before that happens as I plan to sneak on board of the first manned Mars space ship in order to use my superior lack of moral principles to take over the new colony and become the first planetary emperor ever. 

My point is, this game has too much sunlight and is in first person view, which sucks. I was expecting to spend 30 hours in the character creator to recreate my personal ideal of feminine beauty: April O'Neal from 80's TMNT, then over the course of the game completely reconstruct her into a shining chrome future robot lady from the art of Hajime Sorayama. Well let me tell you that not only there is NO yellow jumpsuit in the customisation options and no way to install artificial chrome torpedo tits, the game is also in the first person perspective! How am I supposed to enjoy my state of the art waifu simulator? For these reasons alone I cannot reccomend Cyberpunk 2077 for anyone except those fortnite-loving dabbing kids who are apparently the default target audience of the current gmaing indusrty I guess. 

Anyway, it seems that I've been writing this review on the wrong game, but after putting this much work into it i guess I might just finish it with relevant critique:
+ No sun.
+ Neon lights.
+ No first person perspective.
- No yellow jumpsuit for the heroine.
- No chrome torpedo tits.

"[b]Vulnerable, realistic characters ground Tomb Raider's thunderous action, keeping it from becoming a mindless excuse for violence.[/b]

Let me begin with a warning: this game is brutally graphic. Sometime when you screw up you're subjected to a short, gruesome death scene. Even when you succeed you might find yourself stumbling through caverns strewn with corpses and pools of blood on the floor. Yet if you can stomach it, it ends up adding to the grisly, extraordinary struggle for survival that tries and tempers a young Lara over the course of this game.

This iteration of Lara is a compelling one. Since this is an origin story, at the beginning we see her unsure of herself at and terrified when things start going all kinds of wrong. At times her compatriots need to encourage her, other times she is driven to fight for their wellbeing and still other times they butt heads with her. Gradually, as she overcomes the challenges she faces, we see her grow in ability and confidence. The actress and writers did a great job of making her feel like a real person. She's more than just a standard action hero killing machine given a female facade.

Voice acting for video games in today's age of mo-cap has become much more of an involved process. Yet Tomb Raider proves that the talent in this industry is greater than ever and up to the challenge. Camilla Luddington as Croft is the obvious star and shows a broad range of believable emotions. Robin Atkin Downes' depiction of the character Conrad Roth exudes a fatherly, gentle confidence that steadies Lara early in her journey. Another highlight for me was the palpable desperation of the ship's mechanic, Reyes (portrayed by Tanya Alexander), to survive and get back home to her daughter. 

The main acting I didn't care for was for the character Samantha (Sam), who oddly has two actresses credited to the character without distinction for who is responsible for what. She came off as a little flat to me. There's also a point where she voices a letter written by one of Sam's ancestors, yet she hardly alters her voice at all. To a lesser degree I also wasn't too enthused with the writing and acting of the character Doctor Whitman. Neither Sam nor Whitman are distractingly bad, they simply fall short of the excellence of the rest of the cast.

Crystal Dynamics has made a game that is visually stunning, living up to its AAA status. One memorable instance was looking out at a deep blue smoke signal rising in the distance that contrasted wonderfully with the tattered reddish-orange banners intermittently placed along my path. All this taking place on craggy, windswept rocks and ruins overlooking a hazy blue-gray sea and sky. Awe inspiring set pieces and soaring vistas abound amidst this chaotic journey.

The character design is on par with the environments, including Lara who is just a beautiful as ever and with more realistic proportions and clothing to boot. It's worth noting that the graphics option ""TressFX""  gives Lara's hair its own exaggerated physics processing, but it is very taxing on computers. The only time my frame rate stuttered was during close-ups of Lara's face during cutscenes, presumably because of TressFX. You may get better mileage by turning it off and increasing several other settings instead.

This game's third person shooter, cover based combat isn't particularly original but it's polished and largely satisfying. I appreciate that in most cases (but not all), the enemies seem like they plausibly could have been stationed where you encounter them, rather than being spawned in purely for the sake of throwing combatants at you. Melee attacks are limited to single strikes and dodge counters, indicating that you are expected to mostly rely on your weaponry. 

You are able to upgrade those weapons by scavenging scrap, encouraging you to keep an eye out for collectables as you explore. Lara also gains skill points used to unlock new abilities, which combined with the gear upgrades lends a nice sense of progression to the game. Many of the hidden collectibles have a historical significance that makes this island feel truly inhabited. As you seek them out you'll uncover pieces of this island's wondrous past. There are also numerous, optional, puzzle centric tombs to delve into. On the exploration side of the game, I could have done without the ""mash E"" type quick time events that are used for turning cranks and prying open doors and chests. The QTEs tied to the action do a good job of keeping you engaged during the more scripted parts.

Speaking broadly about the story, I liked that it kept me guessing on what was real on this island and what was myth. While it is a little predictable in other ways, it was more than adequate to keep things moving and allow the other aspects of this game to shine. The pacing is excellent, never letting you get tired of one aspect of the game. You'll be driven from one fantastical event and locale to another, with time for cutscenes, character building, exploration and shootouts along the way. My first playthrough, which was about a year and a half ago, took 18 hours and included getting all collectibles and achievements. My recent replay lasted about 9 hours while getting roughly 75% of the collectibles. For this genre I would consider this a pleasantly lengthy game.

"Very fun and hard at the same time, but it makes you thrive to want to beat it.",True
"This game is fun and even a little unique, but not a great game than everybody should buy. It stands out from other zombie shooters by its looting ans searching mechanics. You find weapons and ammo that randomly spawns in different places and with different loot. Weapons are limited in number as i believe there are only 11 (not 100% sure on that) but at least the weapons are varied and behave differently and are not just bigger versions of your pistol. There are also items that unlock new areas that are used to progress through the map like keys and boltcutters. The ammount of open buildings in outdoor areas is poor as there are only a couple open buildings. Maps do change in structure which is a nice addon which makes it more varied but can make the game harder early on looking for key items.

Now the most important part in zombie games, the zombies. Their ai isnt that impressive and even gets caught on double doors even though 1 door is open. They move slowly but can do some damage if they get close. Large groups are a garunteed death if you are alone and go in loud. But, a really nice things is the headshots, they are awsome and some of the best i've seen. 

This game isnt bad exactly but its has problems, but if you think you will like it your probably will. Buy it when its on sale as $20 is a little expensive if your unsure.",True

"I played this game both before its enhanced edition update came out and after. Most of its horrid encounter design has been washed away. No more instant murder swarms of regular spiders, no more 36 STR wererat rogues. The combat in this game has been so revamped and redesigned it is virtually indistinguishable from a heavily combat heavy tabletop session (excepting the CRPG standard of many, many more enemies to fill out areas that would otherwise be empty). But now with a half decent party you can progress through the game without abusive and boring levels of SaveScum.
The story was not bad, not super deep or incredibly compelling, but companion quests can be fun, and the voice acting is solid. Some moments are a lot more compelling than others. Secret ending is probably the best, but there are a large variety of endings for different storylines. 
The kingdom Manegment is actually OK to good now. The only times it get overloaded is right before the end of the game, with 20+ event cards. But your supposed to just go deal with the main plot at that point, so it mirrors the P&P Adventure Module. 
Wide assortment of items, lots of different companion combinations, can make your own custom companions (best done early rather than latter for gold cost).

On top of that, why do developers keep passing off this low quality trash? Do you ride a horse for transportation? No, you drive a car because its 2018, so stop making this old, crappy, worn out, fake nastalgic garbage",False

"This game is an okay sequel. It uses the exact same bad guys as the first game plus 3-4 extra units. The guns are the exact same, except you get skins this time. The map is much bigger, but it's the same repetitive script as the first game. There are also spots in the map you can get stuck in or behind walls, forcing you to die and restart. Like the first one, there is no way to adjust the music volume or sensitivity that I can find. Overall, it was about an hour of playtime to beat all levels. 

The massive number of trading cards and achievements is definitely an appeal, but for the 7$ price tag, I cannot recommend getting this game. It should be 99 cents or less. Buy it with a coupon or on sale in a bundle if you must have the achievements. If not, don't bother at all.",False

Other than that, very pretty and vivid graphics, awesome storyline with interesting characters and plot developments. It's also not the longest story in the world, which I personally like.

"(Note: i got this game at an earlier time. This means i not only got it for $15, but i was also one to experience the game's development)

I hate how ""fans"" of this game always seem tp go back and give the game a sh*t review just because they have a bad run. Never mind how many hours of fun you have had, this bad dungeon run just makes me want to rage. If you want to know a general idea of the game here is a summary and some pros and cons

So this game is actually similar to Pokemon mystery dungeon in terms of gameplay and similar to Bastion in terms of atmosphere. You select four heros with a maximum of 4 usable abilities and a total of 7 abilities to choose from to explore the cavernous depths. Along the way you fight countless unique enemies, gain stress, quirks and diseases and investigate curios.

Pros
Atmospheric- This game has a narrator that parrallels with the one from Bastion. The designs of characters and enemies are very unique.

Experimentation and endorphan rush- It feels great when you finally manage to comprehend all the factors within the game and start to really experiment with party combinations to find out your ideal party along with other things like finding out the right items to put into curios to get great effects or when you land that crit on a boss.

Cons

RNG- At worst this game is an educated gamble. Every attack has a weighted significance becuase that one stress dealing attack may help to afflict your character at a later stage. It doesnt help that this game has more rng than what is expected

Grinding- For me this wasnt a problem as the experimentation with different party composition and trinkets was what i was engrossed in but obviously i know some people wont like it.

I think i love this game so much because it reminds me of a game i used to play as a kid and it expanded my horizons to look out for dungeon crawlers i love this game.

Also i wanted to point out a few things because i really hate people putting it in their reviews

1: Corpses CAN be turned off (YES There is an option in the gameplay section of the escape menu). But idk y u would want to do so. since heros have restrictions on where they can hit, having corpses allow enemies to keep within an area where such hero can hit

2: Certain stat quirks e.g: Accuracy is capped @ 90% and enemy's dodge also plays apart in whether u hit or not. If you want to understand stats the link to the wiki is here

Also a few tips for newcomers

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEzFegh6uWA",True
is k,True
"Like buidling things? Want to be a martian god? Don't like pulling your own hair out? 

If you answered yes to any of these you will need to skip this game. Take your money elsewhere, maybe even donate it to your local space program, as that will get you closer to space than this 'game' ever will. 

Not really sure what the point of this game is. You mine rock, hap-hazardly make a room, fill it with things that never get built. Then watch the cat walk around. Come back an hour later, cat hasnt moved, you wonder if its dead. Could go on for ages writing why you shouldnt buy this product, but wouldnt it be funny if I spent more time writing a review on this game that actually playing it? What a trip. Seriously, dont buy it.",False
"Just love this re invention of the classic Thief.  The prologue is a little slow but does an excellent job of aquainting players with the main game and developing the story.  Once the game starts proper, it is amazing.  So good to play a proper sneak em up again.  Refreshing to know that if you have to actually fight, you will die. None of the invincible hero stuff that fills most games.  Hide, run, sneak and hide again etc. 
Needs a reasonably high end pc, but its worth it.",True

"HITMAN: ABSOLUTION REVIEW

BY LUKE REILLY For a game built upon the concept of slipping by unnoticed, Hitman: Absolution is certainly doing the opposite. It’s standing conspicuously amongst today’s fad-driven modern shooters and me-too multiplayer hopefuls, middle fingers extended. A slow-paced, single-player focused sneak ’em up, Absolution looms in stark opposition to many of the most pervading trends in gaming today. It cares not for the overly delicate, their minds rendered dull and flabby after years of being prodded through corridors blasting anything that breathes. Absolution delights in letting players skulk through it expending few bullets at all. It’s a game that wants to let you think for yourself.A game that wants to remind you that trial and error done right equals satisfaction, not frustration.
For those of you counting at home it’s been 2368 days since Hitman: Blood Money was released, give or take. That’s a long time between drinks. It’s nearly six-and-a-half years. In video game terms that’s somewhere in the Cretaceous Period. In actual fact the besuited Agent 47 and his barcoded dome have spent the vast bulk of this generation on the sideline. Hitman: Absolution has been a long time coming, a fact fans are acutely aware of.The pressure to deliver, then, is high. Blood Money may be a dinosaur in some respects but it remains a cult favourite adored by its faithful fans. Six-and-a-half years on the team at Io Interactive must ship a successor to it worthy of the wait.The good news is, they have.Above everything, Absolution is a game that wants you to experiment with it. It refuses to be rushed through, rewarding brains over brawn. It wants you to spend time inside it, methodically picking your way around and discovering morbid new ways to snuff out your unfortunate marks. Like Blood Money before it, your targets here can be executed in a host of ever-so-slightly sickeningly different ways. Returning Hitman fans won’t settle for a simple bullet to the back of the head; they’ll immediately be on the lookout for the tell-tale signs of a classic Hitman kill opportunity. Some of them are more subtle than others but, like Blood Money, they’re all there, waiting to be discovered. A couple of the game’s kills are more tightly choreographed for dramatic effect, complete with a brief cutscene of your deserved victim sucking in their last breaths, but most of the game’s kills – two dozen of them at least – are traditional Hitman fare. How you take them out is in your hands. This is a slow-paced, measured experience. This is not Medal of Duty: Modern Warfighter Ops. Impatient action junkies need not apply.The way Absolution itself plays is very much a refined version of what Io attempted with its previous effort, but gone are most of the quirks Hitman diehards were happy to overlook in Blood Money. 47 feels far more connected to the environment rather than skating about on it, and successfully sneaking up on a target from behind with your signature fibre wire is no longer quite as fickle an exercise. It’s all a lot more organic and a lot less stiff.Furthermore Absolution adds a host of additional abilities for 47. 47’s limited use sedatives, for instance, are no longer necessary because of his close-quarters combat skills. Sneak up on an enemy or NPC unawares and you can grab them and either subdue or kill them with your bare hands. It’s just like Blood Money, where you could simply take people as a human shield and then knock them cold with the butt of your pistol when your syringes ran dry, only without all that rigmarole (although, of course, you can still do that too).There’s a cover system that allows you to properly exchange fire with enemies when things go pear-shaped, rather than being stuck out in the open desperately strafing left and right. When you’re playing as you should, stealthily and patiently, the cover system is even more useful, allowing you to spring from behind it as enemies pass by to quietly choke them out, or snap their necks. You can also fake surrender too, disarming your would-be captor and taking him hostage.There have been tweaks to the shooting system too. Point Shooting, which is a slo-mo power-up that functions not unlike a similar power-up in Splinter Cell Conviction, works fine but Hitman veterans will almost certainly never use it outside the couple of instances it’s required throughout the game. Rabid Hitman fans simply won’t be doing the levels of indiscriminate killing that would warrant the use of Point Shooting. You can’t get Silent Assassin ratings by mowing down scores of henchmen in slow-motion. Better is Precision Shot, which allows you to gently squeeze the trigger to steady your aim before actually firing. It feels very natural; it’s a hugely better solution than the normal “click-here-to-hold-your-breath” malarkey.Then there’s Instinct Mode, which is basically 47’s intuition represented visually. Instinct Mode remains a true bone of contention for some but at its most fundamental level this replaces the previous, god-like minimap. 47 can sense nearby enemies and you can note where they are in relation to him. How you use it beyond that is really up to you. New Hitman players can use it as a crutch, noting enemy patrol paths or objects of interest. Veterans can simply refer to it sparingly or dial it down entirely. On the higher of the game’s five difficulty settings it’s automatically neutered anyway.On the topic of difficulty settings, there are five – and they cover the whole spectrum. Easy is exceedingly so, and Purist is insane. The sweet spot for a first play through is probably Normal or Hard. Enemy reaction times are quite forgiving in Normal and the game will tolerate some sloppiness on your part at the expense of realism, but it’s a good setting to build up an understanding of the levels. Hard ramps things up. It’s interesting to note that enemy NPCs aren’t just sharper on higher difficulties; there are also more of them. Depending on your approach you may well find your undetected route through a level on Normal completely thwarted by an added patrol on Hard.When things do go sour the adjustments to how enemies react to your presence is also welcome. If you’re spotted and you can contain the situation by subduing or killing all nearby witnesses before they inform others an alert won’t be raised. This is a refreshing change from Blood Money, where one foul up would dispatch every enemy on the map against you like heat-seeking missiles.Absolution looks good. There’s arguably a bit too much lighting bloom, particularly when harsh light begins to glint off 47’s cue ball bonce, but it’s not going to be something that’ll have you dropkicking the disc down your driveway in disgust. It’s darker and grittier than Hitman titles past but the visuals shouldn’t raise many complaints. It looks its best at its busiest; when you’re threading your way through the game’s thick crowds. It’s these moments when you’re keenly aware you’re playing something a little different. The levels are nicely dressed and the cutscenes are well-produced; it’s a solid effort all around.It sounds great too. 
There are 20 levels but many are broken up into a series of stages. The key difference between this and Blood Money is the levels are segmented. Instead of one big level, say, like the Heaven and Hell Club, levels in Absolution are often completed in discrete chunks. For instance, there may be one or more areas that need to be stealthily navigated and passed through before you can reach the area [...]",True
"[h1]Celeste: Beautifully frustrating[/h1]

Celeste is a single player indie platformer about the character Madeline who embarks on a journey to Celeste mountain in order to climb to the top. Along the way she meets many colourful characters and discovers something about herself. Each character oozes out personality and charm (especially Theo) and they are all perfectly utilised throughout the game as outlets for Madeline. As mentioned, this game is an indie platformer with a bit of a unique take on it as the main character, Madeline, has an ability to dash one time allowing her to reach places that simply jumping wouldn’t allow her to. This works extremely well and feels very satisfying, especially when combined with the grab mechanic making it feel very fluid and free moving. However, after a while I found myself getting slightly tired of it as there isn’t a whole amount of variety throughout leading to me getting a bit bored around the temple stage. The soundtrack to Celeste is top notch and utilises it very well in order to add to the dramatic or heart felt moments throughout the game. But the best part of the game for me is its message, it has a clear and deep message about mental health as Madeline suffers from depression and anxiety, even a dark form of her being the main antagonist for the game. It is expanded on throughout the game at different dialogue points where she discusses it with Theo, giving the player an insight into her thoughts and feelings. It is such an important message to display to people and I think it works perfectly in a game about conquering the mountain but also yourself. This game is hard, not extremely hard as some people have mentioned but still hard. You are going to die a lot of times, especially towards the end. Most of the difficulty in the game does feel fair and isn’t over the top, however there are some moments where it feels a bit cheap, at least in my opinion. Finally, the game is a tab bit short, but I do feel like it couldn’t really go on for any longer as the gameplay was getting slightly tiring at the end.
Overall Celeste is a brilliant and fun experience that has a deep and important message to tell.

"     Another great entry to cult classic series of games. This is Momodora at its very best. Its a solid metroidvania that take about 4-6 hours to complete on normal. As far as metroidvanias go, its unremarkable except for the fact that its gorgeous. Seriously, everysingle movement and attack looks amazing. This is without a doubt some of my favorite pixel art ever. 
     Combat is challenging, fair, and satisfying just as it is in all Momodora games. You don't have to play any of the previous games to enjoy this one, as none of them are directly connected. That being said, the first two games are freeware and I highly recomend playing the second one if you are at all interested.

"An unforgiving isometric zombie survival sandbox game with realistic elements. Realistic in such a way that cooking requires the exact ingredients and the right temperature. Making bread dough for example requires water, salt, flour, yeast and a rolling pin. Perishables need to be refrigerated and cooked food that's stored are better eaten hot by reheating it with a microwave. The cooking aspect itself with multitude of recipes is one huge subject matter besides other skills like carpentry, farming, vehicle repair, electronics, etc.

You can choose different classes ranging from fisherman, construction worker, policeman to several others each with their own unique skill sets. A fitness instructor for example has the ability to identify nutritional values of foods and the right amount of sustenance required. There's traits that contribute to your overall stats. A -4 negative trait of being a smoker for example will mean that you're allowed a +4 positive trait to balance it out. The abstinence of cigarettes will of course effect the character's mood. I find that these traits add more realism and personifies the struggle of an ordinary survivor. Weather, fear, hunger, sanity, fatigue and overall state of mind impacts the character in certain ways.

I was a little skeptical at first because after all, it's a game about cars but it was highly recommended to me by a friend so when I built my first PC I decided to give it a try. I AM NOW OBSESSED! It's never ending fun trying to improve your own skills and work with teammates to grind to those higher ranks. There is also an awesome trading community which I love. It's so much fun to try and collect the best looking and rarest items. There are so many fun gamemodes which are all hard to master but can be really fun. 

CONS: People in this game can be kind of toxic. Scratch that VERY TOXIC is what I meant to say. Sometimes you will have nice, competitive matches with respectful players but other times (at least at my skill level) there are players who wont hesitate to make fun of you with the very sarcastic chat commands. When I first started this made me question if I really did suck at the game because 75% of the time I would completely whiff which is actually normal for new players I later found out. Don't get discouraged when people spam you with What a save! when you miss the ball or Nice Shot! when you score an own goal.

"Kenshi is a open world sandbox RPG style game. In essence, it is a game where YOU determine what you will make of it. You can do and become almost whatever you like also allowed in game but it won't be easy! It won't be easy because you start as nothing (there are even worst starts then this if you mod the game!!!) and therefore you must work and battle your way to become something in the Kenshi world. 

In other words, it is a world that is filled with characters and creatures who either don't give a damn about your existence or worse they care enough to try and steal, kill or eat you alive, literally in some cases!! So be warned you won't have plot armor to save you at all and you will have to give yourself personal set of goals to strive for and achieve.

"Not the masterpiece it was hyped to be, but still an insanely excellent game.

The story is great and came close to making me cry a couple of times.  The humor is a bit inconsistent in how it meshes with the story though.  Sometimes it can make an emotional/serious moment come across as a little odd, other times it blends really well with those moments and makes them stronger.  It's easy to get attached to any character you meet really and all of the characters are portrayed in a grey/neutral light which I really like in a post-apocalyptic setting personally.

The combat is good and the party members you meet all feel unique in their abilities.  The animation for combos and skills are all really nice and fun to look at (especially Rage Ironhead's LUCHA combos).  The game isn't too challenging, but it's hard enough to put some pressure on the player in key moments.  Mutants are designed really well and are actually pretty intimidating to fight.

What really surprises me about LISA though is the music.  In all the talk of LISA I've witnessed, nobody ever mentioned the music.  This shit is fucking excellent and really creates a sort of unique atmosphere during fights and during exploration.  it gets you pumped up in different ways or it creates a sort of wary, uncomfortable feeling that you probably won't like (see all the mutant fights).

Overall I'd highly recommend this game to just about anyone.  I really don't know who wouldn't like this game, it's just all around a fun and emotional ride.",True

"I will start by saying that I very much appreciate cyberpunk as a genre and that >observer very much ticks all of the cyberpunk boxes. Gritty urban setting? Check. Ethically questionable technological advancement? Check. Said technology making one question the nature of reality and what it means to be human? Check. Main character a law officer in the position of upholding a status quo which he is brought to question? Check. If you are looking for this sort of story and happen to be in the cyberpunk mood then >observer would be for you. For God's sake the developers got Rutger Hauer to be the main character. How much more cyberpunk can you invoke? 

If you are looking for engaging gameplay and visually appealing set pieces, this is not the game for you. Most disappointing for me were the sections of the game meant to be emotive and scary. They rely heavily on very trippy and dark psychedelic imagery to tell the story of the victims which you jack into. I hit my limit when I walked around aimlessly in a constantly shifting office building full of nothing to interact with wondering what the hell I should be doing. The visuals didn't make me unnerved or scared. They made me frustrated and confused.  I must be emotionally invested in the story to be scared and this is where the game loses me. As much as I like Mr. Hauer, the game just mostly makes me wish I was watching him in Blade Runner and not in a video game whose game design is point, click and listen to dialogue. I did that in the 90s. Thanks.",False

This has to be one of the most fun games I have ever played. The players make this game so great with the roleplay or just the fucking around aspect is great. Everyone is having fun and not being negative. The game is pretty similar to how war was back then. I only think I dislike about this game is the melee. The melee is pretty trash but also super satisfying when you get a kill. Actually it is satisfying killing anyone because it is pretty difficult to hit people. Also when loading into the game sometimes it freezes so you can not get the class you want right away so that is kind of annoying because rifleman is the best class and it is always full. Anyways this game is super fun and worth the money in my opinion. I overplayed it a bit so I do not play it as often but coming back to it once a week is always a blast.,True

"Summary: Even more waiting and more RNG
Multiplayer: No
Completion: 19 hrs (previous experience)
Cards: Yes
Cloud:Yes

Kingdom: New Lands is the sequel to Kingdom: Classic and is bigger in scope in every way. Much of what I said for Kingdom: Classic holds true for Kingdom: New Lands as well, but there are quite a few changes that need to be addressed.

First of all there's multiple stages this time around. The victory condition in this game typically involves rebuilding the ship (around 50-120 gold) to sail to the next island (up until Skull Island). You may ferry over a handful of troops and builders to the next island, so carry what you can, because you'll need it. 

This game is significantly more random across the board. With all the new additions, only a portion of what is unlocked will appear on each playthrough. This may lead to some unfortunate farming trying to get what you want to bring to future islands, as surviving later islands becomes much harder without the aid of some specific tools, such as the baker. The worst is when you lose the crown, and you have to start over from scratch farming islands. The fields are even larger this time around. There can be up to three portals on each side, and terrain is widened. It can take more than daytime to traverse one side.

Destroying a portal does not immediately send swarms flying out from it. Now it causes a blood moon for the next two cycles, usually spawning breeders for later portals. Enemies are all the same types as before, but breeders are more problematic than ever. It's not uncommon to see three, or even four of them clumped together rampaging through your fort. There are some new useful tools such as the ballista, but even that might not be sufficient. With all the randomness and beefed up enemies, I found myself dying much more often in this game than Kingdom: Classic.

The graphics are virtually the same as Kingdom: Classic, with new additions of course, and that's perfectly fine. I wouldn't mind if all sequels used the same engine. The music is also largely the same, and has that iconic soothing quality. The game is hauntingly beautiful to look and listen to.

More than the first game, this one needs a way to speed up the passage of time. Moving the boat along takes days, possibly weeks to get it to the pier, and if you have total map control, there is nothing to do but wait. The game pauses when out of focus too, so you can't go do something else while waiting. I could also use an option to reset unlocks as a way to control what will never appear for me, or if I just want to start the game fresh.

Aside from the excessive waiting, and an almost total reliance on a certain hermit, I had a lot of fun with Kingdom: New Lands, and I much appreciated all the new content. I rate Kingdom: New Lands an A-. Kingdom: New Lands as well as Kingdom: Classic are perfect time killers. I always have fun when I start them up, and by the time I win or die, much time has passed.

Tips for myself in case I decide to play again in the future:
[spoiler]
- You can unlock items quickly by finding the signpost, then immediately lose the map. Quitting will not work.

- You can and should leave portals on one side alone if you know where the dock is. The time and resources it would take to fully clear the map are not worth it.

- First island has no portals on the side with the dock. There is no build shrine, so you cannot build and take knights with you here unless you started with them or find a knight hermit. Focus on getting off the island quickly ~10 days.

- You can bring a hermit and a dog with you between islands. Drop a coin on the log to free the dog (there will be no coin indicator). The dog barks in the direction of greedling assaults.

- Bakers are almost a necessity, as many later maps put vagrant camps extremely far away, past portals. Bakers are unlocked on Island 4. If there is no baker on the map, keep playing island 2 or 3 until one there is one.

- Thanks to the baker, you will never need to expand past your first two walls. When sending knights across long distances, escort them and drop coins on them if a night assault heads their way.

- Hermit structures are built by fully upgrading an archer tower. Put the hermit on your mount, then pay to upgrade the tower one more time.

- Unicorns provide 3 gold whenever they feed, and warhorses can run amazing distances without tiring. Either will serve you well.

- You can fit more than two knights on a boat if you have the knight hermit or if you carried over previous knights and they survived.

- On Skull Island, locate the Archer and Builder statues ASAP and use them when you can afford to. Cliff portals here regenerate after three days, so destroy both of them in a short time span of each other to win. Always bring a baker here, and preferably a unicorn.[/spoiler]",True

"Played this game together with my girlfriend on stream and it was lots of fun!

The story was nicely written and the twist at the end was very unexpected and super cool.
The game is not that long, I myself took 119 minutes to finish it with my girlfriend.
The puzzles were quite challenging, some were easy to solve, some took quite a while (chapter 3 do be hard).

You think it's not a game against the time, when in reality it literally IS a game against the time.

The graphic design was very pretty and the atmosphere was kind of chilling and had a creepy vibe to it but don't be scared, you do not have to await jumpscares in here.
The audio was nice and the sound effects were nice and detailed. There is not a lot of real background music, only atmospheric sounds, which did their job quite well.

My verdict:

A fun co-op game to play in a world where these kind of games are clearly missing.
It's a very nice story driven game about time itself and it truly is lots and lots of fun to play together.
Teamwork is exactly the key to win here and you will be facing quite a challenge together.
My rating will be a 8/10 considering that it cost me 2€.

I can only recommend playing this game with your friends and family, you will have a very nice time.

"Shooter with almost no rpg elements and an incredibly shallow dialogue system. Pretty decent story and a base building customization mechanic that you can lose yourself in, however it falls incredibly short of being worthwhile due to there being no co-operative play. You can build a giant amazing base, but it's gonna be a huge mansion where one lonely person lives.

Like almost every game in recent memory that markets itself as an RPG, it goes through the motions and gives you your checklist so that you can tediously check off all your boxes with all the excitement of watching grass grow. Being a Bethesda game running on the skyrim engine the bugs are annoyingly abundant and incredibly random. No surprise to anyone who has played anything from Bethesda in the last decade, you know what I mean.

All in all, get it if you want. I spent over 200 hours in it and can't say I enjoyed it, and can't say I didn't. It just... was. Bland, tasteless food, but still food.",False

It does take a bit of effort to get it working just right, but once you get the hang of it, it's really easy to swap games, music, movies, etc. Beyond that, it does a great job of capturing the feel of being in an old arcade. The lighting, the carpet, the machines, the mix of music and arcade cabinets, things littered around, and the included arcade games. Even if you don't have VR, but do have a love of arcades, this is easily worth a buy.

"So when I was like 10 I remember playing this game called MechCommander 2 on the prehistoric family desktop, and that game blew my mind. It was the absolute best and it captured my imagination. Now, fast forward a good number of years, and I see this game called BattleTech pop up, and I was like, oh snap, das it. I was so excited to relive my childhood that I immediately researched the game to see if I should get it. Now the only thing that held me back was that it was turn-based combat, which is something that I personally hate. But after awhile I decided that I needed a good offline single player game to travel with. So I bought it, and boy was that a good decision. I absolutely love this game and everything about it. It is probably not for everyone, as it's not necessarily a slow pace, but's it's not real time, so be warned. But if you are a fan of big robots, big guns, and strategy, I would give this game a 10/10. The management of your starship, crew, and mechs is also super good, the amount of places you can go is just stupidly large, and I got 100 hours out of the campaign. Now, I do definitely take my time with a good campaign, and you could totally beat it way faster, but if you like to explore around and get the best stuff, than I'd say you too could get 100 hours out of just the campaign. AND THEN THE DLC CAME OUT, and I got another 100 hours out of all of that, because I enjoyed playing it the first time so much I bought the season pass. I did wait for the season pass to be on sale, because it is a little pricey, but other than that I'd definitely recommend all the DLC as well.

"Not a perfect sequel to season 1, but I do feel Io has done a lot to give us a great follow up. 

Going by mastery as a meter, we get a full episode less of content, and they just copy/paste the old prologue, but we get ghost mode and snipe assassin as a trade off. Plus there are expansions already in the works, so I imagine this game will be larger than the first when it's all said and done.

The biggest downside is the cutscenes. Instead of the gorgeous videos from the first, we get a series of still images with dialogue dubbed over. But they do feel longer as a trade off, so I'm not complaining. 

The levels we do get though... Amazing. The maps are huge and expansive, but don't feel like they are made up of as much wasted space as we saw in Sapienza. And I have to say Whittleton Creek is probably my favorite level of either game.

"Ah yes, FS19, the buggiest big-budget farming game you'll ever experience.

Not only are the controls extremely fucking clunky, and the hitboxes are absolute trash, the game in itself is boring without someone to play with.

Along with this, the multiplayer is buggy.
There's a train in singleplayer, where is it in multiplayer, why can't I use it?

Along with this, there's several bugs present in multiplayer, one of which being the fact that the terrain doesn't load in properly, meaning floating machines and livestock, and your player falling through the ground.

There's also night-time, which is extremely, extremely dark, to the point where you can't see anything unless you change the settings of your monitor to the point where literally anything else will completely blind you.

There's lots to be desired here, the game feels empty, and the fact that you can't use mods in multiplayer without having to rent a server or host it yourself, which for me and my friends isn't worth it since we don't play often enough to warrant it, is to be honest, completely idiotic on the developers part.

As for the AI, it's improved alot from previous versions of the game, but it's still completely braindead, to the point where a 6-year old could do it better, it's not that fucking hard to back the tractor up and turn it around WITHOUT hitting the other one that's standing 20 meters from the field.

The building system is a good addition, it makes it feel more like you're controlling your own farm, and that's a good thing, but the fact that you can't place the buildings anywhere except on your actual fields, despite you owning the area you want to place it on, is completely fucking braindead.

Not only are the controls fucked, the steering feels like it's made up of cardboard, rubber bands and glue. It takes 5 solid seconds of holding down A or D for the machine to even react.

As previously mentioned, it feels empty.

In FS17, we had solar panels and wind turbines built in, where are they now?

We had lots more machinery and things to do, where is that now?

----------------------------------

I get it, you need to push the game every year, just like every other big budget studio to get the fanboys to steal their parents credit cards and go buy it, development isn't cheap, but come the fuck on, atleast put some fucking effort into testing your game, and don't release it when it's less than half empty of content.",False

"A Hack'n'Slash game (Diablo2, Path of Exile, Torchlight series) - except your fighting greek monsters & legends.

Start as a generic hero (male or female) and decide your class through skill mastery trees.
You unlock the first mastery tree at the start and second one later in the game, however skill points aren't refundable in the early game and so players need to becareful when applying points.

This game is multiplayer online with sessions supporting 2+ players.  It also supports voice-chat which can be disabled by pressing 'P' ingame and muting players; additionally this is where you would invite players to your party.
Just like Diablo 2 the difficulty increases with increased players.


My first impressions were mixed at first but when I unlocked my 2nd mastery tree I found at that point in the game that my abilities began to differ from other players making the experience alot less generic than at the start.
This game does feel like its aged but it is also refreshing to see lots of options in terms of skill masteries; just don't make the same mistake as me and apply multiple points into a skill before you've played with it abit as I imagine this game doesn't like respecing very much.",True

"The first player is good, but much much much too short. I pre-ordered, thinking that the DLC would be worthwhile, but NOTHING adds anything more to single player. It's like a long tutorial.

I beat it relatively quickly and enjoy the single player as a walking simulator now. If they could make GTA Online suck less, make it easier to just play with only your friends - might be worth more, but can't really recommend it.

The online play you can start with friends and only friends, but the map is like a loading zone - you can wander around but the actual events you WANT to do as friends, completely disrespects your initial online settings, throwing you into a random server with strangers who more than likely suck at being decent people.

"Really nice 3-D models with the Crimsonland twin-stick gameplay. Level design is somewhat strange: small with destructable obsticles. An odd mechanism where you get a giant robot after picking up enough mechanical parts.

In fact it is very light on the story, after the intro, which really disappointed me. Anyway, I am have had some good fun with it, although it sure feels repeatitive after a few hours. Unlocking new perks doesn't make it feel much different.

"I've enjoyed my time spent on DayZ although I haven't played it in vanilla, only modded servers. 

Gunfights in this game feel intensive and exciting. And while it can be unforgiving dying in a couple of hits, often not knowing where from, It makes me want to run back and seek out revenge. I love the manual loading of ammunition and gun mechanics that slow the gameplay down without it being irritating.

At times the game has pissed me off with such things as glitches where an item has become stuck in my hands, and I'm unable to swap it out or drop it. There are also times where I am geared up and become sick or dehydrated, and then search through many places to find water or medication to help, but I'm unsuccessful and end up dying. Maybe I'm just not looking in the right places.

"I bought this game on July 1, and have been able to log about 9 hours of play time so far.  My first impression was a bit scary because as soon as the game launched for the first time, the screen went black and sat there for about 2 minutes, then my PC went into a loop between loading the first production splash screen in a window frame, and then back to a black full screen.  It did this for about 5 minutes and I couldn't even get to task manager long enough to kill the program.  Eventually I managed to time an ALT+F4 correctly and the program closed.  Given this is an ALPHA release, I figured that maybe it was just a resolution detection issue, so I gave it another try.

This time the game loaded, but it took a couple of minutes to get to the load screen, whose resolution was at 1024x768.  Given that I'm running a GeForce 770GTX I poked around in the options and set it to 1980x1024 with everything at the maximum available settings.  Not all options were actionable, but again I suspect this is due to ALPHA status.  The graphics are beautiful on this game, and for me, the framerate hasn't dropped for even a moment thus far.

As for the gameplay itself, I found the first few minutes of gameplay to be lackluster because I was really expecting some sort of tips on how to move, and what the various keyboard keys do.  I had seen in videos that (i) was inventory so I pressed it and nothing happened.  Upon examination of the key mappings, I found that the (j) key is journal, and spacebar was blink. I found that the journal and inventory (crafting) panel don't unlock until a little later in the game.  The intro is hand drawn sketches, that I suspect will be a cutscene animation at release.  I'm hoping that at some point they make the NPCs mouths move during voice-over events.  Presently the character models just stand there closed-mouthed while the voice-over audio is playing.  Again, this is ALPHA, so I am just hoping they are working on this immersion breaking aspect of the game.

After I reached the point where the blink ability tutorial popped up, I thought something was broken with my spacebar or the game itself because the 'charged' blink wouldn't work.  It wasn't until much later that I discovered (via experimentation) that the default unattuned defensive sigil disables charged blinking.  When you create a new defensive spell, you can create one that either disables quick blink or charged blink, or galvanize... or at least that's what I've found thus far.  Fortunately, the charged blink isn't really needed until you reach a canyon with a chest on the other side of a broken bridge in the underground cavern.

The crafting system is very cool, and I suspect that with the right spell components, you will be able to customize your spells to your own play-style.  For me, this is a tremendous feature because I might like to go a different route from the norm.  So far, I've been greatly enjoying the use of mind controlling a monster, debuffing the enemies and letting the pet go to work on them.  I love the AOE Lightning with a 7 second stun that adds 'stored' damage upon critical, combined with a targeted chain (arc) lightning spell is incredibly powerful, but can be the death of you if you aren't playing strategically.  The AOE I created gives the enemy haste when the stun wears off, but it is worth it, usually.

I love that you don't have to just blow things up if you don't want to.  There are so many ways that you can progress through this game that I cannot wait to unlock the next tier of spells.  If you enjoy a challenging linear progression across a map (with the occasional excursion to optional areas), and releasing mayhem upon your foes, then this game is definitely worth a look.",True

"Positives:
-Mechanics, aesthetic, and theme harmonize tremendously well
-Innovative position-based combat system
-The art and sound design manage to create atosphere and punch out of minimal animation
-The stress and death's door mechanic do entirely what they are meant to do
-Very well balanced
-Wayne June's voice
-Earns every bit of the anxiety and tension it demands
-Weird note, but the ""timing"" of all the sound cues and animations is absolutely perfect (actions hit suddenly, give you just enough time to process the possible consequences before revealing the result to relief/despair; it's never boring or confusing)

Negatives: 
-Some wonky UI elements (taking torches from the first, not the smallest, stack; Not being upfront with duration of buff skills; Very poor information about enemy attacks)
-Wiki-dependent (why not collect curio and enemy information, and Darkest Dungeon maps, in an in-game encyclopedia that exapands as you encounter the subjects?)
-Some character classes have intriguing abilities and build possibilities that lack complements from the other heroes (I'd love a reliable front-line healer, or for the houndmaster to be able to use stress-relief from position 2, or for the arbalest to be able to heal every position; you're probably going to end up taking a vestal/occultist and jester/crusader on near every run for reliable support, which feels like a lot of wasted opportunities)
-The Darkest Dungeon levels could be rebalanced. The 2nd might just be too punishing.
-There is sometimes too much temptation to cheese out an encounter for heals in a way that breaks the atmosphere
-Each hero class has only one sprite with different pallette swaps.  It's a more developer-intensive thing to address (if you add more characterization, you have to animate for all of them), and may even have been an intentional design choice, but still is noticeable at times for it's repetitiveness.

***
Darkest Dungeon might not be for everyone.  It's not for those who want to charge through a game before getting to the next one.  It's not for those who are easily frustrated by setbacks or some bad luck.  You will go on lots of missions, lose heroes you spent lots of time building up, and have pivotal moments go against you at the worst time.  But for those who enjoy the core gameplay loop, it won't feel like a grind, and the stakes and unpredictability reinforce the core appeal of creating meaningful, stressful choices for the player to tell the story of their own playthrough.

Darkest Dungeon is my favorite game of the past year.  It's a quirky but elegant game that uses a near-perfect collaboration of several disparate elements to create exactly the sort of emotional response it's going for. You'll notice that the negatives above are more specific than the positives.  Well, that's because when the overall package is so well put-together, the small blemishes are easier to articulate.

The basics: You have an overworld strategy element (the hamlet), where you recruit heroes, upgrade them, and so on.  You send these heroes into various areas on expeditions to map out areas, kill bosses, etc.  You have to buy supplies for the expedition, so inventory management is one key part of the game: Do I take the shiny treasure if it means dropping survival equipment that might net me a greater return if I keep going long enough to make use of it?

Inside the dungeons, you'll have many combat encounters.  The basic system is a turn-based one that is position-dependent.  Your heroes have skills that can only be activated from certain ranks (it just stacks you and the opposing party in lines) and can only target enemies in certain positions.  There are a few strategic elements that this opens up.  First is that, since you can only take four combat skills per hero at a time, you have to balance maximizing their ability from the position you prefer, and having options if they get shuffled out of it (which can happen in a variety of ways).  Second is that it means that a single character class can have different behaviors and builds based on where they are supposed to be in your line-up, which makes for some interesting variety (and stressful decision-making, when you want to have it both ways).

Then, you have the death's door mechanic.  Death is permanent and there is only one auto-saving slot per game.  However, reducing a character to 0 hp does not kill them right away.  Instead, it puts them on ""death's door"", a weakened state in which any additional damage has a chance to kill them.  Even a 1 hp heal gets them off death's door, so they're ensured to survive one more shot.  This creates some very tense moments as you pray that your heroes get to go first and get that crucial heal in before the potential death blow comes in.

And finally, you have stress, the mechanic that might most make Darkest Dungeon the game it is.  Characters don't just have health points.  They also accrue stress from things such as traps, enemy abilities, critical hits, etc.  Stress can be alleviated by killing certain opponents, landing crits, allied abilities, etc., but if a character's stress hits 100, they have to make a virtue check.  If they fail (which is the majority of the time), they take on an ""affliction"", some devastating personality defect such as Abusive, Paranoid, or Hopeless.  These are stat debuffs, but more importantly, also take the character somewhat out of your control.  A character might skip their turn, or hurt themselves.  Afflicted characters can actively refuse others' attempts to heal them, and their negativity causes stress to their comrades.  A failed stress-check can quickly snowball and doom an entire expedition, so managing it is key.  Otherwise, a character can get to 200 stress and have a heart attack, which puts a character at 0 health and on death's door, or kills them outright if they are already there.

This blends with the global strategy element because, while healing physical damage is free, you have to spend gold to fix stress levels and afflictions, or remove negative personality quirks that stressed characters develop.  You're put in a position where you constantly have to evaluate whether to invest a significant amount to get a decent character back in fighting condition, or replace them with a newbie (for free).

Darkest Dungeon succeeded in punishing me for cherishing my characters, and encouraged me to play in a more cold-blooded way than I normally would without literally forcing me to.  But the incentive isn't so overwhelming that I don't still get attached to characters.  And no matter how much I try to protect certain heroes, a few cruel rolls of the dice mean that no one is ever truly safe.

I got to a point where I simply did not want to continue.  Not because it wasn't fun, but because I was just too anxious about the possibility of things going wrong.  I researched ways to save-scum, and made back-up files in case the worst happened.  But I never used them.  It never felt justified.  The game is harsh, even cruel, but refrains from pitching into the absurd or unfair (usually).

There are so many great things going on that it feels weird to acknowledge that none of them could make the game on their own.  The narrator's voice (the incomparable Wayne June) is always enjoyable even after it gets repetitive, but in a lesser game it would just be a detail.  The graphics aren't AAA, and aren't trying to be.  The sound is good.  The mechanics are sound.  But the reason they make for such a good game is that they all drive toward the same purpose and theme.  From the quirk mechanics to stress afflictions, to the degree of rng, they all reinforce the Lovecraftian themes of madness and futility in the face of incomprehensible horrors.  It just works.  It's a delicious experience that really shows how much the design team cared about and understood what was special about their own project.",True

"Okay, let me start this off by saying I highly prefer SoC over CoP. The reason being is quite simple:

In Shadows of Chernobyl, you are a Stalker trying to make their way through the Zone with a simple task: To kill Strelok. If you want to, you can completely ignore the story and just carve out your own path doing Stalker-like things. On top of that, the Zone herself is fairly dangerous and desolate, and in an odd way, fairly beautiful as a result. However, in Call of Pripyat, you're no Stalker. You're military. You know, those guys forcing Loners to pay just to pass through Cordon without getting shot. You're -pretending- to be a Stalker just so you can safely find out what happened to some downed helicopters, and that honestly ruined the experience for me right off the bat.

I really tried to like this game since it's still a S.T.A.L.K.E.R title, but that one little fact really soured the milk. Maybe I'm being petty, but after fighting against the military and seeing my fellow Loners get gunned down, I can't just switch sides. Especially since I prefer to role play while spending a few hours in this setting. And yet, here I am giving this game a positive recommendation, and that's all due to mods.

I've tried Misery, and as much as I loved how it made the game considerably harder, I got the feeling attempting my first playthrough this way was a mistake, so I'm back to vanilla for now. However, not too long ago I learned of Call of Chernobyl, and holy hell did that save this game for me. Add to it the add-ons from DoctorX (Questline, Faction Relations, and Dynamic Faction Relations), and I'm now going through what I had hoped this game would have been. I'm a Stalker again. I'm a Loner. My motives are my own, and I do what I must to survive. That is why CoP still gets a recommendation from me.

...Oh, and speaking of CoC, I'm currently in a playthrough in which Duty and Freedom have declared an alliance.",True

"I played this game in my childhood even before I got it on Steam.
It is great to play for a few hours and to sink into the Star Wars universe is a great feeling honestly.
While the graphics have grown a bit out of date this by no means makes this a bad game at all.

"The main campaign of Mirror's Edge was roughly 6 hours. The gameplay and visuals were beautiful and fluid, however the story didn't make much sense. It was jumbled, the backstory didn't serve much purpose introducing you into the world, and you were left feeling confused. The game comes down to running away from people shooting at you, and they are bad because they are shooting at you. I recommend this game for the gameplay and visuals, but it would make more sense to not pay attention to the story. You'll be less confused that way. Overall, 4/5. Worth the price if it's on sale, but not full price.",True
"[b]Overall I'd say a good game,[/b] probably around a 15 hour story if you ignore all side quests or content. A fun story with some twists and turns along the way that for the most part aren't exactly surprising or original but do keep the plot engaging and fun. For reference, I played the game through on its hardest difficulty. I would recommend that you turn off white paint markers and tomb/direction hints as I feel this makes the game too simple, with them off you do actually have to study the terrain.

[b]The voice acting and lines can be great[/b], but sometimes are delivered a bit flatly. Lara on side quests occasionally resorts to one or two word sentences delivered in a dull tone, especially near the end. If you choose to listen to the native tongue of the final village, a lot of the lines from side quests are delivered with no emotion at all particularly by children who sound more like they're struggling with the language rather than fluently speaking it.

[b]Most of the main characters are well developed[/b] with the main enemy, Pedro Dominguez, being someone who wants the same thing as Lara but ultimately wants to use a different route. Lara's sidekick, Jonah, supports her even in her times of self-doubt and gets in on a little romance and bromance action. The only main character who really stands out as completely undeveloped is commander Rourke who remains ""bad army man"" throughout the whole game with no further development. Even then, no-one really changes during the game. No-one, other than Dominguez, is anything more than black and white/good or bad.

[b]Graphically the game is very impressive.[/b] Even without RTX shadows the game looks great: lighting is well done and the villages look great and have character to them whilst also being full of little details. Jungle locations have good vertical detail with lots of canopies, trees and rock walls. The only time the graphics let themselves down are when you get to see long sight lines and you get to see the textures on their own with no vegetation. This only happens a few times so I am nit-picking.

[b]General movement is fun[/b], although sometimes Lara is prone to doing dumb glitchy stuff. The wall climbing can be engaging, especially on the harder difficulties which remove the white paint forcing you to look where you need to go (although sometimes the game doesn't make it exactly clear which parts of the wall you're able to grab and which you aren't). The variety of ways you can move through the environment is fun to watch Lara carry out. 

If there's one thing which could be fun to see is more technical rock climbing rather than climbing on obvious ledges or using picks. Making use of hand holds and body weight to climb could be more interesting to watch.

[b]Combat[/b] pretty simple to master. Just land headshots and most things die. Use C to dodge, spam heals and resistance and you'll be fine even on the hardest difficulty. Every now and then you get caught out, but generally it's pretty easy. Out of all the combat sections, the one I enjoyed the most was where you only had a knife as it actually forces you to use your brain and make use of the stealth mechanics which you never need to do any other time since you can just blaze your way through most of the time. 

[b]Map navigation[/b] is where the game takes a massive turn for the worst. I don't know why but your mouse locks to every single random thing on the map making it nearly impossible to just pan around. The maximum zoom on an area map before you go to the overall map view is too close, there needs to be one more jump between the two. Also, side mission markers disappear in the campfire warp map which means you need to check the main ""TAB"" map then go back to the campfire map to figure out where you actually want to go.

[b]As far as upgrades go[/b], there are some fun skills. For example, the ability to assassinate an opponent and then drag them up into the branches of a tree. Or put a booby trap on an enemy's body. Skills were more interesting to acquire than weapon upgrades which just applied flat damage, accuracy, etc upgrades rather than providing a new way to play the game. Outfits are a nice way to change the appearance of Lara and in some cases could actually change the way you play the game. Prefer to be stealthy and you can choose parts that improve stealth, want to a front-line fighter then take ones that reduce damage taken and if you need resources you choose ones that increase loot pick-up rates.

[b]Getting resources for upgrades[/b] and xp for skill points isn't particularly hard. This will especially be the case if you take the time to do some of the side missions and don't mind backtracking sometimes to get more resources. By the end of the game you'll probably be full on most of them, even in the case that like me you haven't completed all side quests or farmed for materials. 

I would almost argue that there may be too many resources for healing, focus, endurance, etc effects. For healing you could let each enemy in a stage injure you to critical health, heal and still have enough to do the same at the next stage. At the same time, I felt more inclined to use them because they are so abundant so it's a win;lose situation depending on how you view this. 

I suppose I need to address the main reason for the games title, [b]the tombs and crypts.[/b] I would go as far as saying that all, if not the vast majority, of the tombs in this game offer something fun. Not of all them push you that far, being relatively simple and with an obvious enough solution. On the other hand, some can be a challenge due in part to me turning the paint and tomb hints off otherwise they probably get pretty easy. Every tomb provides a beautiful environment for you to solve the puzzle in with the underground ones especially having light streaming in through cracks in the roof or walls.

If you like puzzles, you're probably not going to find anything too challenging with a few exceptions that do make you think. 

[b]To sum the game up[/b], it's fun and easy to play. Especially with more of the hints enabled, such as tomb hints and paint markers enabled, it's an easy-going experience that doesn't push the boundaries in any ways but does everything either very well or well. The only thing that really ruins the experience is the terrible map but it's only one small part of the game as a whole. Literally the perfect game for just sitting back with a controller and relaxing as you wonder through this world.

I feel like the overall environment puts you into the world much better than previous titles, which was kinda supprising. I really enjoyed the improvements made to the combat (finally), enemy ai, and ui/bartering system (it is much easier to navigate and view values). Again, all the complaints are mostly by people who just wanted another New Vegas, which is fine, but they need to see F4 on its own. To sum it up, it is a decent RPG, fantastic world to run around in, and fun post-apocolytic simulator. Get it maybe on sale, it can provide houndreds of hours of enjoyment.",True

"900 hours played in early access. Loved the game. But once the game released it was so riddled with cheaters I had a cheater in EVERY game.

Game is currently unplayable due to the massive amounts of cheaters. Don't buy it!

Update: 

Game experience worse than in early access, developers taking it in the wrong direction. Anticheat fucks with client performance but STILL tons and tons of cheaters with aimbots.

Also vaulting added made the tactical skill ceiling lower. Crouch jumping was more fluent.

 Long jumping removed.

 Scopes all made worse. 

Game is constantly blurry. Removed options to edit gamefiles to fix client performance. 

Addition of FPP divided communbity, shouldve stayed with one mode IMO (doesnt matter which one to me, but FPP?)

Game spatial sound is wank since release. Cant hear distances properly or make out from where sounds originate in the 3d space.

They added meaningless lootboxes and skins. Adds nothing to the experience.

Still a laggy mess.

Still chinese wanks everywhere on every server :(

Input lag still bad.

Tickrate still 15 or something.

FPS drops still, even with a billion dollar setup.

Vehicles, which were fine altered to the worse.

Things to find are a distraction which you should leave when they are. Unfortunetally, at a moment of completing the army, you will be forced to grind for the purpose of making it stronger.

Apart from the obvious ""Bigby is a f*cking badass!"" comment, there is a lot more that make this one helluva Telltale game. Strong characters, brutally difficult decisions (though yes, as with all Telltale games, your decisions really don't mean as much as they make you think they do), gripping storyline and character interactions/relationships, some kickass action sequences, great cast of voice actors and well-written dialogue. It also looks great with it's noir, comic-book feel. You can play it regardless of if you've read Bill Willingham's Fables or not and love it either way (it 100% does justice to the comic).

The gameplay is top-notch (be warned that the joystick detection might not work, as far as I'm concerned I had to use Joy2Key), the jumps are precise and the level design feels great. There is a lot of variety in levels, ennemies and bosses, and each victory feels rewarding.

"[h1]Cancer Strike: Global Diesese[/h1]

Skins are shit.
Community is complety shit (the worst in my live, not minecraft, not call of duty - well, maybe LoL has worse, but it's cancer too - but CSGO community is the worst in all online games).
Shotting model is shit (It's a shame to call this something FPS).

Nice to see, that many kids are creating their Steam accounts and only game is Cancer Strike (but no, hell no, 1.6 or another like that, just Global Diesese, coz ""It's popular now"") or have more games with less than 10h, but csgo has above 999999999999999999 hours played. Of course ton of PAID textures (which are called ""skins""). Everything is just going down since The Arms Deal Update (yep, that was adding paid textures).

ONLY FUNNY WAY TO PLAY IS WITH FRIENDS (not ranked) OR SPECIAL SERVERS (like deathrun, surf, etc.)

I can't undetstand ""hype"" in this game. Every time this same map, same tactics (ranked, community servers are fine, mostly) only ""random"" and ""unique"" thing is who kills somebody. But the best is people, who's buying expensive skins, but can't play (funny thing is if they sell this skins, they can be able to buy solid game) or ever if they can, it's the most stupid way to spend money (not rarely -Bo not their money).

I fell bad for every penny and every fucking hour spend on that cancer game.

"Me:
I am not by any means a multiplayer/fighting games expert and I have been casually playing fighting games since MK1 on PC came out. I enjoy playing single player stories and the arcade vs. the AI.

To me injustice 2 looks good on the first glance. The story mode is short and I completed it in one sitting on medium difficulty. Took me about 3-4 hours I think. Since I am not big on multiplayer and rarely play it I was very delighted with the idea of the ""Multiverse"" mode.
A single player mode, where you can have gear progression and level progression. Sounds good to keep you occupied. I started with the easiest tasks available for easy and medium AI that were on my gear level and always blew through them. After some time playing, getting my first character to 20 and having several epics with the according item level I started working on the more difficult tasks and gosh ... my verdict:

THE AI IS FUCKING HORRIBLE in this game for a casual player.
Why?
You either have tasks that are easy as hell and get you no rewards or you have tasks with for example 12 opponets and in this stack of opponents there is one with batshit AI settings you will find impossible to beat.
This one opponent will block 99% you try and will weak up instantly all the time, have full character powers at the start, and will just juggle you to death with every attack.
I am sure you can beat them if you are a very good player or have found somme cheap tactics on some chars, but if you are a casual player you will try and try and try on this last opponent because the loot is so nice and then throw your controller away in the corner because its 100% frustration.

For all the stuff Netherrealm has gotten right over the years (especially for single-player fighting game fans), their AI still needs a lot of work. It's not as ridiculous as it used to be, but they just can't find that middle ground between stupid easy and stupid hard. MKX wasn't too bad in that regard, injustice 2 is.

And because of that brutally frustrating single player experience I can not recommend this game unless its available for 20€ bucks sometime in the future ...",False

best RPG game ever!,True
"Resident Evil 2 is arguably the most beloved game in the franchise & in the opinion of some — one of, if not the best sequel to a game ever created.  To say that Capcom was under immense pressure when they undertook this project would be an understatement.  Thankfully, this game exceeded all of my expectations.

While there are jump-scares, the game relies more on a genuine sense of dread & fear that is usually lost with the shift to an over the shoulder camera angle.  This game won't hold your hand & reminds us all what made the series great to begin with.  There is not enough ammo in the game to kill every enemy so don't even try.  You will have to play smart & tactfully if you wish to survive.

Sound is a big factor in this game & while it is visually stunning without being a drain on your system — it is the sounds that you hear that will create an atmosphere of absolute fear & tension.  Each creature makes it's own unique noise & you will soon come to know them.  To be completley honest the thing that sold me on this game was finding out that with the deluxe edition of the game, you can swap out the new soundtrack for the original one from 1998.

If I had to find fault with Capcom, it is their refusal to hire back Alyson Court to voice Claire Redfield — a character she has voiced since the original Resident Evil 2 — the only exception being Resident Evil: Revelations 2.  Still, Claire's voice actress does a fine job — as does the rest of the cast.  It's a small detail but one that carries with it a lot of weight amongst the fans.

That being said — this title is a must buy for any Resident Evil fan.  I have enjoyed my time with it so far & I plan to spend many more hours in Raccoon City.",True

"Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!

This is a Retro RPG and you are playing a ""dark knight"", that wants to get revenge and destroy everything on his path!

[h1]Interface/Menu/Settings[/h1]

You can change the Volume of the Music and Sound.
You can choose if you want to turn on the Auto save function or off.
The graphics are like from a Gameboy Advance.
There is a dIfficulty Settings (Easy to hard).
Music is interesting.
You can play this game with a Xbox Controller.
Full Screen and window mode (However only in 1280x720 and 640x360)


[h1] About the game[/h1]

You will be locked up in the prison and start the game with a single Knife. 

There is a Story line going on with Drawing scenes and text balloons in-game. (So pictures that are hand made) 

There are Save stations in the game, You are able to save there. However you can load the game at any point you want.

You are able to save if you are outdoors (So not in village/dungeon/whatevr)
There is some Harsh language in the game.
There is a Quest journal in the game to help you remember things.

There is a monster log. (That tells you about their information, like how much XP, Gold, HP weakness, item drop etc).

You have a Mini-map in the corner, Things that you haven't seen or walked before will remain foggy. 

Monsters spawn on spawn locations even if you were there 10 seconds ago. But you have to go offscreen on that spawn.

Some Animations look sort of Dull/Lame?
The name of the spells are super creative. ""ice1, ice2, fire1, fire2"" and so go on. Not lazy at all...

[h1]Combat/Level System[/h1]

Combat is NOT turned based and you can walk/fight on the same time.
Some spells are able to hit enemies through the wall. 
Mana pool will be slowly recharged/refilled by itself.

There is a level sytem in the game and if you level up, you get 2 Skillpoints to spend (more points the higher you will be). Your health will also be fully restored.
But you can only place 2 points MAX in a stat until you level up again.

I Don't really think skilling the Vitality stat is worth it. It is only giving you 1 extra HP more. Intelligence is sort of ok, because you do more magic damage.



Strenght -> Increases damage.
Toughness -> Increases Defense
Vitality -> Increases Health Pool.
Intelligence -> Increase Mana pool and Magic Damage.

You are forced to spend points and can not save this for later purposes.


[h1]Other things.[/h1]

You are able to get the money drops on locations that you can't walk too. Use the attack button to get them. (This only works if they are nearby ofcourse).

If you need to farm a certain monster and you know where his spawn location is. Kill it and let his spawn location go offscreen. Then walk back to the monster and he is respawned.

Make sure you do not forget to save at save stations, You have to do this manually and will not be automatically be done. (Which could be confusing if you hear the sound after you have stepped on a station)

I will give this game 6/10",True

"I've got to say, this game hit me in an odd way. It's not a very long experience, and the gameplay isn't particularly challenging. I think I counted maybe two actual puzzles in the whole game, and you as the player don't ever get directly involved in combat. So if you're looking for something with challenging or fun gameplay you might want to look elsewhere. What we're really here for is the story.
You play as a being who finds themselves in a world unfinished by its developers, and are tasked by a mysterious voice to essentially mess with their progress and find ways to screw up their game. Along the way you find little notes and audio logs attesting to a messy 20 year long development process with multiple complete restarts, and which serve to flesh out the world outside your small unfinished game. While the story is very short (I completed it in maybe four hours) it is well written, interestingly told, and overall I found it engaging and fun to participate in.
This is the kind of game for people who were fans of Home Alone. The kind of people who are willing to let gameplay take a back seat to an interesting story.

"I bought this game expecting a fairly realistic and well designed single player game kinda like cod's story mode, and yes its got cool, working guns with cool, working attachments, but the rest of the game is kinda sub-par, im not totally sure what blew this game for me and ill still pick it up if im bored and can't think of anything to play in vr, but the fact that instead of putting a few well placed enemies around corners and things for challenge, they put literally 30-40 enemies at a chokepoint and just have you spray them down, then rinse and repeat for entire levels, really doesn't help me enjoy it, also for ambience and realism they will have the same sound effect of a guy screaming over and over and over, also the game tries to be serious, but also funny, but the humor is pretty much just ""haha he said the fuck word"", theres a mechanic where you can climb walls and other stuff, its really fun and I like it, but it doesn't really seem like the levels are designed around it, as alot of the time when you climb on a roof to gain somewhat of an advantage against the 30 enemies your about to fight, it tells you your leaving the combat zone, so you have to stand at just the right spot for it to work

"[u][h1]DISCLAIMER[/h1][/u]
    I don't play much visual novel or find any of them appealing to my interest in the first place, I've decided to give this one a shot after the recent controversy about a weird inconsistence steam censorship even though I do acknowledge that valve is just 1 year into their new publishing policy. So considers me a Novice reviewer when it come to reviewing this kind of genra.

[u][h1]Visual[/h1][/u]
    As a novice I suspect that a lot of people like me would compare this to Nekopara as the ""Catgirl"" being the primary reason. But I want to shove that aside as I haven't finished nekopara yet. 

-The drawing itself gets a pass, I have no complain about it. But expect a lot of background reusing.

-Dialog animation is quite shaky during transition possibly because the idling animation always move and they always play the first frame of the animation that has a fix initiate position. I also find quite a lot for character shaking to emulate the strong reaction/response.

-Voice actor did a pretty good job. Not a lot of high pitch whining for  for my 15% otaku standard. 

-Additional effect is average like pretty much VN.

 [u][h1]Story[/h1][/u]
    Nothing new like you would expect from average anime story writing, However I do like to criticize some tropes that writer implemented into the story, Not like I hate them but they are too weak to get invested. 

[b]Spoiler warning[/b]
[spoiler]Like when the writer had made both girl to associate with their [i]Hobby[/i] I use this term loosely Ayame for example who obsessed with game console is instant click and know how to play the game the very moment she touched the controller even though she has been exposed to it for the first time, The writer could do a better job playing with the trope for example how about making main character teaches her how to beat a hard game, That would be quite engaging also make for a better relationship or that time where the protagonist got a wallet and then return it to the owner, The message that the protagonist is a nice guy is too weak, I know that he is suppose to be blessed with good luck but how about make it more challenging or engaging even the first scene where the maidens demonstrated their miracle to the protagonist I don't buy them because the message is too weak. Every [i]""Side character""[/i] is just a plot device, They exists just for that specific situation not to mention that the ""Creeper"" trope that were used for 3 of them. Just please make the event and narrative more impactful and meaningful[/spoiler] 

also about the protagonist, He is not very likable. The very instant we are given the option to name our character communicates to us that we are suppose to ""Project"" ourselves into the protagonist but the dialog option is too little and the ""bad"" one is pointless unless you want a bad ending otherwise the story will progress on the same path as the good one. 

Overall 5/10 for someone who is not really into VN genre, I assume that those who like it will find this game pretty average but consumable.

[u][h1]Regarding the Censorship[/h1][/u]
I senses that the developer has to T-Spin the ""18+ character"" in there to get around the lion lair of rogue valve employee. But fear not, Unlike console peasant who have to deal with SJW hive minded Sony, We PC master race can install  [url=https://qureate.net/nekomiko/en/patch/]Offical Patch[/url] or mod(for some game) that released on the wide free land know as [b]The Internet[/b].

"Laziest port I've ever played.

Like many Japanese ports of console games to PC, it's basically just the console game with a menu tacked onto the beginning (this menu is actually a separate exe as far as I can tell). There's no way to access this menu from in-game. This means if you want to change any of the controls (including sensitivity), graphics options, etc, you need to restart the game. To add insult to injury...

[list]
    [*] Only some of the game text/prompts are changed. ""Press START button"" right on the main menu.
    [*] No mouse navigation anywhere in the game menus (except for the PC options menu that appears before the game)
    [*] The mouse is just used as the analog stick. This is a STRATEGY GAME where instead of clicking on the units you have to use the keyboard to control menus. You can sort of awkwardly move the pointer around using the mouse, but there's a lot of weird acceleration, so it doesn't work anything like an actual mouse. Also it seems to use the same acceleration as the aiming does. Your arm will get tired trying to change targets.
    [*] There's an ""options"" choice on the main menu that takes you to the console options menu where you can change subtitles/etc. So there's actually 2 options menus... one you need to restart the app for, and another one in-game
    [*] Mouse sensitivity is on the PC options menu. And it's not a slider -- it's a single button that increments the value (5-100) by 5, then resets. So if you want to change the sensitivity from 35 to 30, you have to click the button 19 times.
    [*] The whole PC options menu is very slipshod; probably done in 3 hours by some overworked, hung-over salary man. Either that or SEGA doesn't believe in any UI elements other than buttons.
    [*] HD textures? Antialiasing? Haha yeah right.
    [*] Honestly it looks like the game is rendering in 720p and upscaling, considering the weird jaggies along edges.

You'd think for $17.99 they could spend at least a month trying to just barely integrate it into the platform. You'd be wrong. I've seen some lackadaisical ports before, but this even beats out the Grandia 2 PC port.

Is this a good game? Aside from the controls, it seems like it. The setting is cool and I like the idea behind the hybrid strategy combat. But it's hard to get past how this game completely misunderstands te platform that it's on. It feels like a cash grab by SEGA rather than something they spent any time on. They do not deserve $17.99 for this piece of 💩.

Yes, I know I've only spent under an hour with it, and that's all the time I needed to realize how awful this game's PC rendition is.",False
"I've heavily enjoyed this game for a multitude of reasons. However as every game out in the market there are some flaws (Only one major one as of right now that I hope gets fixed soon.)

Pros:
1: There are a large selection of character, each with their own playstyle and abilities. You are sure to find your favorite here as there are melee, short range, and long range characters.

2: The soundtrack is amazing. It fits so well with the game because at its core, you are trying to survive in a harsh world.

3: The levels are diverse and have secrets in them that you will need certain items to get to.

4: The enemies are varied and have their own attack patterns. The wisps for example try to attack you at range while the Golem will try to smash you.

5: Co Op is really fun to play, you have to coordinate with your friends to survive as you do NOT share item buffs. Everyone gets their own items so best to play wisely.

6: The majority of times that you die will because YOU fucked up. Either you decided to stay in a fight that you're not prepared for, you spent too long in a level and now the Difficulty Meter is at Hard, or you decided to fight Providence with only 4 items under your belt.

7: The Difficulty Meter is a pretty neat addition to this already great game. The longer you spend in your current run, the harder the game gets. You first have your three base difficulty levels all based on the types of rain, then you have this meter. The difficulty carries through the levels so you have to decide if it's worth spending the extra time in one level to find the rest of the loot or to skip out on it to make the game easier on yourself.

Now for the cons:

1: Co Op connectivity is pretty bad at times. You will sometimes see your friends sliding across the map with their hands in the air.

2: Sometimes a bunch of enemies will just spawn on top of you without warning. That's really aggravating as it feels like that kind of death was just cheap instead of your own fuck up.

3: Now this is a bug I've experienced as have all my friends but sometimes the map doesn't fully load, as in the art assets will, but the boundaries won't so we've fallen through the floor and into the void plenty of times. This bug is usually at the first level so you won't have a major build most of the time.

So with all that in mind I honestly recommend this game heavily as it's now one of my favorites.

"I heard that the game crashes a lot and stuff but nothing happened to me but since i just played 46 min just to get the permission to review dont take my word for it. The game only saves around 7 times the whole game (i counted it because i  saw how bad it is so i wanted to put it in the review).  The story is really good and the gameplay is superb, It takes the gameplay from the first game and makes it even better by allowing you to dual wield a weapon and plasmid. It also gives you the iconic drill and makes you play as a big dady. Its one of my best games of all time.
So overall this game is great but from what i heard its unplayable from the many bugs. Hope they fix it so people can enjoy this game.
10/10 (withought bugs)

"One of *THE* best puzzle games in gaming history. The effort the developer put into this completely shows, and I can only pray to whatever God that allowed a game like this to exist for an Antichamber 2 to come out. It seems upon research that this is unlikely, which truly makes this game one-of-a-kind. This game completely outshines Portal 1 & 2.

Do not look up the answers to the puzzles in this game. You WILL get stuck. Drop it and come back to it later. If you beat it, try to replay it in a year. This game presents a true puzzle, and a very rewarding sense of achievement once you actually progress to uncharted areas. I congratulate anybody who gets through this game, or even a 100% completion without a guide or research of any sort.

TL;DR: This game is a work of art. Buy it. It's even worth it if it's not on-sale. It's fucking beautiful in every way, shape, and form, and the miniature stories related to the puzzles are the icing on the cake. I'm being 100% serious when I say this: 11/10. It's a MUST-BUY.",True

If you're not using every possible advantage, or if you try to fight every battle the same way, people are going to die. A lot. 

Actually, that's going to happen anyway. Be ready for it. The trick is to recruit at about the same rate you lose them.

"[h1]Pointless nostalgic intro[/h1]

Back in 2005, when AoE III was released, I'd already been playing the 2nd for several years. Being an amateur and enthusiast of medieval warfare, the period of time didn't seem too appealing to me. Moreover, I was so used to the iconic 2D graphics of the first 2 AoE titles, that I couldn't join yet the revolution Age of Mythology had started some time earlier.

Then, I found a torrent for the vanilla plus TWC somewhere in 2009 or '10 and it didn't took a while before I developed a passion for the game. But enough of my personal history and feelings with the game's series.

[h1]Actual review and rating[/h1]

I rate the whole expanded game [b]8/10[/b]*. If I were you I would wonder [i]what's wrong with the game so that you didn't rate it 10/10?[/i] The main reason I didn't entirely like AoE III was:

-Lack of deep european theatre
Which subsequently implies the game lacks the following content (more or less):

-European maps and respective natives [i](local inhabitants that commonly formed regional cultures)[/i]
-European conflicts within Europe [i](like the Napoleonic Wars)[/i]
-European major factions/civilisations like the Austrians, the Swede, the Poles, the HRE, and so on
-European ""minor"" factions between which most of the mentioned-above conflicts occured [i](e.g. the thirty years' war?)[/i]
-I could go on for ages

*I rate the vanilla [b]7/10[/b], and Asian Dynasties [b]9/10[/b]. I liked the accuracy and dedication towards the Asian cultures and peoples, perhaps the crappiest part was that they didn't bother changing the town noise and sounds at all. I cannot say anything about the Warchiefs because I played the native factions very little and am myself not-so experienced with [i](post-colonisation)[/i] north and mesoamerican civilisations.

Many by now are probably already thinking that the review is pointless because ""muh europe"", but hey, we successfully founded the first advanced civilisations, kingdoms and later empires - ultimately colonising the world. So, whether you like that or not it's history, and we're a large part of it.

Anyway, if you want to know how good the game is, just read older and more rated reviews. I can simply tell you that if you're looking after a traditional RTS set right after the middle ages until the beginning of the 19th century, you won't be disappointed at all. 

In case you agree with me on the lack of the European content, I highly recommend you install the [b][url=www.ne.elpea.net/forum/portal.php]Napoleonic Era mod[/url][/b]. It adds some 5/6 factions and a bunch of units, maps, etc. It also has a small online community.",True

"**Preface**

I played a majority of the game in offline mode, hence the 7ish hours of playtime on record


The Good:

+ Fantastic atmosphere and visual style (even though 99% of the game takes place at night)
+ Characters, even ancillary citizens, are well voiced and feel three dimensional
+ Story nicely meshes together vampire fiction and the historic setting
+ The citizen system is an interesting mechanic
+ Ideal RPG length (30 - 40 hours)


The Bad:

- Animations during conversations are repetitive and eyes don't move which creates a kind of uncanny valley feeling
- Difficulty can fluctuate, some places it's too hard, others too easy (and it happens at random)
- Combat quickly becomes repetitive
- No real meaningful rewards for NOT killing off citizens
- Various smaller issues with the citizen system
- No fast travel system makes travel tedious sometimes


The Bottom Line:

I was hyped when I heard that Dontnod was making a vampire themed RPG, coming off of Life is Strange I was eager to see what this same developer could do with a full fledged title whose genre seemed incredibly appropriate for the kind of characterization, story, and emotional depth they had already shown in that aforementioned game. However, I was wary too...could they pull off something like this? Something much more demanding and robust - gameplay wise - than Life is Strange?

Thankfully, Vampyr ended up being a solid game and a great first attempt for a developer who has had no experience in the RPG genre before. 

As expected, the voice-acting and characterization is spot on and the story does well in mixing 1918 Spanish Flu-plagued London with a fictional tale of a doctor turned vampire seeking out a cure to this new apocalyptic disease, all the while trying to maintain his own humanity. Taking place on the streets of a beautifully realized London by night, the game does great at establishing an atmosphere and creating an interesting world filled with characters who all have their own personalities, hopes, dreams, and conflicts. 

But as could be expected of their debut into the genre, some aspects of the gameplay could've been better. The combat for example takes cues from other RPGs like The Witcher 3 - combining melee weapons and powers - but something just didn't work as well and fighting quickly devolves into repetitive button mashing. Managing difficulty also seemed to be a challenge as the developer chose not to use a level scaling system - locking the player out of certain areas/confrontations, making world navigation and objective completing sometimes tedious but the biggest issue I had was encountering areas and enemies that were sometimes too easy and sometimes too hard. For example, fighting a certain boss towards the second half of the game took me 25 attempts to finally beat, yet facing down the final boss was a cake walk...with me only gaining 2 levels in between those fights. That shouldn't happen.

Far and away the most interesting mechanic of the entire game though that brought both positives and negatives to the table was the citizen system. It provided a fantastic way in which the player could interact with the world and gain a better understanding of Vampyr's story and setting and - of course - gain access to side missions. However, the most interesting aspect about it was whether or not the player chose to feed off of these citizens - giving them a large experience boost but removing that citizen (and all associated benefits, side missions, etc) from the game and driving the district towards chaos-status.

Having played the game without killing citizens though I came away a little underwhelmed. There's no real reward for keeping everyone alive and healthy (and doing that is incredibly tedious over those 30 - 40 hours) other than snippets of dialogue here and there. Doing so also made the clue system pointless as those are only geared towards increasing the XP gained from killing citizens...so, in effect, the only practical reason to get to know the citizens better is in order to kill them? That doesn't seem right.

These small issues aside the citizen system was an interesting implementation and it'd be neat to see future RPGs incorporate something similar if only better refined and expanded upon.

All-in-all, Vampyr is a good game. It wasn't the ""knock my socks off"" experience I was hoping it would be but its a solid vampire themed role-playing game and is certainly worth a run through for anyone interested in the setting or genre.

It's lighthearted, mechanically sound (if not terribly innovative really), artistically magnificent, and just altogether charming. As is the case with many indie games, it has a healthy dose of humour and 4th-wall-breaking, and more gaming references than you can shake a deku stick at. (I'm incredibly sorry for that one, that's my bad.)

"The Isle, as of the time this review has been put out, I think this game is a good one. This game is slow paced though, so you should think over if you are into slow paced games. If you want a dinosaur simulation game, this is the one for you. You can play a variety of several different herbivores and carnivores as Humans and Tribals are yet to come. There are two game-modes out right now, maybe some more may be added or removed, so keep that in mind. We have survival mode and sandbox, survival mode is where you start of as a smaller dinosaur and grow into an adult. Sandbox, you can spawn in as any sized dinosaur on The Island. 

First of all, the community is a nice community where it consists of many nice people and not too many toxic ones. Some people do not like the game creator Dondi because sometimes he doesn't treat people all too nicely. Personally, he is a good developer although sometimes I disagree with him sometimes. The development team altogether is a good development team that listens to the community and you won't find any problems within the development team.

Game-play is really nice too, sometimes you may experience that the game isn't too optimized on some maps which is why the game is in early access but it will be fixed in the future, but the graphics and the shadows are really nice as it runs on unreal engine. Playing as the dinosaur is quite fun, recent updates are cool as you can change the way your dinosaur looks, making it unique. Combat in this game is quite average, where you run through dinosaurs and isn't too satisfying when you fight another dinosaur, although I know there is going to be a big update on the combat, so look forward to that. The developers do well to balance out all of the Dinosaurs among the game, not making one or another 'overpowered'.

The sounds too are quite realistic and amazing, the sounds of the dinosaurs roars don't sound cheap, also noticing the footsteps for the bigger dinosaurs is a realistic addition when they make a loud boom every time they step, sometimes you can even hear the dinosaur walking before you see it. The environment too sounds great and the sounds change depending on where you are and what time it is. Music in the game sounds excellent, there are tracks for the time of the day and it fits the theme of The Isle, maybe some additions to that may come. 

Bottom line, the game is well made and you will be impressed by the quality of the game-play, community is overall nice. You still need to know that this game is slow paced, just remember that because some people have mixed reviews about it, but personally I think it's fine. This is the game for you if you want a survival simulation dinosaur game.",True

"Cons:

-1 Launch has more bugs/issues/server problems than beta did.

-1000 Loot system is insanely frustrating, for better gear to drop it's based off your ilvl(which isn't shown), but in chaos 1 for example you can get a chaos 1 green that ranges in ilvl which you cannot see, You could get a max ilvl for chaos 1 that ends up being a green instead of a legendary.  Meaning if you want better gear to drop for you, you need to have that high ilvl chaos green equipped on one of your characters in your deck.  Long story short, to farm loot effectively you need a calculator and a spreadsheet open for every item that drops regardless of quality/color.

-1 Basically it's DD1 trying so desperately to be different that it's simply making a good thing bad, they really just needed to keep what was good and imrpove on it instead of trying to make it unique (which they failed to do anyways)

Pros:

+1 Character Deck allows you to level up each of your heros at the same time, so you don't need to level 4 characters through the story mode.
+1: Some improvements with character swapping over the first one, with their quick swap hotkeys and you not having to drop mana when you swap.
+1 You don't have to choose between Hero gear and Defense turret gear, relics are for turrets, armors/weapons for hero

tldr: If you can survive this loot system then surviving cancer wont be a problem.. They are basically the same thing",False

"Farming Simulator 19 is hands down the best farming game on Steam!

"I've only played until chapter 3 but here's what I think about the game:
I recommend playing the game with a gamepad as opposed to your usual keyboard since the controls would be sooo much easier with it. I met a few minor bugs at the beginning of the game but they're not really affecting the game's quality. So far, I find the battle mechanics enjoyable and quite immersive (because it's interactive and we actually have to ""act"" instead of just hitting ""Attack"" and letting the character play out itself). UI is neat and easily understandable. I like how we can see the monsters instead of just suddenly randomly bumping into one. Story and dialogue is well written and so far, it hasn't bored me. There are some cute Indonesian references here and there (like Cho Pet, suwun, etc.).  Character design is nice and I absolutely enjoy looking at the live 2D sprites. As for the 3D graphics, it's okay but not the best for a game in it's era... Somewhat reminds me of FF8, but better. Sometimes the z distance (front/back) throws me off, but I haven't gotten too annoyed with it.

TL;DR: Good game, 100% recommended for JRPG and RPG fans all around!",True
"Glad I bought it! The game is fun, the developers are active and seem to communicate to their community. 

The game is definitely not for everyone. Do you like building machines? Sometimes to fail spectacularly in the process...lol
I haven't even touched the multiplayer or workshop yet and I have already racked up 40 hrs just goofing around while watching youtube and just relaxing. I hope that the developers add more textures to the game, and more materials then what is currently in game. There is a lot of cool stuff in the community workshop... but the game should come with more materials to work with.

I give this game a 9/10! Pick it up even at full price. Thanks for reading.",True

"""Why contain it?
's cool.""
-- Voltaire

One might argue what really makes a great game. Game mechanics, plot, characters, visuals, level designs, good marketing move to release at certain time or other nerd stuff. 
So why's everyone keep telling that a game with broken mechanics, outdated graphics, nonexistent ai and muhconspiracyfoilhats plot is one the best games ever made?


It's always delivery. Deus Ex setups setting and drag you in from the first minutes, every time you play you will find something new: new newspaper article you didn't read, new way into some important building,  another chat from hobos about area 51 and stuff like this. Every level in this game is made for exploring. First time i played (2012, so no nostalgia tripping here) i didn't even know there's sidequests in this game. 


""Kill a prisoner against my orders!""
-- Joseph Stalin


Wide variety of weapons with most of them being useless until you max out weapon mastery like it's goddamn Morrowind, one-shotting soldiers and randomly running enemies probably make it a bad FPS. But every time you find new weapon mod in some dumpster you're overjoyed like a boy who sees tits for the first time. Halfway in the game you're just noscoping with sniper rifle and stabbing people with jedi nano-sword and you're unable to notice any flaw, since plot has no brakes whatsoever and you jump around the globe engaging in terrorism and other pleasant activities.


""I am the bartender... I am your man.""
--Bartender


Bunch of ABSOLUTELY useless skills and augs that are in no circumstances would help you WHATSOEVER, non-existent economy and dialogue decisions once in forever would probably make it a bad RPG. However, with a way that characters react to your decisions and even playstyle,JC's killer quotes and a lot of really interesting stuff you will argue with absolutely random people (this barmen in triad club talking about how chinese dictatorship is far superior to corrupted Burgerland capitalism. I don't even want to mention this cool AI dude in some room in Illuminati hideout) along with sometimes pretty non-linear ways to handle stuff (Only time when game-designers will not let you do whatever you want and force you to bend to the plot by throwing at you invincible enemy and a bunch of invisible walls can be noticed only by true MLG autists like me) will make you forget this too. Not to mention that main character is collest and dangerousestest nigga in da hood (major fault of deus ex 2 was a bunch of tumblr-like characters, even JC will talk some boring quotes of old farts like nobody's business).


""I think the black people didn't show up for work at all...suspicous...""
-- George Washington


And atmosphere! It really feels like you're secret agent on the run in decaying near future society: uncovering conspiracies, killing corrupt officials, engaging in corporate espionage, lethally throwing soy food at soldiers, blocking enemies with cardboard boxes, using explosives to climb walls and healing yourself by jerking off a water cooler for a goddamn minute. While majority of good old games is rendered barely playable by time because of retarded interface, already fixed in remakes/sequels retarded mechanics, applied wizard science to launch them or what not, deus ex instead of being a barely moving old fart is a motherflipping [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gshEhgKZhoc]MC Vspyshkin[/url]: game is unarguably pretty old, but is still fun and kicking butt. Once you played it one time you will reinstall every time you hear The Synapse on the internet.

And with all this replay value, there's also mods and multiplayer.

Considering all that, i can only give this game 100 rusty skull-guns out of 100 and encourage you to play it as fast as possible in case you haven't.

If there was anything that I would improve or add to this game, it would be the research tree.  It seemed really short to me and while presented in different ways, the main research tree seemed to be accomplished very quickly during the game.  I played thru the game expecting to be able to create the similar types of robotic henchmen and augmentations, but was sadly disappointed as I was left w/ regular unenhanced human troops.

I vastly prefer the original DoW, WA or even DC to this installment. The two new races both feature magic, and it just doesn't fit well with the other races. It's unbalanced somehow.

The AI is atrocious. Units getting stuck in terrain, units not engaging in melee even when told to, units disobeying orders, units doing nothing.

The campaign has some of the worst grind I have ever seen. Each stronghold map is a gruelling, minimum 2-hour snoozefest with waves upon waves upon waves of enemies hurled at your forces. These missions are heavily scripted and are really terribly boring.

The flyer units fit neither the engine nor the theme of this game, they were a complete waste of time and developer resources.

I'm starting to think that there is an upper limit to the usefulness of various races. Sometimes, more really is less.

"Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a game in which i have alot of divided thoughts, i am a huge metal gear solid fan and was super excited for this game to come out and on many points it delivered on my expectations. The gameplay is super smooth and very fun, now you are not fighting the controls anymore to pull off cool looking cqc combos and it is really easy to do creative moves with all of the gadgets that you unlock as you play through the game.

Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain picks up 9 years after Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes and i recommend that you play that one first to fully grasp why the game starts as it does.(i would recommend that you play through every game in the series as they are really good) You control Venom Snake as he seeks revenge on Cipher for what happened to MSF at the end of MGSV:GZ and the game starts off really strong because of this, the first level is really slow and restricted but is also a super good cinematic mission that shows how brutal this game is compared to the previous ones. After that you start re-building your army by fulton-extracting soldiers you find in the world.

This game has an ""open world structure"" you basically have two huge sandboxes(Afghanistan and central Africa) but don't mistake this game for a ""GTA like"" game, there are no strip-clubs or bowling or anything like that. The world is by design pretty barren, but this is not a negative thing, you are in war zones after all. You only encounter soldiers and wild animals out in the world and i think that was a pretty good choice.

The earlier metal gear games are known for having super long cutscenes and playing out in a 60% cutscene and 40% gameplay, that is not the case here, the story is mainly told by cassette tapes that you aquire after main missions and i thought this was a missed opportunity. The story overall is really bare in this game and alot of the time nothing plot heavy is happening. What we do get in terms of story is really good and the cutscenes look amazing with great graphics and really good voice acting, the music is also great but i would have loved to see alot more of it instead of listening to cassettes to get the story.

The later parts of the game really suck, where you have to replay previous missions with higher dificulity/not getting spotted to unlock the ending, as good as some of the moments are in this game, this was a stupid choice by Kojima Productions. With everything that happened between Hideo Kojima and Konami the game clearly suffered and did not get completed as data miners have found files that show that they were going to have three instead of two chapters in the game, and it really could have needed another chapter to tie off the story since alot of the plot is never resolved.


Story: 7.5/10
Gameplay: 9.5/10
Graphics: 9,5/10
Total experience: 7/10

Kojima productions clearly did not finish this game as the later parts of it show, The game is good and i recommend it, but it could have been a masterpiece if it had been finished properly and all of the story threads were finished.

Combat is the biggest draw as you can play like any kind of character on any class and completely customize your experience. There is such a strong and rich story you can play it like a RPG or get involved in the vast array of group content! If you are a MMO fan or an Elderscrolls fan this is a must!,True
"Love this game, a bit of a grind for money at the end. 

* I would love some more visual upgrades to your home and surroundings. 
* Walking in the cellar should be improved i keep walking against objects and walls.
* So much research points nothing to do with.
* Putting up all the candles etc. Feels like a chore.
* Some endgame food not sellable.
* Alchemy could be better explained used a wiki for loads of things.
* Need improved storage options.
* Some NPC's do need more interactions.
* Need to build more farms like a chicken coop.

[Spoiler] Story/NPC interactions came in the form of a DLC,,,,,[/Spoiler]",True
"A classic within the open world rpg genre. I understand a lot of people may think it is a dated game nowadays, but I played it first in 2017 and enjoyed it. Oh, and music is top notch to explore to.",True

"Do you like to get [b]Frustrated!? [/b]  
Nostalgic for the days of Battletoads & Double Dragon on the SNES!? 
You know, riding jet skis at a dangerously fast pace jumping off ramps only to die/land into bunch of colorful balls from a reject 90s Chuck E Cheese forcing you to throw your controller against the nearest wall with all of your concentrated rage…only to pick it up and try it again and again. Well, none of that beautiful 90s wacky-ness shows up in this game. 

	This game brings the frustration but in a new Spooky-Eerie-Is that a [b]Giant Ass Spider[/b]-atmospheric nature. Almost a throwback to Pitfall with puzzles/obstacles except you will [b]die[/b]. You will die [u]a lot.[/u] And the deaths are dope!

"Good fps, easy to play, relatively easy to find all diamond locations, clear objectives. 

I like how they expanded the map compared to the first far cry game: In far cry 2, you can drive a car, boat, etc. to travel between zones, and when a mission ends, you can return to a safehouse, which is nice. It's true, sometimes when you are returning to a safehouse sometimes there are some partols attacking you in different positions of the map, but unless you are playing in the realistic difficulty, you should be fine.

Just one negative comment that sometimes when you talk to your buddies, they sometimes have a bug, repeating over and over again a conversation. For me, this seems to resolve if you look at them directly from the right angle. A bit annoying, but a very small glitch. Overall, I recommend this game.",True

"Very good game! 
(+)
-Good storyline
-Decent graphics
-Weapons are badass!
-Gameplay is fun

(-)
-Running is blurred


This game is pretty good in it's globality. The game managed to structure a world built and ruled by the Nazi's and that was quite a challenge to achieve. If you select the hardest mode you will also discover a complete different gameplay perspective as you will have to aim for a more stealth mode to get rid of some oponents!

"If you knew what myself and two compadres (Jason and Callum)  went through to get our chicken dinner, I'd win the internet:

-Start match and enter a small cluster of homes
-Friend 'experiments' with a grenade through a window
-I'm on the other side. I survive (barely). Find a sniper rifle just after.
-Take a UAZ vehicle and search for decent gear.
-Storm towards a supply crate drop. Crash into a buggy who had same idea. We all bail out and start shooting at eachother. Everyone shoots at me first. I go down. Calum accidentally shoots Jason in the head in the confusion. He also goes down. Motorcycle then joins the fray crashes into the buggy. One occupant dies. I crawl into a bush to try wait out the gunfight for a revive. I get popped in the head by our surviving motorcyclist who saw me. I die. My lone buddy then kills everyone else, and revives Jason.
-Two surviving buddies proceed to loot everyone's corpses and the supply crate. They don't notice the blue circle bearing down on them. Suddenly they see the circle on their mini-map. Callum just screams ""JASON!"". Jason knows what's up and drops what he's doing and jumps into the UAZ that is about to leave without him. They race the blue circle to safety on a hill overlooking a large field. They see between 10-15 people having a firefight. Callum has a turkey shoot with his bolt action rifle looted from the crate. Jason pulls out the sniper looted from my body and realises in the hurry to escape the blue circle, he forgot to grab ammo for it. Turkey shoot ensues, then the surviving 2 people jump into a car and flee.
-Again the blue circle is noticed last second. Panic ensues because the UAZ is deep outside the blue circle, so my friends start running for their lives and get overtaken by the circle, but manage to jack a UAZ in the field left by the now murdered owners, and race into the white circle. Jason is driving and drashes into a canal. Callum politely (condensending swearing) informs Jason how useless their position is.
-Exit canal and get into a firefight with last three players while prone in the smallest circle possible in a wheat field. Jason tries to frag grenade. Throws smoke instead. Then throws a stun grenade. It misses by 10 metres.
-After all this they somehow win and kill the other three, and we all get a chicken dinner.

10/10 will play with these misfits again.",True

"Its really not that bad, the game is fun if you like this type of game and they are still updating and sticking with it.",True
Wish I could give the game a good review but the RTS is not balanced.  You have to rush or you lose.  The enemy AI will just pump out troops over and over until you are overwhemled without a rush.,False
"Before you comment, ask yourself these questions. . .

1 - How many innocent civilians did you massacre by running them over with an SUV in GTA?

2 - How many Russian, Serbian, Afghani, Korean, Chinese, and many more ethnic soldiers have you literally committed genocide against in the likes of Call of Duty, Battlefield, Medal of Honor, ect?

3 - How many people have you curb stomped and cut in half with a chainsaw in Gears of War?

The only difference between any of those and this game is that those games gave you in your face context.

They are evil = Kill them!
They are the enemy = Kill them!
They disagree with us = Kill them!
We have a different ideology = Kill them!
You government said so = Kill them!
We have ""evidence"" to believe they may or may not do something bad in the unforeseen future = Kill them!

In games we kill because we can, many times ignoring the context altogether. Killing has become the primary objective in games. With or without context, it makes no difference. You Can! = Kill Them!

This game represents the complete inappropriate and overreative nature of politicians in the United States when it comes to guns. The game is designed from the ground up to demonstrate just how irrational a lot of gun law talk is. 

This is obviously not a game for everyone, and is rated such. (there are only 26 games ever to exist rated AO, and this is only one of 3 games given the rating purely because of violence). But before you go hating on this game, just think about the first few questions I asked, and then if this really is that bad in comparison. I give this game a thumbs up, purely because it filters nothing.

Few things that need fixing (which the devs most likely are looking into already):
- Animations for characters are janky
- Menus need mouse support
          - On Win10, the mouse cursor is constantly loading/spinning in menus
- Camera spazzing out occasionally
- Prerendered cutscenes don't align with audio
          - Cutscenes may need to be rendered entirely again (or possibly recreated in-engine)

This was the first video game I was ever exposed to. My dad used to let me watch him play it. It is the best game ever. Sure I can count the pixels on the screen but its just such a nicely done game. It's unfortunate that the multiplayer was never given the attention it deserved. This game would be great fun to play with friends. Still an amazing experience in single player.

"I wanted to like this game, I really did.  In my opinion, it suffers from some serious issues that may not be a deal breaker for everyone, but it was for me.  

1.  Every playthrough takes exactly one hour, from birth to death of old age.  That being the case, I find it impossible to remember all of even the most basic crafting recipes, AND in what biomes certain things are located, AND remember where you have been and how to get back there, AND learn how the community you have been born in runs things and what they want you to do, AND keep yourself fed, in only 1 hour.  

2.  On several occasions I have been born into an endless sea of objects carefully arranged along the ground as far as the eye can see, because there seems to be no mass storage mechanic (if there is, who has the time to figure it out?).  As a result, a communities entire resource cache gets distributed all over every square of its territory, leaving a noob to wander endlessly trying to learn where everything is.  

3.  With only an hour to live, trying to properly communicate with anyone is nearly impossible.  What should I be doing?  Where is X found?  I played 4 playthroughs, and spent all of them feeling lost and like a burden on society.  

4.  The crafting UI is anemic at best.  Either remember everything yourself, or spend your entire life cycling through everything that could be crafted with what you are holding with the Tab button.  

They say this game is not for everyone, and it certainly wasn't for me.  I do like the art, and the sound effects are adorable.  A lot of love clearly went into this game, and for that I give mad props to the devs, but the learning curve is rather steep, and there is an awful lot of pressure to ""git gud"" in order to not be the cause of annihilation for an entire tribe.  So I can't really recommend this game at it's current price or configuration, but there is room for improvement.",False

Very Nice game and is really scary at first. The first time I played this game I couldn't play it for more than one night at a time because of how nervous and frightened I was.  Nicely made and executed very well. However the jumpscares will get very old after a few nights and just an annoying scream that says you lost. But if you are up for a challenge like I was then you can try to beat this game on the highest difficulty and spend hours trying to beat 20/20/20/20 mode.  I have yet to beat it after all of these hours poured into it. The closest I have gottten is just a few seconds (5-10 seconds) left in the night  and plan to beat it very soon.

This simple but sentimental story takes place in the far future where ""Earth"" is but a mythology and is apparantly uninhabited by our species. I kind of like that super-far-away-while-still-relatable setting. The soundtrack is pretty immersive and is also recommended. The price point is a bit high for its content, but I think I grabbed it during a sale?

The downside is basically the gameplay itself and the related achievements. It's way too repetitive. The positive review is for its outstandingly spiritual story...",True

A lot of people compare the combat to Dark Souls and Soul Calibur but I really don't see the resemblance. It also sounds like it's inspired a fair bit by the Jedi Knight games, but i've never played those. You can live all your dreams of pointed and sharp weapons, from poking someone in the eye to cutting their shin. One of the best parts is that not all weapons are pointed and sharp, thanks to Steam Workshop integration. Overall great game, would recommended to anyone who's a fan of sword fights. i give it a good/10 much sword so indie (im sorry). also all the unlocks are cosmetic ok",True

Personally i was looking for a cool fps/rts game and it looked promising but tbh its not. 
This said, If you are looking for a Planetside 2 type multiplayer game, this is for you

"[Positive:]  Awesome game! The horror aspects actually work pretty well with the Disney-like style. The story is great, and even though a little bit confusing, is like 2+2 compared to FNaF's.The puzzles are very confusing at first, I spent three hours on the first half of Act 1! Having everything in the game misspelled and scrambled up makes it even more mysterious. I will never call a lovesh by its actual name again. And the neighbor. With his crafty AI so creepy and watchful, it's no wonder I could only beat the game by putting him on friendly mode. He puts beartraps and cameras in every nook and cranny you can slip through. Expect to ascend a flight of stairs thinking you slipped past his grasp, only to find yourself staring him in the face!

[Negative:] There are bugs. The Items love to glitch out on you, and losing one small key means restarting the game from scratch. Also, some of the game was made like it was slapped together and published without a second thought. (i.e. the act finale, and literally anywhere outside the game borders.)  What I think is kinda dumb is the stuff that is meant to look broken. It just makes the game look trashy. 

[Conclusion:] This game is always a must have, but wait until it's on sale. I wouldn't recommend it at full price until my list of negatives is 0.",True
"All the bad reviews are probably right.

The game is clunky, Voice acting is bad-to-okay at best, story seems alright to me tbh. 

Game starts a bit slow and can be hard to get into but so far I'm really enjoying it.

I'd recommend on sale.

In some small way it reminds me a lot of the first Witcher game.

If you can commit to knocking down the game to 30fps its a very enjoyable and unique experience. I tweaked the settings out the roof using every guide I could get my hands on but in the end the game is VERY cpu demanding! Bumped it down to 30fps and was able to crank most of the settings to high/highest including Nvidia effects with about 45-50% cpu load. Looks amazing and plays just fine with that being said. Highly recommend for a different take on the FF universe thats both quirky and entertaining.,True

"I was a TD player as early as when Warcraft 3 was still online. I played it in Starcraft also and still have old maps on my computer that I play by myself on the rare occasion...
I was looking for a TD like those, perhaps because I loved them so much and so...I think I found something really good. Obviously, it's not completely the same but, for someone who is an old timer with TD, I'm very happy with this game and suggest it to any other old timer TD player.
Hours of fun!
For those who haven't done Tower Defence before, I suggest you give this a try. TD has an interesting concept of wanting to survive, then wanting to survive by not losing any lives in the process, then...Wanting to survive by not using this tower or just by using one type of tower...
Again, hours of fun by giving yourself restrictions, if not, there's quite a number of levels, so obviously it just gets harder and harder.

Of course not all of them enjoy it as CS in general reuires practice and presice aim, quick reaction time, and of course good hearing.
Everything about this game is solid and well made. Any and all mistakes are your fault, and nobody elses (Unless you have bad teammates, hackers or smurfs on the enemy team, etc.)

Along with the official gamemodes of Casual, Competitive, and Arms Race, there are also community gamemodes like Surf, Minigames, and Bunny Hopping. So this game is jam packed with replayablity on top of being a good game in general. All that it comes down to is if you have the patience to get better, admit that you make mistakes, practice practice practice, and most important, DO NOT GET INVOLVED IN SKINS!",True

"+ Excellent soundtrack and spectrum-sympathetic graphics style.

+ Enough bang for your buck. Certainly one of the best value for money games I've found on here. Under £2 and an hours entertainment.

"I know I ended up with Zenge because it came in the Relaxing Puzzle Box bundle.

I know I was specifically disinterested in it.

There is a point at which an activity is so dead simple that it transitions from recreational diversion into uninteresting busywork; ""approximately-10 piece jigsaw puzzles, but without even the jigsaw"" fit squarely into that category for me. But I wasn't repelled by the idea of having Zenge in my library—the art looked nice, in any case—and buying the bundle to get the games I did want was less expensive than buying them separately. So, whatever. Bought. I'll just blaze through it someday for the achievement, probably.

That day came, and I indeed began blazing through the game for its achievement. Barely even paying attention to the pieces I slid together. And then...

""...wait. [i]Is there a little [b]person[/b] in these drawings?[/i]""

Suddenly, I was entranced. This discovery [strike]that was written on the Steam store page, GG numbnuts[/strike] didn't make the puzzles any more interesting from a mechanical standpoint...but I was genuinely invested in following this unassuming little dude on his journey through Zenge's beautiful alien landscapes. And ultimately, I found doing so worthwhile. Meaningful, even.

Maybe this game can become a good one in the end. I think there's a long way there though...",True
"The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom -PC-

The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom is the “Dr. Seus” of 2D platform gaming. It plays well, it has a fun “indie” artistic style, and it narrative overlay is cleaver and witty. While it lasts, these misadventures are a great fun, unfortunately I plowed through this game is just a couple short hours. I would have liked to have seen a full scale adventure, but for what you pay for, it is well worth it.

In the game your objective is to try to get your character (who is a mix between Yogi Bear and Scrooge Mcduck) to collect all the pies on the screen.  The premise sounds simple, but it will soon become apparent that some of these pies are tricky sons of a gun to collect.

The levels are separated into sets of levels. At the beginning of a set, the game will introduce to you a new game mechanic, and for the rest of the levels collecting pies will be become increasingly more complex. Collecting pies has never been this hard before! The game mechanics are fresh and intuitive. I will not give any of the game mechanics away, for it would ruin the whole mystique. The new game  mechanics really set The Misadventures of Mr. Winterbottom apart from other generic puzzle side scrollers. I applaud the high standard of creativity.

Almost every puzzle is set in a static screen, there won’t actually be much side scrollin’ action in this game, only in the later levels you’ll be able to side scroll. I think this was because of the nature of these puzzles. They can get really tricky, and it is helpful to have the whole puzzle right in front of you at all times. I do prefer the classic side scroller, and many times the levels in this game felt like a puzzle level from “Tetris Attack” or “Yoshi’s Cooke”, I still enjoyed it.

As you run around as Mr Winterbottom, he controls reasonably well. He is not perfectly precise, but you rarely if ever will be punished for not being exact; your objective is to collect pies and as long as any part of you guy touches a pie, you’ll collect it.  The whole game is based on puzzles and not perfectly executed maneuvering (even though some levels trick you into thinking so)

The story and narrative are reminiscent of popular children books. The phrasing rhymes, and come 2 lines at a time. There are still pictures that accompany every described location. I looked forward to the narrative as it came and I read and enjoyed every line.

The only real problem with The Misadventures of Mr. Winterbottom is that it is too short. I completed the game fully in less than 4 hours. Given, I am a wizard of sorts, but there just isn’t as much content as I would have liked. I can’t really complain cause I got the game for like $5 off of a Steam sale.

The Misadventures of Mr. Winterbottom is a great diversion with plenty of re play-ability: weather it be in attempts to get a better score / time or to watch someone else solve the puzzles for the first time, it is plenty of fun. I have suggested this game to a number of people, as I think it can be fun for a very broad # of people. Go and play you some Mr Winterbottom!

"Great game. Poor a drink, sit back and push 'dem buttons to power your steam ship!

Truely a lot of fun, much like Limbo, Firewatch or Dear Esther.

The fun is in the experience and art style.

However, just like the other games mentioned, it's far too short. (2.5 hours for me)

I would highly recommend this game. Fun while it lasts and worth the experience. For the price of a movie ticket it's better than any movie in theaters at the time of writing this review. Supporting artistic games that are fun, immersing, and beautiful is a win for all in my book.

I wish they had made an end game mode that was procedural so you could just push your ship on forever. I would have played another 5 hours before getting my fill.",True
"This game is the most fun I've had with a business/city sim. The aesthetic is so pleasant and easy on the eyes and the ability to adjust the game to be as easy or difficult as you want makes it very re-playable no matter what type of mood you're in or how much thinking you want to do. Also note that I played the game for 90+ hours before writing this review so that comment about re-playability is not just a prediction. If you enjoy sim games, I would buy this game even at full price. If it goes on sale, I suggest you try it even if you haven't tried sim games.",True

"This is more of a simulation racer than an Arcade racing game. It's very challenging, even on the lowest difficulty settings. Once you learn the calls and respect the track you race on it can become very satisfying to win races. My only issue with this game is- Snow maps. The maps with ice and snow are absolutely unforgiving. If you're driving a little too close to the edge the snow will take you out. They really need to let you choose which maps you want to race on. 8/10 worth buying on sale.",True
"I'm done with ""Dead Man's Switch"" and a few missions into ""Dragonfall.""

tl,dr: Don't buy the game unless you buy Dragonfall with it.

The combat is a bit simple, though turning up the difficulty helps immensely to provide a more engaging, complicated experience. It certainly doesn't feel like the fluidity one finds in a real tabletop game session, but then, to expect that from a computer game is usually folly.

The heart, and meat, of the game is, rather, in its dialogue and world. For clarity, don't expect voice acting and animated cutscenes. It's more in the mein of the aging RPGs like Baldur's Gate, but even less frilly. Characters are rendered convincingly, and with their own authorial voices. The writing never worse than ""pretty good.""

But where Dead Man's Switch (the base campaign) never gets far above pretty good, and maintains a dreary linearity at all times, Dragonfall excels. Dragonfall's characters and story are much more believably written, the world more flavorful, and the story less full of deus ex machina windfalls.

Where Dead Man's Switch feels like a saturday morning cartoon, Dragonfall is more like a well-written, high-budget film. I might watch both, but you can be sure I'd much rather watch the latter.",True

"This is a great idea for a game, but it is very flawed. I think that it is rediculous that there is some kind of animal every three feet in any direction you go (this is very unrealistic, if you have been in a actual forest you would know this). Also it is quite frustrating that every time you die you lose some of the stuff in your inventory. And the world could use more things in it, such as more caves and lakes and streams. Also maybe you could even add an abandoned hunters cabin or two. The food system also needs work, because food items such as berries and apples are pretty scarce. And also you should make carfting materials (especially fibers) more prevalent in the world. I think this game has potential, but obviously it needs ALOT of work. And also keep up the good work",False

This is the only game i've ever reviewed because of how strongly i feel about its worth. This game is amazing- -but not for everyone. Factorio features beautiful sprites and solid gameplay with amazing depth conjoined with high skill ceilings. I would say at its core Factorio is a puzzle game; However the caveat is that you yourself create your own puzzles that you yourself must solve in the form of resource delivery and management. This is only the tip of the iceberg. If you enjoy building towards a grand goal and unlimited freedom (sans flying) you will love this game in 5 hours.,True

The notes and documents taken/ collected will blow your mind away!  The storyline is so amazing that it will lure the player further into the game not wanting to leave out of his/her seat.  Graphics are very dark and little light is shown.  You have a flashlight, but it is not that illuminated, while running on batteries.  Make sure to play in a dark atmosphere to see better and volume turned up!  Anybody can enjoy and beat this game its too easy even if you make mistakes it respawns you at an autosave checkpoint.

"Prince of Persia: Warrior Within was a good experience? This game' story was great - it is conected to the first game Sands of Time but is not nessesary to play it first to have a gameplay experience - just story would make more sense? - I guess. 

Why I wrote ""a good experience"" with question mark was because many times I put this game on hold. Sometimes it was too confusing - got lost many times. The game is sort of open world which isn't really nessesary. Running backwards and not knowing where I had to go was a total waste of time (the map was just a picture where was a prince icon that changed location after moving a while and red cross as a mission  but which way I had to move - no idea). It wouldn't had changed a thing unless found a health upgrade secrets. Sometimes the game got too difficult. I was playing on the hardest difficutly - hoping for better game experience  - I love challenges.  After experiencing the difficulties I do not recommend it. It can ruin the game feel - too hard to kill the enemies. I am not sure how it is on easier difficulty but I assume it will be much more enjoyable experience. I still managed to finish the game on the hardest difficulty. But yeah - if you do play I strongly recommend to play it on easy or medium. 

Combat system in this game is great - lot of possibilities to attack. Main weapon kept changing to more powerful one throught out the game. There was a possibility to use dual weapons by grabbing dead enemy's sword, hammer, axe or whatever did they were using. The ways to perform attacks was incredibly high amount - use suroundings - jump off the wall - roll, spin, throw, combo slash etc. - very nice combat system.

Graphically speaking it was pretty decent - it is pretty old game (2004) - in old days it looked pretty awesome.

This game was much more violent in every way than the previous one - music - graphics - animations. I liked it.

I am strongly recommending this game if you did like Prince of Persia: Sands of Time.

"Like everyone else bought this game while the dev promised freatures he later decided would be too difficult to add.  Then instead of any possibly classy actions he decides to basically steal everyone's money and make a different game which is then ALSO charged for, even though we all paid him to develop this new game under the false pretense that he was developing this one.
Decent game, Dev is a terrible human being, lied and stole from his customers as far as I'm concerned.",False
"You know, I think that I have this in backlog due to some heavy Steam sale and curiosity that usually kills a cat. So I tried it, fully expected it to be either:
A) A complete shovelware.
B) Stupid very slow game for kids of fitting pegs into shapes.
C) Stupid game for kids of fitting pegs into shapes that does difficulty by GOTTA GO FAST.

I was pleasantly surprised. Turns out that it's actually a legit reaction puzzle game. It's actually a somewhat successful (with critics) game from 2008 that came out on Xbox 360 Live originally, being indie and all. Ported to PC, removing online multiplayer, so it has local one only. It has cute graphics and great music. At times.

And what makes it pretty good is that developers actually introduce new mechanics instead of just speeding action up. Each level may even drop elements differently. Sometimes you get stacks of four one by one. Sometimes you have to catch many elements at random spots at the same time. It's all a good fun.

Though what doesn't exactly work is camera. Or control. I sometimes miss the placement of pegs (elemental meteors, aha) due to camera beat placed to almost look from a side. Controls sometimes confuse me. You spin a circle of shapes either clockwise and counter-wise, and seeing how camera looks from a side, you may get confused whether to press left or right when element is in front of camera or in background.

But yeh, good fun for a bit. Also, having lava themed levels as final ones sucks.",True
"I've played this game a lot on PC, but many more hours on console.  I have gone through many cycles with this game.  With nearly 600 total hours I still can't fully tell you how I feel about Elite Dangerous.  I have loved it, it has tickled the inner space-nerd being able to fly in FTL speeds in a realist space sim seeing some amazing sites and there are times this game will make you stop what you're doing and just appreciate the universe we live in and its vast size.  

Space nerd rant asside, I have hated it at times because there can be a sense of going nowhere that it can give you in the grind or the missions that seemed to have no real impact. I'll go to thinking about all the things I wish the game WAS... I find myself quitting the game for a few months, but still checking the news about it, waiting for those awesome new updates. 

I always come back to the game, I eventually think about this game, it's a game I honestly think I'll continue to play for quite a while when it suites me.  I think the idea and scope of the game is amazing, and the idea of the ongoing simulation and the lore is another appeal to another very nerdy side of me.  

I would highly recommend this game, but just know that you're going to like it so much that it's going to hurt you that it can't do the things you know that it could.  Atmospheric planet gameplay, more engaging seasonal content, better discovery etc.  These are things I am confident that they will get right with time, and I am sure many would argue they are perfectly fine the way they are.  

Either way, you're either going to be the kind of person that's going to log in and have a difficult time docking the ship and be like ""awww helll nahhh"" and get a refund for the game, or you're going to be the guy who logs 800 hours in with an entire fleet.  There's a steep learning curve, but honestly, and if you hear anything else I say-- hear this, the learning curve is seriously the best part of the game.  Remember when I was saying I was still figuring the game out, at 600 estimated total hours in the game, I still haven't done a lot of the different types of things, I haven't figured out a lot of the mechanics, and I'm not that good overall... 

That's not to say I don't have millions of credits, can hold myself well in a dogfight and do all the normal day-to-day stuff alright, but stuff like exploring aliens and getting involved with community events, engineers, there's a host of things I really haven't gotten to involved in.

I'm glad I did buy it though.

The game is made in such a way that rushing and trolling isn't really viable because you will just die. There's no way for them to get satisfaction.

Two downsides. One big, one small.
The big one is the servers. Good god Ubisoft. it's like their servers are just a bunch of monkeys playing with abacusses.

"Not for nothing, and it is probably a nitpick most people will simply bash me for, but the reason I refunded this game was because of the model. Not that having a model is bad; but the fact is, I have long arms. 

I could not find a single option to increase arm length on the model, which led to me misjudging jumps, shots and slices for the swords. This caused me to end up looking more like the cyber ninja with poor depth perception than a badass warrior.

Also, due to the fact that VR is still in that stage of figuring out most of what it wants to do, the melee leaves much to be asked for. Not that its hard to figure out, the sharp end goes in the bad man, but its got that issue almost all melee VR titles have; which is basically that the most effective and destructive move you can do with your swords is to poke them with it and jiggle the handle really fast to kill them.

This, again, makes it hard to suspend your disbelief when you basically become the sonic tickle monster who slips into enemy compounds and makes the enemies giggle to death.

In all, I bet this game would be great some. Moving felt fluid and neat, which if you don't get motion sick easy is super satisfying to master. But for me, its a no; even if its for a fairly nitpicking reason. But unlike non VR games; I have to connect a bit with what I'm supposed to be. And if my arms stop almost a foot before my real arms do, it really messes with me.

Solid 7.5/10 for people without giant mungo arms.

Edit to positive: Sorry for the late edit here but even though I've not repurchased this game yet I'd like to thank the devs for adding a long arms mode to their game. Stuff like that is what makes good devs, great devs. Will certainly be repurchasing this in the future!",True

"This is a fun little game.  The graphics aren't much to look at but it draws from one of the greatest arcade games of all time: Asteroids.  So imagine you're playing asteroids, except that instead of giving you a weapon that goes ""pew pew pew"" you get a bunch of small projectiles on some kind of leash that you can whip around your ship as you fly.  That's basically the ""Particle Mace"" from the title.

So You're placed in a small area and these rather regularly sized asteroids come in around you.  They're not the main focus of the game though...they're more like extra obstacles.  The enemy ships ARE the main focus though.  They come in, darting at you, sweeping past you, flying all around.  You have to destroy these for big points, and for even bigger points you have to kill several in quick succession.   The way to a big score is not just killing enemies but combos.

You do get points for destroying the asteroids as well but it's a mere fraction of the points you get for destroying the ships.  However, there are some asteroid only rounds to clear so don't think you can ignore them totally.  Also, there's mission mode where each round has some objectives to complete The mission mode seems to be a collection of objectives you have to achieve before you can go to the next level. e.g. don't hit any asteroids for 20 seconds, don't hit any ships for 20 seconds, kill x number of ships in a certain time limit, destroy x number of asteroids completely (because hitting them only splits them in two and halves their size until they get really small). 

I had some trouble getting this game to work with the steam controller.  In fact I scrounged through the forums to see if there was a fix and found out the developer didn't really work to make it steam controller compatible because it came out just before the steam controller was available. :(  Most disappointing.  You'd think the developer would have worked on steam controller compatibility afterward but I guess he's no longer working on it.

So supposedly if you want to use the steam controller with this game, you have to totally clear all the Xbox controls out and make it work as a mouse and keyboard.  I don't know why it couldn't just work with a M&KB style config from the steam controller menu but that may be Valve's fault and not the developer.  I don't know.

Things I liked about this game:
[list]
 [*] It's fun
 [*] controls are pretty simple
 [*] The objectives are pretty simple
 [*] It's still challenging though
 [*] It's a new twist on an old formula
 [*] There's multiple ships to earn, and you earn those by doing certain things in game.
[/list]

Things I didn't like: 
[list]
 [*] It didn't want to work with the steam controller (I managed to get it working with an xbox controller)
 [*] Even with the xbox controller it didn't seem to respond to the menu very well.  In game it was fine though.
 [*] Some of the ships were less useful than others
 [*] Some of the ships are locked behind a ""mission mode"" game style.  
 [*] Some of the missions in mission mode were kinda lame
[/list]

Overall though, the game is fun and I enjoyed it enough to play it for nearly an hour my first time out on it (which I usually don't do unless I'm really having fun).",True

"Some of the reviews I read said it was even harder than the 3rd Wargame (Red Dragon) - which nearly put me off, I've found that so hard after repeated attempts it's just damage control!

All based on the campaign game: Tanks don't need fuel anymore, and you don't need to control zones to recieve the points or use the re-inforcing areas. I think the fuel is a bit of a shame, don't miss having to defend lots of stupid places for cmmd points though!

Reinforcements come in waves now which get released and when you pick items it's much more interesting, fewer good units earlier in each battle.

"The OMSI Omnibus Simulator returns for another trip through the congested streets of Berlin. It’s one of the most realistic bus simulators you will ever have the chance of playing, unless you have driven an actual bus that is. Instead of taking place during the early 1980’s like the previous version, OMSI 2 takes place in Germany during the late 80’s, early 90’s around the time the Berlin wall fell. Since the gameplay is unscripted, you are given the freedom to choose your bus, the bus route and the weather conditions. There are no guidelines to follow; you are given the freedom to do as you wish. The feeling of freedom is present as you drive through Germany from one destination to another, dropping your customers off at their locations. For a change of pace, it felt good not having a story to follow or missions to complete.

OMSI 2‘s gameplay can overwhelm the player in the beginning, but as long as you use the provided tutorial system, you’ll be driving through Germany in no time. It’s possible to play the game if you decide to skip the tutorial but you will need prior knowledge of the previous game to do that. There are far too many instruments to use and procedures to remember, it’s very similar to piloting a plane in a flight simulator.

The in-game physics are incredibly realistic as you can almost ‘feel‘ every bump and turn you make.  Squeaks, squeals and rattles are heard from inside the bus every time you step on the break, hit a speed bump or even put on the parking brake. OMSI 2 is optimized for a steering wheel configuration, but this can be compromised with a keyboard/mouse combination.
OMSI 2 is an in-depth simulator that is not only complex, but entertaining to play, it may take the casual gamer a bit longer to grasp the game’s complexity, but with some patience it can be done.",True
"When I first purchased this game, I was very concerned when I read all the reviews. I should have known better than to purchase a game without reading the reviews. As stated by the reviews, the game was unplayable due to excessive bugs and lag when first downloaded. However, one thing that I have found very strange about this game is that the more you play it and the more you explore, the less likely bugs are to occur (kindof like the exact opposite of [i]Minecraft[/i]). IDK if this happens on everyone's computer or if it is just a wierd quirk of mine, and I have no idea how this could happen in terms of programming, but for about the last hour of playtime (about at 10ish hrs.), I have never seen any lag or not registering clicks to the degree that I first experienced it in the game. I still have some pretty significant trouble with the game not registering my mouse clicks, but it has become at least playable, and the problem is now only a minor annoyance, unlike the total hairpulling frustration upon first download. Sometimes, due to lag, it still registers that I clicked on something that I moused over earlier, rather than what I actually have my mouse over at the time of the click. I wonder if a similar phenomenon caused the programmer(s) to think that the bugs were fixed when they were unable to reproduce reported bugs. 

If you have the patience for the bugs, the game itself isn't too bad. The ability to adjust your species for tactical, RP, or mixed  gameplay allows you to play a species according to your own interpretation of how they are or what they could be. I prefer a much more strategic and magical Vulfen to the brutish, early-game swarmers version that they are set to by default (retaining their militaristic tendancies, because IMO Vulfen aren't really Vulfen if they are too peaceful, but upon player preferance this could be changed too). It does have a fairly [i]Star Trek[/i]/[i]Babylon 5[/i] type feel, which I very much appreciate. Diplomacy is critical, and there is a high degree of intrigue involved (though taking the few abilities and technologies for intrigue that exist will make it very simple, as max rank agents can pretty much do as they please at this point, only occasionally getting discovered or even foiled but not killed). Players should keep in mind, however, that there are few guides to this game, and the videos that are out there regarding this game often do not involve enough information to really give you the feel for things. With no tutorials missions, you will likely be completely lost in the beginning, even with deep research. For this reason, I would advise setting up your first species to give you a large margin for error. Additionally, I found race customization to be very confusing initially, but once you get it, it is very straightforward. 

I have come to enjoy the game in time, but I cannot bring myself to recommend this game for its current price. It is simply too high.",False

I get to play as a powerful assassin woman and was surprised to find that my choices matter, that there's so much to do in this pretty world, and that I could make polyamorous bisexual love with many characters.

[b] Long version: [/b] 
I love this game so much and it has perfected a lot that the previous games in the series lack. (I've played AC 2, and Unity in addition to Odyssey). I continue to be surprised with how much this game has to offer, and I genuinely can't believe this game is priced at $60 (I got it on sale, but it feels like it should cost so much more). The new game mode they introduced felt more rewarding too, where you have to discover things sometimes rather than being given a simple map marker.

I bought the standard edition and I still haven't run out of stuff to do, but at this rate, I probably will buy the DLC eventually because I'm having so much fun. Your quest queue soon fills with many quests that aren't reasonably accessible until later (though it won't stop you from trying). Leveling up feels like an accomplishment, but it also doesn't take forever. And each quest you have levels up with you, they usually stay no lower than -2 of your level (so if you're at level 20, the lowest level quest listed will usually be 18). 

It's wonderful to finally be able to play as a woman in a flagship AC game. And you can romance many different folks of various genders! Yay lesbian and bisexual visibility! Also the game itself is hecking gorgeous, makes me really appreciate that I have a dedicated graphics card, but unless I try to stream it, the performance is quite good even when on higher settings. [spoiler] The ship you command has a crew that sings when you sail! It's wonderful! [/spoiler] You also have the opportunity to customize your gear, more than I've ever seen, and there's no limit to upgrading your favorite weapons!

Also, with regards to bugs, I have only encountered one, and it didn't detract from the gameplay (some bandits were alerted when I moved to a specific place, but it sent them away from me? Also it only happened in one bandit camp). Mods are also available on NexusMods for this game, which I am always a fan of. 

The game does push some Uplay stuff and you don't have to do it, but if you do, you can get some cool rewards and I'm glad I did.",True

"I wasn't sure what to expect, as I love Norse mythology, but was a bit hesitant due to the type of game: while I'm a bit sucker for adventure games, I'm not fond of the first person. which means Myst-like games, visual novels, hidden object and so on.

Great graphics, amazing soundtrack (especially the sung parts), a ton of Norse mythology lore and references, and all voices in Norse language all contribute to an amazing experience.

"=TL;DR=
+ Story and theme: 13/37 (jk, I'd give it a 9/10)

+ Mechanism and gameplay: 1/10 due to lots of issues + early access.

Come back when the game is fully developed. 
The game has potential but right now it's pretty disappointing, sorry.
=======


= Pros =

+ Decent story (despite being short)

+ Pretty well-themed for that hacker feeling (the keystroke and mouse click sound)

+  Intriguing and fun to play for people into and not into IT.

+ [spoiler]""One windows reinstall later...""[/spoiler]

= Cons =

+ Figuring out the controls for this game is even harder than doing the real thing itself.
   Tutorial is even harder and more annoying than the minigames.

+ the log-in screen does not match with the OS (clearly Windows 7 or later but log-in screen is Windows XP, lol)

+ [strike]You can do anything[/strike] You can't do a lot of things.
    You can't right click, can't copy-paste, you can't even drag/drop windows or open multiple ones at a time.

    In short, you can't do a lot of things that you normally can when you mess around with the OS (yet).
    Also, you can type lots of stuffs in cmd other than just ""connect [IP Address]"" like in the tutorial.
    The thing is that the game doesn't let the player experiment / play around with the environment (just for now, I guess).


+ The typing mechanism is pretty silly. So, you basically just mash your keyboard randomly to ""type"" out anything in the game. I understand that you aren't allowed to type anything invalid, but there is a better approach to this.


+ there are many many bugged parts (must be due to Early Access).
   E.g. sometimes when the player faces the request in the email, declining that request would send them onto the next chapter rather than progressing the game with that choice.


+ The music seems okay at first, but gets boring and tiring to hear pretty quickly. (And there aren't any options to mute the music)
    Not to mention how the music play-back is bugged if you return to the main menu and pick a different chapter or start a new game, the music might be played twice at the same time (I almost got a headache from that)
    Better yet, there aren't even options to change the game from fullscreen -> windowed -> windowed full, etc.

= Suggestions  (other than fixing the persisting bugs) =

+ There should be a setting menu to change the music/ sfx volume, languague, screen resolution, everything.

For the typing mechanism:
+ Letting the player know what they're supposed to type could be an approach.
   There could be a block of faded text showing what's supposed to be there. The player can type anything they want, as well as being able to use function keys like Ctrl, Shift, Enter, Delete, etc.

BUT,  the game would only advance if everything was typed correctly, else alert the player with a text box or something like ""Oops, something isn't right."".

For customization:
+ The current wallpapers are a-okay, tho. I have nothing against them. But if the player can change the wallpaper, that'd be awesome. 

+ There should be an option to choose or play your custom music, like, REAL sound files in your system (kinda like an option to import / locate the music folder in your computer).

In short, since this is game is gonna be a simulation, it'd be amazing if the player felt like they're hacking with their own OS other than just playing a game.

Welp, that's it for now. Loads of issues.
But don't get me wrong, tho. This game seems nice and I trust that it'd turn out to be awesome.

There are essentially no instructions/explanations in the game.  There are two 'programming modes' one disparagingly called kids mode, which it is apparently not possible to complete the game with.  And another that requires you to type out commands (which I'm ok with since I type quickly) however.

"TL;DR Version: Game is great, story is great, deliah is great, graphics are amazing. Other reviewers dont see whole picture, and just rush. They don't see the replayabilty that is in this game. 

Long version:
I had to rewrite my review for people to understand something. The story is linear, to a point yes, but there are so many things people are not seeing. So many different dialog options are in the game from doing something you didn't even think would cause something. Deliah was mad at me for throwing someones electronics in the river, i didn't mean too, i thought what would be the worse thing to happen. It changed dialog later, there is even other reports of people putting photos and wedding rings in a drawer, and getting different dialog outcomes, even in the ending. You can not tell deliah things. Even to a point where the ending is effected. People dont think about the little actions, those little actions where you can say, what the hell, what's the worse that can happen, or where you take instructions the wrong way, and take everything where you were suppose to take one. 

The game is beautiful, the dialog is beautiful, deliah is an amazing character that helps you throughout your way in the game. The story is even really great, some people say they dont like the story because it's too short, because they rushed point to point, most likely missing things, those little things. Even the developers said there is a secret ending in the game, that most people probably wont see. This is not some AAA 8-150 hour game, thats worth $60 +40 for dlc. Its a 20 dollar 3-4 story based game.
One thing i will admit is that the ending did fall a little flat to me, but that possiblity of that secret ending keeps me going, one of the dialogs in the game for the main ending is ""What if we missed something?"". Let that sink in. What if something WAS missed that caused you not to see that secret ending, what did you do wrong during your playthrough that didn't cause you to see this ending? 

This is something i definitely recommend. Something to get away from all those other game for a while.",True

"TL:DR
I recommend this game 10 Billion % 

I originally bought this game on switch on sale for about 15 dollars physical. I soon realized that the switch ver is the worst possible ver of this game and even then I found it fun as hell. 

This game is honestly what I would deem a very fun but casual anime fighting game that has a bit of depth. The combos them selves are fairly basic and once you understand its limitations it can open up a whole host of options for your characters that can get really aggressive very fast.

Would be like if mortal kombat was a anime fighter instead of what it is. There is a block button, a throw button, and super button among other dedicated buttons that make the curve very straight forward but also really annoying for veteran players. I hate that there's a dedicated block button but honestly, after a few games it didn't bother me as much anymore

The damage in this game can seem like its on the low side for some combos but it's actually fairly high and the damage is shared between the two characters. The only way to win is to end it with a super. I've never actually won by chip damage so im not sure if that's possible.

The combo system has next to no limitations. There is limitations just that it's so lax that you can really enjoy just doing combos abusing the system and it's very satisfying each time. I think this game is still too expensive even during a steam sale. I bought the game during this steam sale for 30 bucks with all the dlc characters but I wish the game was closer to 15 dollars with that dlc. 

The con to this game like every snk game is that there is no online environment because no one plays the game. Even though you get all the stuff because of that makes it hard to recommend as there is no one to play with. Luckilly I have friends who play games with me and with steam remote play only one of us needs to own the game to enjoy

"With a name like ""An Octave Higher"" it had best deliever some beautiful sounds. To that, I can attest it does.

The soundtrack is one of the storgest points of this visual novel, but happily, it's not it's only strength.

The art is rather well styled and the colors chosen are pretty.

The characters are fairly extreme in all of their roles, however, this plays well to the story and it's themes.

I would love to play a tabletop rpg in the same setting as this game. The world made of steam and magic is one I would like to explore more. It has some of the best world design ive seen in a long while, featuring an arisotcrat society, high class, and the prolaterian society.

The game itself has lots of bugs which is expected for a Early Access but the bugs can easily be fixed over time.

I myself have only found one game breaking bug in which my character got stuck in his house door (this was at the very start of a new game so I lost no progress) 

Ever since the game has been fine and I've taken up the life of a theif and a robber... or a house burner maybe for that family that hates my stealing habits. I've married a woman who's like 20 years older than me.. annnnnnd we have a son.

This game has lots of potential for the future. For now it has about a few hours of fun and some achievements to grab. It's pretty fun and of course I do recomend this game. 

Hope this helped.",True
"Price paid: $8.69

This game is really fun, and I do recommend it, but I wish the devs invested a little more time into polishing it. I'm playing it over a year after release and there are still quite a few issues. One game-breaking bug so far, and then just a bunch of UX/design issues.

PSA (minor early game spoilers):

[spoiler]Within your first hour or so, a ghost will tell you to dig up a grave and throw the body into the river. When you do this, make sure you go to the river to the west of your home and there's actually a prompt to throw it into the river when you're just a little below the broken bridge. The first time I did this, I hadn't explored west yet, and ended up going all the way east to another body of water. I managed to throw the body in the water but it didn't disappear, yet it was too far away to reach to pick up again. This prevents further progress because you will never be brought another body while one is already out. The corpse decays to 0% and stays there. Thankfully, it occurs early enough in the game that it didn't totally ruin my fun. I caught up to where I was in less than an hour after restarting. Still, extremely frustrating, and I found multiple reports of it online but apparently it was never fixed.[/spoiler]

Beyond that, this is a game where, if you don't look anything up, you will probably spend a good amount of time wondering what to do next. I don't like this, so when I need a hint, I'll look up where I'm at and what I should be working toward. Then, the next frustrating thing is that so many interactions can only happen a certain day of the week, so you end up killing time waiting around for that. [strike]And, the only way to ""kill time"" is to use up your energy intentionally (by doing things like chopping trees) and then sleeping until your energy is full.[/strike] It's not exactly fast. I realize this is part of the ""challenge"" of the game, but it also makes it tedious...they should find another way to accomplish this goal without making it tedious.

Edit: I just found an in-game place next to your house (available from game start, so no spoiler) that lets you rest even when your energy isn't low. This passes time more quickly. This at least partially addresses the above issue, but could still be designed better.

Still, overall I'm having fun and am looking forward to playing more. I'm breaking out pen & paper for this one, to keep track of all of the goals I have. The UI does this for you to some extent, but there are many places where you need specific ingredients to make something, and that's in a different location than where you produce those ingredients, so there's a lot of running back and forth and you risk forgetting what you needed.",True

"This is the realistic medieval game I've been waiting for, for so long. Warhorse has done a great job and you can really tell how much passion they put into this project. 
-So many immersive elements and mechanics in the game, along with many ways to play. 
-Somewhat linear but very strong main story for those that want some structure, but also countless entertaining side stories that really seem to matter and learn about some interesting characters (fight a priest, and then get drunk with him and score some wenches, then help him conduct a sermon the next morn.)
-Amazing believable character-building. Your character literally starts out as a talent-less peasant, and learns new skills as he performs them. Except, at the same time you are learning as well. A great example of this is the combat: in the beginning of the game you have to play careful and safe, perhaps even dirty to stay alive. But as you learn how the system works, and your character learns new moves he also gets stronger and faster as he grows accustomed to combat as well. I've honestly never seen anything like it.
-Great support after launch, new DLC coming very soon and free options like the new hardcore mode have me psyched to come back already.

Yeah, this game did have some minor problems at launch and I was there for that. I experienced my fair share of oddities but I never had any serious problems that distracted me from having a blast becoming immersed in this medieval world. The saves took a bit to get used to but I prefer how they did it, I'm really sick of autosaves in games and they gave a very creative alternative to saving that I appreciated for sure. 

All in all, this is a wonderful true-to-form medieval rpg that will scratch the itch of those who want a realistic traipse into a historical medieval world; from wonderful parties and celebrations in magnificent castles to gritty, downtrodden villages and blood, sh*t and murder.

"Quite a good game, honestly; and a worthy addition to the Halo franchise. Cinematics are excellent, voice acting is great--it fundamentally and thematically feels like something that fits into the Halo universe. The game itself is deceptively difficult, being one of those 'easy to learn but hard to master' types. It's easy at first, and challenging once you get into the campaign, but it'll absolutely curbstomp you on higher difficulties if you don't know what you're doing or you're caught with your pants down. 
There's a wide array of base units which can further be augmented by numerous upgrades and abilities, and each faction has its own unique playstyle. Leader abilities such as the MAC blast, which is an AOE attack, and the Pelican transport, which allows troops to be ferried from one place to another quickly, add a whole new dimension to the game. 
The high point of this title for me though is the campaign. It's an absolute blast in the way it's presented, and each level/scenario is both different and actually very fun. 
The main downside though is the control system--you can tell that this was a console port, and a kinda lazy one at that. It's a bit clunky in the way that it has you zoom in and out and swap between units, and you can't assign them to number keys for whatever reason. The small bit of good news in this regard is that you *can* rebind keys though, so that's something, at least.",True

"Titan Quest is an exact copy of Diablo II. Look at the Region for both games and they are nearly indetically even if you ad Immorthal Throne or Lord of Destruction its nearly the same BUT Titan Quest is 3D and the maps are not random generated.
I like DIablo II also but the settings of TQ, i like them more.

With the Ragnarök DLC we now have 10 Masteries to choose, Donar is Thor and Wodan is Odin and Loki is Loki, i like the Nordic setting.

+you can combine 2 masteries
+graphics still look good to me
+a lot of hotfixes and patches
+working multiplayer
+helpful community with problems and quests
+cool armor and weapons
+runs on a toaster
+you can become the Titan Bane and the Gods Bane
+85lvl cap
+developers still work on this game and they care
+a lot of mp servers
+a lot of mods

-only 1 core usage
-no two handed swords, axes, hammers....
-some enemys are too damn OP
-DLC has some bugs but they will get fixed fast
-shared storage is small
-Fafnir looks ugly as f***
-a lot of grinding

"There are plenty of reviews out there, so here are just a few key points:

- Some mechanics didn't translate perfectly to VR. Blocking and staggering mechanics sometimes feel unintuitive. Lockpicking is okay, and makes sense, but isn't very immersive. Needing to use the favorites menu frequently can get old.

- Most everything else feels even better in VR. Sneaking and archery both feel awesome while utilizing the advanced/physical control scheme. Magic makes you feel very powerful, and shouts are fun.

- Having life-sized NPCs interact with you is super cool. Also, you will find many of the enemies you used to encounter in ""flat"" Skyrim are much more menacing in ""real life.""

- Almost all mods are compatible with VR, and there are many QoL improvement type mods constantly being made specifically for VR that fix many issues that the game currently has. You can tune the game to your liking, and I find that many graphical mods make the game much more immersive.

- Performance is pretty dang good. I have a GTX970, and even with quite a few graphical mods it runs smoothly the majority of the time. Occasionally there might be a large amount of object/particle effects that might increase reprojection.

- You should prepare to spend a bit of time messing around with options, config files, mods, etc. It *will* take some time to get everything looking and feeling perfect, but it's totally worth it.

- Comes with all official DLC.

If you are burnt out from the original Skyrim, prepare for a whole different experience. If you haven't played the game ever, lol just prepare.",True

"As a fan on anime, manga, light novels, and visual novels, I'm well versed in many forms of these Japanese mediums.  But playing through Clannad will always be one of my most precious memories.  With an incredibly well-balanced plethora of genres, this VN has something for everyone.  Comedy, tragedy, mystery, romance, action, drama, etc..  On top of that, the visuals are stunningly beautiful, and the voice actors and actresses did a fantastic job.  The storylines are amazingly deep and interesting, and you can't help but fall in love with all of the characters.  And you can never go wrong with Jun Maeda being in charge of the musical direction.  The only bad thing I can say about it is that there are a few minor spelling and grammar mistakes.  Other than that, it is a flawless work of art.

Key Studios is famous for their visual novels, and by playing through Clannad, you will understand why.  Whether you've played hundreds of VNs or you haven't played a single one, I highly recommend Clannad to anyone and everyone.

"Edit after last patch:

Animation of your character even smoother.
-> like running is flawless now
-> fighting  feels better ( this includes also some of the enemy fight animations and reaction to you)
Shields are fixed (can take a beating now).
And females sound like females grunting and all x).
No crashing from dropping loot anymore.

Overall this is truely great they fix the overall feel of the game, aswell as getting rdy to add more stuff.

------------------------------

Personal point:
I am truely enjoying it.

Sidenote:
I might be here for the boobs, but looking at this hard working womans rough sweaty back... ugh i mean, ehh.
Its nice to have something pretty to look at, the details of characters are so neat.
Their animations look really good, 
doh jumping might be improved(i made a high tone voice female, the noises she make makes me forget this :)) 

Hardware spec, and etc.:
I use xbox controller and learning this game featured it doh not being mentioned on the store place, i jumped right into the game, and you know what?
The feel of the controls are impressive smooth(besides the dodge the left stick dodges if you doubble tap a direction, pretty neat unless your in the menu and forget to use d-pad),
 all commads are basicly there, missing only item rotaions and the map ofc.

very few crashes, im on the minimum requierments i-2500k gtx 750 ti (and 16 gb ram but their litterally so old i donnu when they will fail)

Some npc and mob animations will not show until their close, but this is early acces and im on minimum requierments so ill only mention it.

------
Edit:

I left out game play info since its explained quite forward on the store page, i found the lack of info on spec and xbox conroller info to be of the most important fact to be explained.

And my experience is on solo.

Gameplay experience.

Sofar a very decent and enjoyable game.

Yet, i can tell you sofar i've seen my feet twisted off from my dead corpse after a croc bite them off me, yet i also found it dead from the action head cracked ageinst a tree, laugh my butt off.

I have build a wastefull tower of solid stones tall as the mountain beside it, in my search of iron ores, 200 of those mind you and i got like 1 out of every 50  solid stone veins i mined (if i was lucky.. and it wasnt like every 100 sometimes),
but yeah i had fun. the tower named trump tower(just tastefull, i know), 
it gets even better, the best part of it wss that i completely forgot to check if the game had a map.. soo yeah i was like not even begon on the journay of the map.. hehe, the joy i had of venturing out being slaugthered  recollecting yourself, and learn there is a god damn  Iron Vain hehehe... i felt silly but not cheapend.

I also put down a sign, and wrote on it, ""dont put  things down before thinking"".. yeah it stands ferm to that belief both spirit and soul... 

Dont spoil the fun with the server hosting god powers(or cheat mode) i tryed it out for a min, then i forgot dropping too many items in one place might crash it, but im happy it did, my fun came from the barebone experience of survival and thats fear of death from the unknown.

Hope i didnt spoil it now.

That is just my reasonings. I really love how you can kill your target many diffrent ways and there is not just one way of doing everything. Whether it be go in silently and eliminate your target or kill every single person you see so that you can kill your target. Also with the big collection of weapons you can play with you can either do melee attacks which is my favorite, esspecialy when you have to kill those people in that corn field. Or you can use all sorts of diffrent types of firearms.

"The game is well-designed, as far as humor goes, and its one of those brawlers that does not require an xInput controller (a rarity those days for some reason). But good things end right there.

Being a pixel-art game, it has a limited resolution and does not seem to scale well to a modern widescreen monitor, stretching instead. Why is that, I have no idea.

And the most frustrating part is the difficulty spikes in the game.
Get to the first boss and prepare to die A LOT. Every death will set you back to the very friggin' beginning of the whole game.
Turbo-mode gamepad fixes that a bit, but you will still die. Don't smash it in frustration.
It's a nostalgia trip all right - you get all those bad design decisions from the arcade era, like lives and limited ""continues"", impossible difficulties and sometimes unresponsive controls.

I never finished TMNT on my NES when I was younger. Years later I found out that the game was not impossible to beat, but it had a form of anti-piracy protection (and it turned out I was using a pirated game) that ramped up the difficulty up to 11. We did not know that. We just kept on playing, never knowing that vidogames were not about frustration.

"TL;DR: The game is hilarious, engaging, and enthralling, and is probably the greatest game I've played in the last decade.

Boy, where you do even begin with reviewing a game like this....

Undertale is an old-style RPG that refuses to take itself seriously, is damn proud of that fact, and is simply a beautiful and charming work of art.  It's precisely the sort of game that I would take joy from waving in Roger Ebert's face in an attempt to get the guy to understand and admit that video games truly are art, were Ebert still around to put up with my harassment.  Unfortunately, he's not, so I'll have to settle for dragging his name through the mud in a Steam review, instead.

Back on topic... I finished my two playthroughs of Undertale over a week ago, and I'm still somewhat in awe at it—amazed that something so phenomenal could be the product of just an artist and a preposterously talented dude.  It's the sort of thing that really makes you wonder what the hell the AAAs are doing with their huge teams and GDP-level game budgets.  How is that they've been pumping out games from their big-budget assembly lines for decades, but can't put together a game that actually makes people [i]feel[/i] things like Undertale can?  It seems so backwards, but, at the same time, it's not fair to make this review about the AAAs; Undertale is a brilliant accomplishment, no matter what it's being compared to.

Now, I've spent my opening paragraphs on slobbering over the game, but what is it that's so great about it, anyway?  Well, Undertale is incredibly funny and jam-packed with lovable characters you're not likely to forget anytime soon—special shout-out to my boys Papyrus and Mettaton!

Furthermore, Undertale's soundtrack is amazingly good and puts most of the music that you would hear on the radio—much less the music of most other video games—to shame.  The music is just [b]feel[/b] well-composed.  Since playing the game, I've been left in the state of continually listening to the soundtrack on loop and hoarding Undertale sheet music so I can play out the tunes, myself.  Does this indicate that I have a problem of some sort?  Maybe.  Or maybe it's you who has the problem, because you're not currently listening to the Undertale soundtrack.  It's not me who's missing out here!

Anyway, let's not forget about the quality of the writing, either.  The game is hilarious and witty, with writing that's probably funnier than whatever comedy show/movie/stand-up special you most recently watched, and that leaves you in constant state of wanting more.  You can rest assured, though, that, as you explore the world of Undertale, you'll find yourself in no shortage of things to chuckle about.  But it's not all laughs, either.  The game implores you to expect the unexpected at each turn, and there are some moments that really just sock you right in the feels.  At times, Undertale will encourage you to really stop and question some things (in a good way).  You might even learn something about yourself, in the process.

On top of that, despite being an RPG with a very purposeful old-timey feel, the game still manages to push boundaries with its features (e.g. there's some pretty meta stuff that goes on in the final battle), but especially in the department of RPG battle mechanics.  Indeed, the combat system is very unique for an RPG, and, unlike the antiquated RPGs of yore that Undertale so desperately wants you to believe are its kin, the combat seldom ever feels arduous.

It truly is a breath of fresh air that every enemy has their own particular strategy that is supposed to be discovered and exploited in order to defeat them, often blending together the mechanics of turn-based RPGs with shoot-em-ups (of all things) to create the Frankenstein monster's dashingly handsome twin brother of game mechanics—a combination of systems that you wouldn't have expected would work well together at all, but that actually could hardly work  [i]better[/i] together.  It's likely in large part thanks to this unique approach to RPG combat that the game continues to drive forward at all times without ever turning things into a grind, fostering a constant feeling of excitement about whatever might lie waiting around the next corner.

Now that I've sat here, lavishing the game with preposturous amounts of praise for paragraphs on end, you might be wondering if I'm not just some blind fanboy who can find no fault with Undertale and believes it to be an untainted relic of some sort, brought down to us from on high.  I will neither confirm nor deny the rumors of my fanboyism, but I honestly can't find a whole lot to complain about here.  Probably the biggest thing for me regards the game's innumerable references to Earthbound.  Don't get me wrong: Earthbound is one of my absolute favorite games, and I think that Undertale is actually the proper successor that Earthbound always deserved—and, yes, I say this as someone who has even played the ""true"" sequel to Earthbound from start to finish.  Earthbound and Undertale are both brilliant, masterful games, and shining examples of originality, wit, and humanity in video games.  Undertale is entirely deserving of any assessment that it gets that groups it together with Earthbound.

But my biggest problem with Undertale is just [b]how much[/b] it tries to associate itself with Earthbound.  It's one thing to be influenced by something and pay homage to it (as Undertale does with many other things, in tasteful moderation), but the frequency with which Undertale makes nods in Earthbound's direction is just too much for me.  There are [i]several dozen[/i] occurrences in Undertale that are references to Earthbound.  I dislike this, because Undertale is a game that is brilliant in its own right, and it really doesn't need to be leaning so heavily on Earthbound in order to stand tall as a delightfully fun experience that profoundly manifest its creators' passion and ingenuity.  This ""too many references"" problem isn't not a major point or a dealbreaker by any measure, but I just wish that the Earthbound references had been a bit fewer in number.  They simply weren't necessary, and started to take away from the game, at a point.

Anyway, the real moral of the story here is that Undertale is an game that I expect to love forever.  It's touching, incredibly entertaining, and reminds us that there's still room for innovation, even in a genre of games that's been existent and explored for some 30 odd years already.  Cherish your time with Undertale, and don't expect to see another game of its caliber anytime soon.

"I cannot yet recommend a game that was such a big departure from the original earlier on. It is slowly shaping up to the creative and quality standards I was so captivated by in the first game. It may turn out to be something like it but with the final product on the way and until I've been able to play it further as it stands I'm not ready to recommend right now.

The issues identified in prior reviews have shown improvement and I am hopeful to see continued work in this direction. This review will change to recommended if I see that the storyline and content adjustments + enhancements flow and gel well enough throughout the game. Not quite there yet.

PS If this game is new to you and you want to know if it is 'good enough to play' or cool, interesting or artistically quality, the answer is yes as of right now. For those reasons I'd say get it. Need to see a bit more to give it an overall nod.",False
"So i just finished the main story and I want to say it is extraordinary!
The gameplay is very good and it is one of my favorite zombie survival games, the story is very awesome, I love how cool this open world map feels and how good you feel killing zombies and one of my favorite things about this game is that if you tell story times with your friends it feels so good to listen to their stories while playing this game. I can't say anything bad about this game. I just hope that Dying Light 2 will be as good as this one. I didn't tried the online part yet but I will do it soon.
So in conclusion if you want to play this game, even after 6 years since it was launched, do it. It worths all the money.
Hope my review helped you.",True
"It's a good game, but not quite as perfect as people make it out to be. 8/10 sounds about right. Most of the game is great but here are my grudges:

I would critique the story for being quite one-dimensional but it takes a turn for the better after around three quarters of the game, which was fairly redeeming. 

No real puzzles
The only thing you'll ever meet is locked doors that require switches that are either (quite literally) next to the door or in the next room. If you try to go full puzzle-solver mode on anything you'll just end up complicating things for yourself. The straight forward way is always correct in this game.

Intensive hand holding
Basically EVERYTHING comes with a tutorial. You'll get a tutorial box on opening your first chest, destroying a barricade, lighting a torch... well, basically everything you press A on. At times it feels a little insulting to be tutorial'd on everything.

Weird UI decisions
Whoever came up with the idea of single-line scrolling textboxes for everything instead of just block text deserves to be stoned.

Reskinned stuff
There are only 20 or so different enemies (excluding bosses) in the game, the rest is different skins of those. They don't change sound either, which means the final dungeon of the game is filled with reskins of grubs, bees, monkeys (not kidding) and other wildlife you've been fighting all game. There are also only a handful of weapon designs, and they use reskins for the last few tiers of gear. Comes across as rather lazy.

Cheap combat mechanics
Everything has instant turn speed, which makes the big bosses (which are rather rare to be fair) nullify your mobility advantage. Also one-shots. There are no hard enemies without abilities that just roflstomp you. Just accept that you got destroyed, ressurrect and move on.",True
"Fuck this game to hell and back. Ronnie 2k deserves the biggest fuckface award by a mile. Fuck him and the greedy team that made this piece of shit game.

"Campaign Mode is a chorefest. 

I've only played Imperium so far, but the start was dreadful AND the final battle is in fact four times more  dreadful. By the time there was any focus on Titan ships like in the tutorial, 95% of the Imperium campaign was already over and done with. Seemed that the opening Imperium cinematic was the biggest lie to any hyped up player's immediate glare.

I tried to leave a system of Eldar alone after an invasion. Tyranids had just showed up and were invading everything, However all of a sudden, I'm warned that there's a Game Over condition if you let the Eldar hang around ""too long"" three times. So it turns out there was an Tyranid Invasion planned on this very Eldar system.  The TWO TURN LIMIT to stopping these ""Game Over"" events was very limiting concerning how big the sectors can be, Crossing Cadia sector takes THREE turns of moves from end to end. The strategical map should have better notices about Invasions than the hover-your-mouse-over-the-sector-map-to-display crap. The bigger your empire grew, the turns on Invasions and GAME OVER events should have grown to accommodate the match the player's sectors size. Also there should have been onetime battle plans rewards for clearing entire sectors.

Wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, but 40k fans. Everything else looks tight (40k art, 40k ship and their textures, but the music lacked in punch compared to first BGFA) except the strengths and weaknesses of Adeptus Mechanicus ( Lance spam & Nova spam, but fragile ships that were literally Navy ships recolored barring Ark Mechanicus which is still a crummy Battleship by all means. Also only the third tier of AM ships had Nova cannons) and Adeptus Astartes (Boarding spam and nice armor, but because of balance reasons the Space Marines ships were knocked down from being resilient and tough, but drifting hulks made from boarding spam explode and the SM ships are snailfully slow due to being in close range all the time to board stuff so dead SM ships and dead escorts are guarantee'd with the punishment of drifting hulks. It is not a good game to play out when you can just torpedo shit or nova spam shit to death from afar.

 I guess its a leg up from ""head to gas cloud to hide and insta-win"" that was the winning strategy of the Battlefleet Gothic Armada, but this time the ships are unbalanced off the bat, mostly due to lack of in-depth customization the first BFGA provided. Sadly SPAM of the good ships is the only choice for most players. If you're playing Multiplayer mode similar to Capture the Zones, the Dark Elder players are going to punish you hard if the zones are separated from each other.",False
"[b][i]Steampunk Tower 2[/i][/b] is an action game where you take command of Lord Bingham’s flying fortress and its battle tower in a campaign throughout Europe against the force of the Cult.

For your first couple of fights, your tower will only have two floors and only two turrets will be able to be displayed on each side. The army of the Cult will come in waves; up to 6 waves per battle. At first, you’ll fight infantries as well as some sort of flying bombs, but as you progress throughout the campaign, units the likes of tanks, helicopters and even robots will come en masse in an attempt to destroy your tower. Each of your turrets will have two gauges underneath; one will be filled in as your turret destroys enemy units, and the other represents the ammunition and will decrease until your turrets are empty. To reload the ammunition, you need to place your turret in the middle of the tower. It can become tricky when both of the turrets on the same floor run out of ammo. You can purchase super weapons before the start of each battle, in addition to a few other things that will slow down the enemy ground forces.

Graphically the game looks great and the soundtrack is pretty cool, too. You’ll be using the mouse in regards to the control. [b][i]Steampunk Tower 2[/i][/b] can get a bit repetitive but as you progress through the game new enemy units are added, which is fun and keeps you going.

"To be honest.
It IS still a noir game, despite the total change of climate.

But it just doesn't feel like a Max Payne game. It feels more like if somebody firstly made a ""Max Payne"" movie, and then made a game out of it.

I still enjoyed it, but the massive spam of cutscenes and lack of exploration (seriously, all exploration you can do is basically a break between cutscenes usually) makes it very close to a typical action game.

Also, golden guns. I liked seeing the polish of them while having them equipped, but the whole mechanism of searching for them through the entire level killed the immersion a little for me. See, you have a NPC rushing you through the whole level, while you just take a stroll around searching for parts. Jesus christ. The easter eggs in the first MPs were the best ideal of how to make people want to explore.

If you're a die-hard fan of the climate of the first MPs, you should decide whether you want to mess around for a few hours just for post-MP2 Max flashbacks and finally, a happy end for Max.

Multiplayer is a bit dead right now, so I would recommend buying this game only for singleplayer and on sales (do not buy DLCs, they do not add shit).

Oh, also. There's a cover mechanism, but I recommend to use it only during reloads or very tough fights. If you get used to quick-aiming during shootdodges, it will surely rise your enjoyment of this game.

Finally, last note: This game is a bitch to launch, just like previous MPs. Disabling AMD Gaming Evolved before playing solved the case of 75% crashes during launching, but there are many people having fairly more BS to do.",True

"Ori and the Blind Forest is a special treat.  Gorgeous environments, a compelling silent storyline, a haunting soundtrack, and velvety-smooth platform mechanics create an experience that is not to be missed.  

In this game, you spend your time as a sprite-like forest creature flying around a gorgeous forest, boosting, swinging, and climbing to solve various platformer puzzles and progress through the game.  There are enemies to fight and upgrades to unlock that increase your mobility, survivability, and offer special perks to help continue your progression.  The progression is rewarding and fun, continually offering new ways to move; by the end of the game you will feel like a true master of the mechanics, which are somehow both easy to learn and extremely rewarding.

At around 12 hours to complete the game with most unlocks, Ori and the Blind Forest is not a long game; it's more of a cinematic experience, so calibrate your expectations appropriately.  I savored this game, playing an hour or two at a time, stopping whenever I reached a major milestone or significant ability unlock.  Every time I came back, it was easy to pick up the mechanics and start whizzing around again.

I give this game a 10/10.  It has vision and it achieves that vision well.  I highly recommend everyone pick it up--it's frequently on a deep sale--and give it a shot.",True
"Hard as nails, frustrating, unfair... and loads of fun. Tonnes of replayability here, and that's before you even touch mods.

Easy mode is not easy; it will take a long time to beat.

No two games are ever the same, and there are a crapload of different weapons, systems & ships to use and discover.  Then there's the advanced mode, which adds more stuff.

If you're the kind of person who needs a ""TL;DR"" when they read text, then (a) this game is not for you, you impatient child, and (b) you should be ashamed of yourself.

"Short version: too many cut scenes.

The original Max Payne was obviously good, that's why it spun off all the sequels. You were a lone cop shooting up bad guys in bullet time amongst a mafia run, slightly dysoptian NYC. I mean, that's just a classic recipe for solid gaming. This game however, has gone a little too off the bread and budder. It's more of an interactive movie than a game. The cut-scenes with too much stupid dialogue and really forgetable characters are very jarring. You can never actually play the game because a stupid cut-scene will ensure you never get more than 1-2 minutes of playtime.

Second, somehow the gun-play seems worse than in the original. The original, it felt more like you were really shooting up bad guys. This one, too much hiding behind cover. I know, it's more realistic, a guy jumping around and kicking down doors is more likely to die than a guy who hides behind cover. But so what, the original was just so much better gameplay-wise.

Finally, the overall story. Who the fuck cares about some random brazallian family? They could all die of a stroke and it wouldn't phase me. Max's story is at least some what interesting as it develops along the typical protagonist/antogonsit story. But some stupid rich brazillian family?? Why would I care??",False

- Adding different classes / periods (like Musical Theatre or a Fitness Center / Gym)
- Adding after-school programs
- Adding Car or Bus Drop-Off zones for students
- Adding BENEFICIAL character traits for students (Like ""genius"" or ""fast-walker"")

"Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game. As compared to Capitalism II, the economy here is strange, frustrating, and down right illogical. For example, I am making 100 Quality Flu Vaccine and almost have a complete monopoly on it, however, if I charge more than 2 dollars from the production price, people stop buying. Then suddenly, a competitor releases a 1 Quality Flu Vaccine which is 4 dollars cheaper and he suddenly cornered 1/3 of the market. 
One more way this game frustrates me is that it feels like it punishes me for having the highest quality goods. I max out the quality and I am not allowed to have a large profit margin, if I sell at a much higher price than my production costs, no one buys it. That means no matter how much effort I put in to lowering production costs, my selling price will have to lower with it. With over a dozen different products, I can't seem to go over a steady 10,000 dollars a day in profits while maitaining 100 quality goods and a research team that keeps me on top.
While the stock market is simpler and easier to use in this game than Capitalism II, there doesn't seem to be any dividends given out so I don't see point in buying shares of competitors unless I want to outright buy them out. I didn't get a chance to try as it felt futile even after buying 20 percent of a competitor.
Resource production does not have too much of a benefit. The only one I saw was the assurance that you don't run out from the global market. But, as stated above, having cheap raw materials cuts down on production and you are forced to lower your selling price because if your profit margin is large, people stop buying. 
Finally, after 15 in game years, the demand for products we the same, no increase or decrease.
There are many things in this game that are great improvements over Capitalism II but no, sorry. I still prefer Capitalism II. If you have not played that game, you will probably be less disappointed with this game.",False

"Tl:dr; It's epic, intense, extremely detailed and takes a while to learn.

Do you cringe to see your RTS tanks and helicopters move at the same speed? Do you want a modern style RTS on a big scale? Do you want semi-realistic ranges, strength and fighting power for anti-air, vehicles, tanks, infantry? Look no further. 

Wargame has (to me) been the breath of fresh air the RTS genre sorely needed. It's on a massive scale, and allows you to zoom out to see the entire map, but you can also zoom in to follow a particular unit in incredible detail. 

This game has been around for a while, but thanks to the community, the devs are still working on putting new nations out. 
Next to the positive things mentioned above, here are a few things you should consider before buying:
-The scale works both ways, it's easy (as a beginner) to get stomped by something you didn't know existed.
-The learning curve is very steep in the beginning, know that you need to make your own unit deck, since the default ones are useless.

"Can give you hours of entertainment, however, the amount of hours don't add up to finishing the game.  It get's dry and you feel like you are just grinding.  There isn't much evolution in combat, so it feels about the same later in the game as it does in the begining.  I find no advantage between classes.  If you can't swing a weapon (warrior), you aren't going to last long.  Magic doesn't do more damage, and I find it usually does significantly less.  Yes, there are places you can steal if you are a thief, but making money isn't hard, so you are giving up your ability to fight by building the steath skills.  Storyline isn't very complex.  Quests from one dude feel about the same as a quest from anyone else.  Quests don't add much to the game's feel either.  You just have an alternate reason to run around and kill everything you see.

"[h1] A Mess of a Game [/h1]

[b]WARNING - LONG REVIEW[/b] 

Playing the Surge is an exercise in frustration. I see a game that has so much potential squandered by bad game design and decision making from the developers. Some argue that you can't compare Surge to Dark Souls. I disagree. The game markets itself as being similar to Dark Souls, the second game from the studio that gave us Lords of the Fallen, and it uses similar game design. Comparing the Surge to Dark Souls is like comparing Diablo to Titan Quest. Its a valid comparison, in my opinion, and shouldn't be scoffed at. 

OVERVIEW: The best way to describe The Surge is simplified sci-fi Dark Souls. Less time needed for completion (20-30 hours) and less complicated RPG mechanics. 

Positives: 

+	The Setting: I adore sci-fi. Aesthetically speaking, Surge delivers on the promise of sci-fi souls-like. You play in a huge industrial complex wearing a giant exo-suit wielding various weapons that look like someone attached a welding torch to metal rebar. The designs look awesome and the exo-suits look great.

+	Combat: For the most part, combat is fun. Surge emphasizes speed and raw aggression, encouraging the player to dodge attacks and chain together combos to take down enemies. Combat has a good rhythm of dodging and attacking and is quite addicting. Deck 13 also does a great job communicating the weight and momentum behind the attacks. When you move, dodge, or swing a weapon, you can feel it. Its hard to explain but its there.

+	RPG progression is fairly well-done. You collect tech scrap (EXP) and level up. You can collect implants as you explore the world, which you can equip to give you various active and passive buffs. You can also mix and match armor/weaponry to fit your preferences. It’s fairly easy to find a loadout that you like and fits your playstyle. 

Average: 

~     Technically speaking, the game has good graphics and voice acting. Nothing noteworthy but worth mentioning nonetheless. The graphics and art direction don't really shine through due to the commitment to the realistic setting and 99% of the game taking place indoors. I think if they had taken more risks with the art direction or went for a more stylized art style, then this game would be a lot more visually striking. 

The Negatives:
 
-	The Setting: So I said I love the sci-fi setting, so what gives? Well the problem is the industrial setting that you see is the entirety of the game. During your entire 20-30 hour playthrough you’re stuck in the same factory, going through the same environments, fighting the same couple types of enemies. It’s beyond lazy and it gets old very quickly. In other games, you’ll explore different locations and areas and fight new types of enemies. No such luck here. There is little variation here at all. You'll be walking through the same non-descript tunnel with industrial pipes for a few dozen hours. Rooms look so same-y and generic you'll easily find yourself lost as you try to navigate the map. And this is without mentioning that you *will* be revisiting the same maps over and over. You’ll be fighting the same exo-suit zombies throughout the game interspersed with machines here there, all of which attack and behave the same. They could’ve spiced it up by adding a cryo-cooling location, a boiler area, maybe some greenhouse and aquatics locations, but nope. There’s very little imagination or creativity here with the sci-fi setting and it shows. 

-	The Difficulty: Let’s be clear, difficulty is not a bad thing. In fact, I love Souls-like games partly *because* of the difficulty. But there’s a difference between ‘hard’ and ‘frustrating’. The Surge is overwhelmingly the latter. Most enemies in the game can kill you in one or two hits, leaving no room for error. Health bars are way too big. You will die constantly and often to even the most mundane of enemies, even if you’re a good player. Enemy placement is also awful, placing them in cramped corridors and small rooms with very little room to maneuver or dodge. Rarely have I felt that my death was a learning experience or my own fault. As a result, killing a simple trash mob takes too long, and is too risky, too monotonous, and too frustrating. Even grinding is useless; since enemies will scale with your level. So what’s the solution? Running through the level. Chances are, you’ll find yourself running through the level ignoring enemies entirely, simply because you can’t be bothered to kill them. Its just not worth it. Why should I waste time killing an enemy when avoiding them is less risky and avoids the hassle of dealing with them entirely? Why should I bother to kill an enemy and level up if they're going to just scale with me? This is a classic case of bad game design that encourages negative player behavior. 

-	Poor Decisions: Some of the decisions that Deck 13 made with this game utterly baffle me. For example, the timer to regain your lost tech scrap. As with any souls-style game. You kill an enemy and gather EXP in the form of tech scraps. If you die, you drop them and you have one chance to go and reclaim them. If you die again, they’re gone forever. It’s a wonderful concept. So what does Deck 13 do? Well, in what I can only describe as one-upmanship, they added a timer to regain your lost EXP. When it runs out, the tech scrap is gone forever. This is a remarkably dumb idea simply because it doesn’t make sense. Is the game not hard enough without having to add that one extra hassle for the player? In some cases, you’ll have no chance to even regain your EXP because you can’t physically get to your EXP fast enough before the timer runs out. One could argue, you can kill enemies to increase the timer. But as I mentioned before, killing enemies is too risky and too time-consuming. So once again, you’re running through the level, ignoring the game just so you can reclaim your 22,000 tech scrap before it’s gone. But you can’t, because you don’t have enough time. So you just lost all your hard work. This is difficulty for the sake of difficulty, not because it makes sense or is fun. 

-	Characters/Story: This is just plain forgettable. A interesting concept and strong introduction falls aparts faster than a sand-castle in a tsunami. The story is bland and poorly told with Evil Corp (TM) being evil and blaring propadanda in your ears the entire time. Interesting characters are non-existent. Warren, your player character, is a generic middle-aged white dude who does the protaganist thing because the game said so. Let me make this clear, if you’re going to take away character creation to make us play as a named character then give them a fucking personality. Make us actually care about them, give them motivations, likes, dislikes, anything. Nioh did this and Surge did this and its honestly very annoying.

As I said before. The Surge has potential and I do think that Deck 13 are capable of putting together a great game. But this isn't it. One can hope they make a sequel and take feedback into account in the future. I hope in a couple years we see a Surge 2 that delivers on the promise of this concept. For now, play something else.",False

It will take some time to get to know the maps and all the possible strategies. But you will get better with every round and you will learn a lot from your team and your enemies.

"The simple question everyone wants to have answered: Is this game worth buying?
The answer is >>> NO <<< .

First of all, it's the port of a 0,99€ phone app. Charging 14€ for that seems preeeeetty harsh to me. But hey, maybe it's actually worth the money?

The game is an advanced version of the old Flashgame Pandemic II, which was a great game of it's time and I truly enjoyed playing it. Actually, that's the only reason I decided to get Plague Inc anyways. Now, Plague inc is a bit more advanced then Pandemic, no doubt. The mutations system ismore complex, the graphics and algorythms much superb...
But it doesn't add much else.Once you figured out the basic route, the game is literallyjust clickclickclick-wait-win. Every single time. The different plague types only change that at a minimal level.

Look at my game time. I havejust finished the game, unlocking the cheat plagues (those giving you godmode anti-cure or unlimited evolution points). How? Just by doing the same thing a dozen times over again, with every plague the game offered.
And that's it. And they charge 14€ for that.

Now, a big point for me was the Multiplayer mode. I could really see potential replayability value there...
BUT it's not even remotely implemented yet. 


So, my resume: Great concept (duh, they imported it from a great and innovative old game). Fun gameplay. But goddamn repetitive and no further content to keep you playing. In it's current state, 2-3€ sounds like a nice price. If they really go up ahead and add a GOOD multiplayer mode, I'll gladly change my review. But till then, don't buy this.


PS: Quick update:
They STILL didn't add the promised multiplayer, but instead keep throwing in 'more different plagues' that play usually exactly like any of the others, adding nothing new to the game.

PSPS: 6 months later, they ACTUALLY added a multiplayer. Albeit I feel trolled by the fact it's not the 'human vs virus' multiplayer I was actually hoping for.",False

"hard to get into but pretty fun

"This game is really amazing, the depth is there but you are not required to get into it.  As fun as any survival game but without the repetitive zombie theme, instead you get a nice change with the sci-fi theme that brings crazy scenery, plants, bugs and even a somewhat scary enemy.  jEven at the early stage of alpha this game is currently in there is so much to do, once you figure out how to do something you will quickly be finding more and more to do and before you know it you have played for 6 hours.  You might think you would have gotten alot done in that time, well not likely the map in this game.....its enormous.  But for good reason, there is a creation system in the game that allows you to create; like actually ""create"" your own vehicles.  You get the basic guts and mechanical stuff, then you get to completely design the body, style, gun placement, how many wheels etc etc.  

The creation doesnt just apply to vehicles and aircrafts but you also get the option to completely create your own sword, shield and gun designs.  Now you might think that leads to overpowered stupid looking junk that everyone will be using, wrong the creation system requires you to gather the materials you build with and it will take some trial and error before you really get what you want.  Its simple yet still very detailed when you want it to be, granted there is a short learning curve but those who would enjoy the game will have no problem with that.

After watching some videos I recently came to realize there is a glider backpack and a grappling hook in the game that you can aquire somehow.  So far I have only played the story mode and that has taken quite a bit of time to learn and make a small amount of progress through.  So I have not had the thril of jumping off high mountain tops and gliding around this enormous map, or using the grappling hook to climb insane mountains.  I have only seen video of the aircrafts you can potentially design and I cannot wait to design my own.  

The game is every bit worth the $24.99 price tag and to think its only in the alpha stages.  I cannot wait to see what else they add to this game, I unfortunately do not have the internet access to use the multiplayer feature but exploring this massive world with all the options they give you would be alot of fun with a friend or two.  I look forward to the future of this game and hopefully you will take the time to immerse yourself and enjoy the adventure that is available in Planet Explorers.",True

From previews, it looks like any other ordinary RPG, and let's face it: I'm a bit tired of fanmade post Yume-Nikki fight-to-the-death-for-the-spookiest-plot-twist games. The story is engaging, the characters are well-written with interestingly realistic backstories, and everytime you think you're on the right path, you find out you're not. It's incredibly challenging at times, which can sometimes be distressing for the gamer playing it for the story. But nonetheless, It's no doubt a beautiful and unique game.",True

If you're coming into this game looking for something that exists in the spirit of Yume Nikki with the same kind of mystery and tension the original game had, this is probably a good game to play. It's relatively short and it's more of a puzzle-platformer than the exploration game that the original was, and it does have some technical issues plaguing it, but it's a good experience overall. The game it atmospheric, the puzzles are interesting, the dream worlds are relatively big but not overwhelming.

I, personally, am satisfied with the experience, especially considering this is the only thing we've gotten from Kikiyama in over a decade. It could have been improve and it could be bigger, but I don't really expect something as extensive and cult as YN to be remade as a triple A title.",True

Not to mention the countless of references to other games and media that's been shown over the last decade. I'm sure you'll see a reference here and there that you'll recognize. This game makes any run feel new and fresh because of the endless possibilities and combination of items. 

I've been playing this game since 2014 I'd say, sure my hours don't show that and that's because I originally pirated the game on my trash laptop because I didn't have enough money to actually buy the game but a bit later-on I deleted the game because I was gonna actually buy it this time and so I ended up buying the game for Nintendo Switch (with all DLC included) because I saw that my GameStop had it for Switch and then finally in 2021 I ended up getting a gaming PC and so you can probably guess what happened next, I bought the game and all of it's DLC for my PC.

"This game is addictive. It's amazing. It's tense, if you want, or you can stay safe and just build.

Honestly, it took a while to get into, but once you hit 999 of each major material, you start to feel the true freedom in the game. Also, you cannot play it full screen because nothing is fully explained or taught, so the wiki was constantly open for me to double check how to make something or what something was.

Once I passed that hurdle and got used to switching windows (the game pauses while you do so, thankfully), I've spent about 8 hours a day every day playing it, and dream of builds to make or what to work on next to get materials or improve my house or find new biomes or on how to prep for tackling the next boss ---

"There has been plenty of Batman games ever since the franchise first took off, many of those games fell into either an action adventure or a side scrolling beat-em-up arcade game. 

When Arkham Asylum first came on to the scene, it changed a lot of what we expect for Batman games. Unfortunately the design and game mechanics were so popular at the time of release that it simply encouraged game developers to continue to copy the play mechanics for every iteration going forward. 

While this is an enjoyable game, that doesn't mean there aren't glairing issues with the product. The biggest being that it's simply a mimic of it's predecessors. You really aren't going to find anything new or unique with the game if you've played the previous installments.

""Detective Mode"" can be a frustrating experience. It often involves you just wandering around a crime scene, scanning objects until you meet a certain percent of the current investigation and then using Batman's seemingly magical technology to reconstruct the crime scene, to the point you can even reward and fastforward it. It's tedious and boring. It would have been better if they had just changed these into cutscenes or something. As it is right now, the only thing I can see this mechanic as, is filler to pad out the length of the game. 

Combat can be satisfying at times, but relies on a lot of context senestive situations and as a result, players are often going to just find themselves mashing buttons instead of engaging in any sort of meaningful combat. This problem is often compounded by the fact most boss fights in this game are really nothing more than a series of quick time events.

It's not a bad game by any means, but it features many repetitive mechanics in the game that can make it long winded and tedious. If you are a fan of the other games, it's likely you'll enjoy this one too, but I recommend you wait to buy this game until it's on sale.",True

If you're an avid fan of the Mad Max movie series and TM you will definatelly find yourself buying this game at one point or another, an expansive open world leaves you to enjoy the universe of Mad Max, the cars, the madness, fights and unique characters to interact with.

Pro's:
-Open world(very large world at that).
-Nailed the setting of a post-apocalyptic world
-Beautiful candy graphics.
-Excelent car combat
-Fairly decent CQC.
-Great sound system.

Con's:
---------------
-Lack of story depth(it's there a story that is but could have been easily had been expanded upon).
-Repetitive, Repetitive, Repetitive(Don't get me started it is repetitive).
Lack of Day/night cycle swap/wait system(there is a Day/Night cycle in the game and it's amazing the issue is that there is no option to wait through them, which some mission tasks require a specific time of the day, forcing you to wait in real life up to 2 hours for a swap).
-Rather Poor car drive handling  on some car's(or rather the handling of them is blatantly random).


Overall Rating from me is 7/10(and that's also cause am a fan of Mad Max Movies/Graphic Novels the works)

If you want to play a game set in a post-apocalyptic environment or put yourself in the shoes of Max in a rather chillout relaxin manner or just for a random drive in said world without any pre-set objectives then it's a good game to have.

Enjoy.

"So I bought CastleMinerZ in the early 2014s thinking ""Hey I have played this game on xbox and it was fun so I should get it on the computer."" I played for 1 hour and after that hour got up and deleted it off my desktop and walked away. One day I was bored and redownloaded this game and decided to give this game 1 hour to prove it's worth of 5 dollars. I sat down watched it download and pressed play. Lets just start off by saying I play CSGO, in CSGO I have my sensitivity at around 1.30-1.40. This game dosen't let you change your sensitivity at all. I'm basicly walking around while my mouse goes zooming around my screen at the slightest of movement. Don't even get me started on the nasty sounds or the hardcore amounts of damage you take along with the insane HP regen. The game is basicly a damn port from the xbox but somehow is WORSE than the xbox version. To conclude instead of giving this game 1 hour of my time I gave it 5 minutes and clicked EXIT. I guess for 5 dollars you can't go wrong but still its a waste.",False

While the community is small its mostly a nice one; there's hardly any toxicity, at least with my experience meeting players.

Also, this game is cheap as hell (90% off during most major sales) and can run on a potato, so if you have a buck or two to spare, this game is definitely worth getting.

"First I will start out with the bad:
-It is very intensive to run. I can run almost every game I have on Ultra with my gtx1080, however, on Ark I struggle to run high with 60 fps.
-Official servers are a fuck-fest. You don't have much of a chance unless you join a decent tribe. Even then you have a high chance of losing everything. 
-The game is buggy at times, and official servers can be extremely laggy.
-They increased the price point. To me it's a 40 dollar game at the most. Although the devs have added A LOT since release.
-The game is a grind, and you can lose everything at anytime.
Now the Good:
-The grind isn't the worst, especially since taming dinos can help you grind more efficietly. (It's a survival game, you should be expecting at least a little bit of grind)
-You can ride dinosaurs.
-You can kill dinosaurs.
-You can kill people, while riding dinosaurs.
-There is so much shit to do even in single player or PVE. You can build amazing things, tame everything and fight bosses. Even exploring is fun in this game, although, once you have done it 100 times it isn't as enjoyable.
-If you play on an unofficial server the pvp is really fun. You have to find a good server, with good admins.
-There is a ton of mods that can really change the game.
Overall:
-Official CAN be fun, but it is mostly cancer. I recommend an unofficial PvP server with good admins. It is a great game, however, the current 60$ price is too high for it. If you can get it for 40$ or below, I highly recommend.",True

The games bugs are pretty bad, but the performance is another story.

Paid $65 for the 'Deluxe' Edition which doesn't really do anything.

"""Upper class white male railroaded around London dispensing hypocritical lectures about ethics and handing out drugs. With a side of disorganized gossip. ""

What I liked: 
- You are a wandering drug-dealer
- Roughly period-typical sexism and racism. It's a bit bizarre to say that you can get either right, but the commentary from both sides aligned with a lot of the garbage my own grandfather used to spew. Food for thought I guess. And it's occasionally nice not to see those issues watered down or dismissed.
- Nice environment design and atmosphere. Sure you're railroaded around areas, but the whole bombed out London matches my grandfather's old war stories (WWII) and his favorite documentaries. And you eventually unlock shortcuts everywhere to help with the lack of fast travel.

What I didn't like: 
- You play a upper class doctor who apparently experimented on his patients. Yet you condemn and punish those who do the same. It's pretentious and hypocritical, and several NPCs get to comment on it. No character development, you just get to be a git to everyone.
- While this a very heavy ""dialog"" based game, I managed to unlock AND pick almost every option in an order that was incoherent and painful. It's more like throwing golf balls at a dart board than holding a conversation
- Combat is irritating. Attack-dodge-dodge-repeat. Sure, you can use abilities but you are limited by two stamina bars (aka stamina and blood), and a flaky camera while all enemies aren't. Do NOT let yourself get backed into a corner. 
- Randomly appearing ""romance"". That wasn't a romance, or even an attempt at it. It was a hammer to the head and trite to boot.
- Very badly placed or just flat-out missing information regarding quests and lore that make no sense. How do you go from 
 garlic to insulin? Why is only one vampire affected by holy symbols? Why can you travel across water (on a boat no less), while another one cannot? Why is the steam card named ""ghoul"" when there are none in the game? [spoiler]Who thought it was a good idea to introduce ""Mary's Rose"" in the middle of that plot quest? [/spoiler]
- The entire [spoiler]goddess[/spoiler] bit came out of nowhere. Like, no clues or lore at ALL to precede it. Did the writers just get bored and give up or something?
- Randomly changing music. I'm in the middle of a district and the music would randomly change as though to anticipate a fight or some other interaction but NOPE. Nothing happens. No prompts, nothing to pick up, no enemies. 
- That never ending baby sound
- The swaying camera when running was nauseating 
- Sexism tropes much? [spoiler]Doris who is the literal trope of a woman going insane from her lost beauty (and thus livelihood) is immediately condemned and gets to burn alive screaming for her actions (no other options). Despite the fact that her plan failed? But Swansea, the real villain, can be sympathized with and given a merciful death or his greatest wish granted even though his sheer stupidity started everything in the first place? And let's not forget that if you manage a pacifist route you, less than a week-old baby vamp,  get to lecture a ~900 year old vampire about controlling the hunger?[/spoiler]

"Sanctus Reach has been and remains to be the best digital Tabletop Adaptation of Warhammer 40K at the point of writing this.

The ruleset is closed to the original, and even although it looks not too fancy, it features gut animations, solid voice acting, great campaigns and 4 races which are as close to the original ruleset as any adaptation managed to come so far.

Far any fans of the tabletop this is extremely great value. For anyone else, especially people into turn based combat this is still a very good choice.

the only downside is probably that the Sanctus Reach setting doesn't have more than the 4 races which are already in the game and that new races cannot be expected to be added at a later time. That's the most negative thing I can say about this though. Oh and maybe the fact that the camera angling sometimes is a bit messy.

"Very interesting premise. very good for a discounted price. i fully recommend this game, sadly there is some graphical bugs that will render the interface unuseable so you might happen to lose progress. i fully recommend for you to save often.

Pros;
-good realization and production,
-researching and learning feels rewarding, it all comes together and efforts are rewarded.
-i loved how some theories were actually traps.

cons:
- i have only played with isaac newton, but it felt too easy to snowball
- submitting your paper and writing it feels uninteresting, revising could have been better.
- feels like it need more minigames and mechanics for some parts
-the social part of the game felt like it was wasted, you have no incentives besides just focusing on studies.
-i dont like how it guides you, it should be more about exploration of knowledge and way less hand holding

in general its a good game, maybe with a better engine and a more interesting design it might go and become better. i loved this game, i want more things like this. recommend buying on sale though, not enough content to be more than a one time playthrough.",True

"This is a terrible choice and I do not recommend it.

The countering system is garbage.  At least half of your punches will travel through the other boxer and be counted as a miss.  If you manage to dodge a right hook, counter with a left hook, and then try for a right uppercut, you will miss every time.  

It takes waaaaay too long to actually knock anybody out.  The holding mini game is stupid.  Furthermore it gives a ridiculous amount of health back.  And there is no point in actually blocking.  You will literally block 0 punches.  The AI will always punch through your guard and hit you anyway.  Dodging and countering is the only way to avoid a hit, but given the glitches in the game that either push your boxer too far out of range to hit, or where you clearly do hit, but punch right through the other boxer mean you might score about 30-40% of counter punches.

There is no customization or creating your own boxer.  You have to use one of the 10 or so in the game.  There are some standard custom options, like changing the hair or the trunks.  But it is nothing like the good old fashioned Fight Night games where you could even be different weight classes.

Improving your boxer also takes infinitely too long when compared to the CPU boxers.  You will always be sub par compared to the CPU boxers.  I don't know about anyone else, but I am never interested in being an underdog, let alone a constant underdog.  While improving, know this... Stamina is the only one of the three traits that actually seems to matter or have any effect, since without it, you are only throwing 2 or 3 punch combos before being tired and worthless.

"Is it fun? Yes
Is it worth $60? Yes, there is a pretty massive amount of content present in the game at launch.
8/10

The main issue with this game is progression. This game wants players to do the side content it offers, and the side content that is in the game is worth doing. There is only one problem though, I don't want to be forced to do side content everytime I complete a story mission. The game almost forces it's side content on you, a good example of this is when you need to retrieve an artifact from the Labyrinth so you can seal away a first civ temple. The game makes you help some people out around Crete and all of the ""support missions"" in this sequence are meant for level 30ish characters. The actual fight with the Minotaur is a level 40 Mission. So you did a whole bunch of work for more or less nothing because you have to grind out quests on the other side of the map, it butchers the narrative progression of the minotaur story arc for no other reason then ""muh side content"". Either lock the first civ arc off until the late/end game or lower the levels of the beast fights.

Other then the progression issues this game is really good.",True

"Was totally excited for this game when it came out.  I had played table top games like Eclipse and although I love table tops very much, the setup time and waiting for everyone to take their turn can add up fast.  I was pleased to find out this game operates in real time.  No mess to clean up afterwards either!  The graphics are nice, the music is neat and the game runs incredibly smooth.

However, the problem started when after I conlized a few planets and took a ton of turns, I realized the game is very bland and empty.  There doesn't seem to be much to do, and the upgrade paths aren't really paths as much as they are things you have to get in a fashion you can't choose.   It doesn't feel the same way as other strategy games, where you can focus on upgrading certain paths for units and tech.  It's more like, ""Hey, these are the next three things you can research, and you can't research anything else until you do these"".

The game is also vast and has tons of planets and moons which you can collect resources from and sometimes colonize, but even colinization is quite lacking as it's upgrading tiles and building a ship port.  I was under the impression there was more to it.

Maybe this game will improve greatly in the next coming months, who knows?  I'd love to fall in love with this game the same way I did with table top space games.

"[i]This is a spoiler-free review of Life is Strange, I don't want to spoil the details for everyone (for the sake of the review).[/i]
Life is Strange is a story rich, choice based video game created by Dontnod Entertainment and published by Square Enix (publishers of Final Fantasy series). The game sets in Arcadia Bay, Oregon. The main protagonist is Maxine Caulfield or Max for short, a young student who wants to be a photographer at Blackwell College. I don't want to dig down details about the story, so it is the best to avoid it for the review. This game is running with Unreal Engine 3 Engine, the art style of this game is cel-shading with amazing watercolour details (I believe, so correct me if I am wrong). The gameplay has minimalistic feel, riddles to solve, linear level design, photographs to collect throughout gameplay, puzzles to put the piece together, dialogues choices and sequences to remember. The main feature for this game is rewind. The purposes of using a rewind is to pick different dialogue choices if you are not happy with the decision, obstacles to solve and paying attention to the details for the puzzle sequence. The choices you have made affect the story, characters, etc during your playthrough. The story has a mysterious, sinister feeling, characters are great and puzzles are welcome additional. This game made me cry literally, no joke. The moral of this game is related to Modern-day issues like bullying, social media and those sort of stuff. This game deserves a recognition, 100 percent. The controls are easy, there are not many buttons to press so no problem. But, the game has technical flaws, the lip syncing later episodes (around between 3 - 5) were poorly exectued and the audio keeps cutting out constantly during the dialogue. It ruins the experience of the game.

[h1]+ Pros[/h1]
[i]+ Mysterious, Sinister Plot with interesting moral[/i]
[i]+ Well executed moments[/i]
[i]+ Great cast with excellent character development[/i]
[i]+ Choices affect the playthrough[/i]
[i]+ Official Soundtracks[/i]

[h1]- Cons[/h1]
[i]- Poor Lip Sync later episodes[/i]
[i]- Audio cuts out constantly[/i]

For this game's review, it's such an amazing and dramatic experience for me, it made me cry and I learned from this game's moral (choices and friendship). I just cannot get enough from this game, I cannot wait for Season 2. The story, the characters, official soundtrack made this game the best narrative experience but lip syncing and cutting out audio during cutscenes or dialogue made my experience feel irritated. This game deserves a 9/10 with a solid recommendation. This is a must play video game.",True

"This game seems like it has a LOT of potential. I've played only a few hours, but I have to say that I'm really happy with how the game looks, feels and handles, and it is still in early access. I was looking at some of the reviews before I started mine and I noticed that some of the issues that people had mentioned were already addressed, which is impressive considering some are only a month or two old. 

The game movement is pretty good and the overall mechanics are very easy to get used to. You have transportation and locomotion movement to choose from which is more than some other games already released are doing. The story starts off somewhat cheesy, but it picks up and I feel like it delivers on a better stand alone story than even VFR did and I haven't had any of the technical issues I had with VFR either. The only issue I had were with the weapon holsters movinng with the headset and the dev already said they are working on fixing it.

"Ok.. Now this game has to be one of the best (if not the best), sandbox building games. It's great for just building cannons that fire melons into a giant fan, for posing people into retarded positions, even for making scenes and stuff. There's thousands of extra and FREE downloadable content things out here on the Steam Workshop, too. You can get things ranging from cars, to weapons, to more props, sexy girlfriends you don't have, and even playable pianos! But those are just a few. There's even shading mods for god sake. And that's just for singleplayer. The Multiplayer, however.. There are extensive amounts of Gamemodes out there, such as: Roleplaying, Murder, Trouble in Terrorist town, building competitions, PvP competitions, races, CINEMAS FOR GOD SAKE. And that's not even all.. If you want to dive further into the multiplayer, there's heaps of youtube videos from popular youtubers out there. Seananners is one I recommend, he's always doing gMod videos. Anyway, off topic This game is just insanity (in a good way, mind you). I'd highly recommend this game to anyone of any and all ages.

Now for my actual review:

At the moment of me writing this review, I'm only 9% into the game as it tells me. I've played a bit over an hour, and so far I love the game! The combat is really well done, the atmosphere is on-point, and it looks amazing, even on medium quality!!! Now one thing I'm going to nitpick about is the quicktime events. Now I'm not hating on them, I think they did a great job with them, its just that you have only like a second or so to react in certain cases. This causes you to die, and replay a usually boring cutscene (especially if you died 2-3 times) to try again. That is the only bad thing I have come across right now 78 minutes in. As a consumer I would totally recommend the game! The DLC on the other hand, I got the GOTY edition on sale which only cost 7 bucks, and I recommend doing the same: waiting until its on sale and then buying the GOTY edition. 

My verdict - BUY IT NAO!!!!


Oh yeah, also, Lara is freakin' hot AF",True
"The game is just fun as hell, pretty memorable hack n' slash adventure game, i for sure recommend.

Pros -  The art style is amazing and the designs are as good, story and world building are amazing, it never gets boring but the game is also somewhat long somehow, the gameplay is satisfying with amazing and fluid finishers that have some of the best transitions i have seen, has an FOV slider (very helpfull in third person games overall), environmental weapons like posts or trash cans, two of the abilities are very good visually and gameplay wise some might say one of them is broken, war's form is awesome looking, horse gameplay and ruin (war's horse) has some noice hair physics, the weapons (plural, yes) can also be augmented with weapon augments that are good and varied, they also change the look of the weapon depending on the augment, good and fun puzzles, its a semi open world game split into sections that are at the same time connected with each other, 

Cons - gameplay wise it's literally a zelda/god of war clone, fast travel is not fast at all, i love the idea and im glad it exists but the fast travel method takes to much time to not be anoying, two of the four abilities war gets are just MEH, usefull yes but kinda boring.

"As a kid I was (and still am) a huge fan of the Metroid series. The feeling of exploring memorable worlds and getting cool upgrades was simply unparalleled to any other gaming experience I had. Come late 2017, I had discovered Team Cherry's prize that is Hollow Knight. It blew away my expectations and quickly became one of my favorites of all time. After beating it I didn't think I'd be able to sink my teeth into another metroidvania quite like HK, or the Metroid series that I was so used to. I knew about Ori: and the Blind Forest, but something about the game pushed me to wait until just recently to play it. Looking back now I feel pretty stupid, but if you are like me and are wanting another metroidvania experience, or are a newcomer to metroidvanias, I would highly recommend to you this game. I could go on and on about how great it is, but I'm sure its been covered by other reviewers much more thoroughly.

"This game takes about 8-15 hours to complete depending on how you play and as you can see, I have a lot more than that in this game. Add another 2 playthroughs on PS3 and thats a more accurate number. This game is absolutely one of my favorites of all time. It is so much fun and I find myself coming back once every year or two to play it some more. Absolutely buy this and the other Max Payne games if you have a chance!",True
"It's a fun quick weekender.  You'll get what you expect, but don't expect it to have significant replayability.",True
"'Woah', I think, is the most accurate word to describe this game. I walked into it not expecting much but... woah.

In terms of gameplay it's a little boring at first, and the gameplay doesn't change a whole lot throughout the game. But the story is so good and it's so well written that the boringness goes away- in spite of nothing being changed (gameplay wise). That's how good it is.

It does simplicity really well and I haven't enjoyed a 'simple' game this much since Hotline Miami. The art. music, dialogue, and story are all amazing. 

Graphics- 4/10, pixel art is nothing new. This game can run on a potato. But that's not to say that the styleization isn't superb because it is. 

Music- 8/10. It can be distracting at times but it really makes the game's unique atmosphere that much more impactful.

Story- 10/10. Deals with philosophy, anthropology, and moral gray area better than I've ever seen in a video game before. Be prepared to meet a roster of interesting characters, who, no matter how insignificant their opinion or how stupid or how bias they might seem to their cause, each and every one of them has interesting and unexpected quirks and are sure to make you rethink your own principals. I can't remember how much I paid for this game but it was definitely worth it- whatever it was.",True
awesome,True
"This is a great game! There are some things i wished the wouldn't have changed, such as the art. I watched the gameplay of Corpse Party LONG before i got this game. The art was great!...This art is not for the most part. They changed most of the characters but some remained the same. I'm also really dissapointed the took out the still lifes! those added another level to the game in my opinion and i didn't at all understand why they got rid of it. OVER ALL the game is just as fun and tbh difficult as i expected! %100 worth the $15! Played this game twice and went back got every achievement and ending (yes it took alot of help from online because i'm super impatient but still), I'm going to play this over and over just like i did portal!",True
"Incredibly engrossing and addictive gameplay that kept giving me that ""one more go..."" feeling.

"All in all 9/10

Why 9/10 you might ask?

PROs:
*Awesome Graphics (no sarcasm)
*Great Gameplay
*Replayability
*RNG
*Atmosphere of the dungeon is good
*Will make you want to play more


CONs:
*Not alot of player customization (didnt really bother me that much)
*Mouse control sensitivty (Devs should be able to fix this soon enough)
*Some of the classes dont feel balanced making the others completely irrelevant


MIXED:
* Can be difficult and you can have bad luck (wouldnt recommend it to those who dont like dying alot on perma death games or feel pressured to look for food and rush to the next level to avoid minotaur)
* Best to have other players for good experience I believe, I dont have anyone else to play with so im Soloing.


CONs Explanation:

The only real thing that bothered me was the mouse sensitivity, which a simple patch/hotfix can fix. As for the classes I feel like the arcanist and rogue and a few others are very weak. There has to be a better combat system that would allow them to evade attacks or have some kind of counter to make them more viable, fun to play and balanced to the other classes in the game. As for the customization, maybe add more features to change the face and clothes possiblity?
 

PROs Explanation:

I love games like these, rogue-likes, its very simliar to ""Wazhack"", but with real time and first person point of view and other awesome elements. Love the RNG and possiblities when I was looking at this game. I was really skeptical because I was reading reviews of people complaining about the minotaur and boulder traps. The first two hours when I was playing this game, I was really into it- the dungeon is dark and it makes things hard to see and the boss talking in the background was just the finishing touch to it, I really felt like I was there (regardless of the graphics, I love them actually, nostalgia). I didnt die to boulder traps either in the first two hours I played but, Ive died to minotaur (because I was scared and thought I could fight him so I hid and that got me killed) a couple times thou. Furthest floor Ive gotten to at the moment is the 7th floor. The deeper I went I did die to boulder traps because I wasnt careful, they arent too hard to spot. As for the minotaur it kinda excites me just thinking about how I would have a minotaur on like the deepest floor and would be a epic race. 


MIXED:

As of now I heard that the multiplayer is a bit buggy and the mouse sensitivity is a definite thing but not major problem, but Im not really worried about that because im 100% confident the DEVs will fix this and even if the multiplayer isnt fixed right away the game itself on solo is how its ment to be played, for me atleast. Some of the classes I didnt find enjoyable, its not because it was too hard, early on in the game it just wasnt fun for me knowing I can only do about 10% damage to them per hit and if I get hit (which is like 95% chance you will in close combat) it will devastate me and do half of my HP or more depending on the class I am playing. Im sure the DEVs will balance this out or add a new mechanic to the game to make the other classes more viable with ""counter attacks"" or ""evade""



Conclusion:

I really like this game, its gotten me addicted and I will continue playing it until I finally beat it atleast once and will continue playing more by testing and experimenting new things. The originaly price itself is worth this game to be honest, Im surprised at how cheap it is. Im glad I bought it when it just came out and was 15% discount. 

Keep up The good work DEVs, You made an awesome game and Im loving it!

"This game's an instant classic, but if you're coming from modern shooters for the PC, the controls are gonna get you right off the bat. I mean, seriously? Moving the mouse up makes you go forward and doing it back makes you go backward? WHAAAAAT? I'm not bashing on the game or anything, it's fantastic, but the controls kinda ruin the gameplay for me.

For anyone reading this review, I have run into a major problem. I was going through doing an Aglophile (all British missions) run, and have gotten to the year 1534, completely annexed the isles, all of France, some of Iberia, and most of Denmark, but the game crashes as soon as I press play going out of save. This is entirely destructive to me, I have not gone through the restart yet to see if the game will work at an earlier date, but this is literally the first time this has happened in my 1,775 hours of game time. I have lowered the graphical requirements, shut down unnecessary things on my computer, but all to no avail. I will attempt a restart, but this has devestated my desire to play the game completely.

"Seen alot of negative reviews mostly from people who have played the game for under an hour and have unrealistic expectations of what early alpha is.
Also maybe it was supposed to originally be a DLC but at this point who cares in a world where we happily spend £20 or more on cosmetics in games.

Now before i start my review i feel i need to explain what early alpha is because i see it written alot but it appears most still don't fully understand what it means.

1. Early Alpha is early so don't expect it to be fully playable hence early alpha and not beta status durrr

2. Before games had early alpha they would and still do use game testing company's where people where paid to play through the game for a week this was to locate and log any bugs/glitches/crashes this is essentially your job now minus the getting paid part you just buy it at a discounted price.

2.5, This ties on from above your job is not to play this amazing complete and fully rendered game that's lag free it's essentially to test for bugs collect data and then give constructive feedback that's not ""Too much lag, loading screens long, delayed again...."" etc

3. Most games stay in early access for several years before the full release this is akin to paying to see behind the scenes footage of the next avengers movie then crying when you see a bunch of greenscreens because it's not the final production.

4. Too early access is not a thing there's no set point of early access that a game must adhere to although some seem to think there is.

I could go on but hopefully you get the point now i'm not saying this game does not have it's floors as all games do but at this point how do you identify a floor? 
Floors for EA games (pun intended) can be lootboxes, ignorant/shady devs, hidden fees etc anything performance or content related at this point is not relative because all this can be added overtime and usually is but i see alot of people want everything from the start which is not what early access is about see above for more if still unclear about EA^

My first impressions are there's alot of ark reskins which is fine because every game has a budget and why waste that budget when you can save money on reskinning old material on minor things such as turtle skins and rocks which could then be invested on other things that can be new have you never heard of recycling? geez.

So far so good no lootboxes or any hidden fee's and the devs can be trusted after their commitment to ark, which trusting a dev not to abandon their game appears to be a crucial thing these days i'm looking at you codehatch  -___- 

All in all there's plenty to be excited about with the future of atlas don't be a sheep and actually try the game yourself or if that's not your thing then just wait 6 months for the game to be in a more complete state and enjoy.",True

"I'm an avid rhythm game player (Sound Voltex 18's, DDR 18's, PoP'n Music 35's, Jubeat 9's, IIDX 7's) and this game offers a very unique experience.

While the price seems steep, it really isn't. I actually went and purchased a HTC Vive specifically to play this game.

If the developers follow through and do implement the custom song+chart editor, and help influence the spreading of the custom content (in a similar manner how Stepmania and Stepmania users keep that game alive), this game will absolutely make a killing. If they do not follow through on the editor, the logevitiy of this game will be very novel, and die in weeks.

"Incorporates many mechanics of city / colonizing sims that I enjoy while keeping other, tedious mechanics out of the game.

It starts simple enough and the tutorial is very helpful. It gets you into the groove of understanding resources and mass production, as well as population control.

It becomes challenging, but in a fun way. I have yet to get frustrated with the game. 

I thoroughly enjoy the FPS camera you can use to tour your city (nighttime looks especially awesome with all your buildings lit up). The graphics are good and not overburdening on a system with plenty of options to tone them down if need be.

"I am aware of the number of reviewes already published, but I believe I have played this game (as well as the other TES titles) enough to give my imput.
I would be brief and simply point out pros and cons rather than an emotional review about the past games and melancholic memories they recall.

PRO
- Immersive and non-repeatable gameplay: whether you choose to be a brave warrior, a sneaky assassin or a wise mage, there is no standard option or guide to obtain the perfect character! As in the other TES titles, you can really get yourself into a variety of classes (even though there is no actual standard class) that influence the gameplay and the advance of the story (it is fun how the NPCs around Skyrim wil lrecognise you not simply as a Dragonborn, but also in various ways depending on your quests)

- Lore: TES lore has always been the most fascinating thing in my opinion, and in Skyrim it will hugely affect your experience! You will find all the old lore as well as new local one.

- Different difficulties for different challenges: You can be new to the genre as well as a veteran, the different difficulties make Skyrim a game perfect for every kind of player!

- Great storyline: besides the Dragonborn quest line (which is already great despite some too ""obvious"" points), all the side quests and storylines create a fully interactive world with its problems and issues. I find the Civil War storyline the most interesting!

- Great DLC: despite many other games, DLCs are definitely worth having! Dawnguard adds an involving storyline to some new great and spectacular abilities, Dragonborn, with its brand new location, offers hours of wonderful gameplay, storyline, abilities and easter eggs, Hearthfire, even if can seem quite useless offers an interesting alterantive gameplay.

- Stunning graphic: being a title released in the 2011, we must admit it..even the most powerful PC still have little problems in dealing with the max graphic settings! The visual impact of the world is simply amazing, and the Workshop elements can only make your experience even better!

CON

- Perk system vs Old level up: I am a huge Morrowind fan, and when I firstly saw the perk I was quite disappointed. It doesn't allow the huge customize possibility as the old title did.

- Repetitive dialogues: as the game progresses you will find a number of standard dialogues being repeated over and over, the arrow in the knee joke will not be fun anymoe when every guard will repeat it.

- Easy enemies: as your abilities gets stronger, you will find that enemies will be easier to kill. Normally it would be a positive aspect (hey, I level up to be stronger, not weaker!), but when a Draugr is more challenging than a Dragon, than you may be quite disappointed.

Overall I would DEFINITELY recommend this game and if someone still has to purchase it...do it, before Jurgen WIndcaller himself Fus Ro Dah you!",True

 I didn't enjoy the music as much this time around but it was still pretty consistent and it's just my personal preference, this game was longer than the original which I liked as I just felt the original was way too short and this game took me around 7 hours to finish which is more than twice the amount in comparison to the first game.",True

"Very weird game. It is a spinoff of the series ""Creeper World""
A series that started as a flash game, and hence the first 3 are free online
The 2nd and 3rd however, have full standalone games with level editor and stuff

Now, would I suggest it? If you haven't played Creeper World, definitely not. Only to fans of that weird franchise.

Just do not get tricked by the steam store images, building ships happens only ""once"", as in, before the game really starts you make the builds. The campaign is short but good, enough to get all the main mechanics, and then you are onto level editor forever. Tbh, I don't think this has the replayability of Creeper World, not even the first one.

[b]Ultimately, I would suggest this ONLY to players who like Creeper World[/b], and atop of that want even more. Personally I like the franchise, but not enough, finishing the ""campaign"" of each game is enough to make me stop playing them. The case is similar here.
Honestly, buy it on 5$ if you plan to play just the campaign. If you are in doubt, try out Creeper World 3.

The things that are bad about Hard West are still more interesting to play with than any AAA game this year, so if you like turn-based tactics, it's a solid buy.

Kinda want a more fleshed-out and less linear sequel. Also: multiplayer. This would be a really fine multiplayer game.",True

"Game very much reminesent of Zelda.  I love the art style and the game play is very much old school feeling but with some modern charm.  I bought the game for my son and I when I heard about the multi-player but was a bit surprised when I realized it didn't work how I expected it is like old school (non-net) multilpayer.  To be honest I'm sure this made some people mad but instead my 10 year old son and I sat in my office and had a blast for 2 hours.  I think the style of the multiplayer goes well with the game.  

The game play loops seemed like it would get old, especially when we died very early on.  But we started to get the hang of it and make some progress and the loop makes more sense now.  I think it is definitely worth the price and will provide hours of fun with my son.",True

"A positive with misgivings - the game comes broadly in two halves.
The first is very much in the style of an open-world RPG, with loads of sidequests, locations to visit and dungeons.
The second half becomes an entirely linear dungeon crawler, taking away entirely the freedom that player becomes accustomed to in the first half.

The transition is jarring, and I suspect an indication that deadlines or funding forced a rapid completion of development. I understand the game went through a bit of development hell, so that might be it too.

The first half of the game, I enjoyed - the backstory and plot is less clear than I'd've liked, and there were a lot of questions that didn't even seem to be acknowledged by the game.

The second half, I really didn't.

The plot is a blend of new and old, recycling and reusing aspects from a lot of the previous FF games, while trying to remain fresh and unique. A lot of effort clearly went into trying to develop the characters relationships, with frequent bantering and interplay that you'll either enjoy or tire of quickly, even if the repetition isn't jarring for you.

In summary, I think the game could have been so much more than it was, but for the £18 price point I paid, I consider the experience is doed provide to be good value for money, so on that basis it rounds out as a positive.",True

"A much needed edition to the total war series, Warhammer and total war an amazing combo.  Being a total war fan there was a lot of stigma to making a fantasy total war since fans of the series were used to historical titles, but in my opinion besides Medieval 2 Total War this is my favorite.  It adds tons of gameplay changes while a lot of the older titles didn't experiment much.  Whether it was legendary lords, flying units, monsters, magic or others the battles felt a lot more chaotic and engaging.  Not to mention I had started to feel with recent titles that faction rosters were too much the same being copy pasta from one faction to another, in Total War Warhammer while fewer each faction feels drastically different and made me feel like I had to play through each of them.  Each faction also has their own set of legendary heroes that has quests you could complete to gain equipment for your character this could also be done through battles making your hero insanely powerful.  Besides the equipment that they can equip, the legendary lords you get can also level up buffing their stats further and allowing you to put points into a skill tree.

There are many other things I could say about Total War Warhammer, but I feel to me this covers why I would buy it, I would rate this game a 9/10.",True
"This game had a bumpy start for me because I just couldn't get into the atmosphere of the world that much. All of the segments were too short for me to grow to ~like them or feel a sense of belonging, or even wanting to save the world. Of course I felt sorry for the creatures(?) but not enough [spoiler] to make me hesitate during The Choice. Or rather, I thought long and hard about The Choice but in the end it came down to wanting to send Niko back home so they can see their mama again and eat their pancakes. Especially many of the characters stating that the world had gone to crap even before the Sun disappeared made it easier to give that world up and not trap Niko in it with a bunch of bizarro creatures.[/spoiler]  Obligatory Undertale comparison coming up, I guess the characters, while lovely and interesting, just weren't strong enough, or rather I couldn't spend enough time with them to really give me a hard time at the end.

In the same time it's exactly the game's short length that makes what they achieved with the worldbuilding and the atmosphere, the puzzles and the humour here so outstanding, because those were definitely my favourite parts of the game. I loved the tricks the game pulled, the amount of meta going on, the foreshadowing. It's definitely worth the full price. If it has a flaw it's simply that it's too short.",True

"QUICK SUMMARY  -  The game doesn't release enough content to regularly keep people interested, and when they do, you have to pay for it. Clunky gameplay and poor hit detection. Overly egregious microtransactions. Daily 25mb updates that do virtually nothing. Packed with cheaters. Skin gamblers' paradise. Plenty of better games to play than PUBG.

PUBG is the same game it was years ago in Early Access and is honestly not worth your time anymore. PUBG offers entirely too little to their standard players and there is no progression. Those who do not wish to participate in spending their real life cash on microtransactions should not play this game. There is no rewarding content a player can recieve that is earned through gameplay alone. All rare items have exceedingly low chances to drop out of crates, astronomically low, if you can even count them as rewarding... Down the road, Event Passes will continue to release about every 28 days. These will drown out the already egregious amount of 'lootboxing' that happens in PUBG. ""Pay money here to open this box. Pay money here for skins you can't otherwise earn. Pay money here to eventually go and play Fortnite."" Don't waste your time on PUBG.

FULL REVIEW  -  

I purchased this game a long time ago for 30$ when it was in early access and I currently have 486 hours played, I have not made a review up until this point. I used to enjoy this game even back in early access, when it's problems were forgiveable. In the beginning, it took only a small amount of forgiveness to get over the bugs and gameplay issues of PUBG. It's been years since that time and honestly, the game hasn't evolved into anything really that unique. Given how much money the game has already made and how much time the developers have had to improve the overall quality of the game and experience, the current state of the game is 'wanting to be like everything else', and I would argue its actually regressing instead of progressing.

First we'll go into gameplay. PUBG started out feeling like your character was a toaster, ice-skating around on laggy train tracks. What I mean by that is; moving felt grounded, slow, and clunky. Honestly, it still does. Shooting felt a bit like Counterstrike, depending on whether you play 1stP or 3rdP. It's gotten alittle better since launch but to be honest the hit detection in this game is garbage. That's not a friendly term to use, I know. But hit detection and overall coding revolving around this game's shooting is just unreliable, unconsistant, and unbearable. For instance, everybody has had that moment where they fired a shotgun point-blank into an enemy in PUBG, and their enemy survived and went on to kill them. On the flip side, the same player has been one-shotted from 30 feet away while wearing a t2 or t3 vest. There is no consistancy.

When the game first began its life, getting items through free random crates was the only way of getting new cosmetics. They were earned by battle points, they were free, it was good. Then they started to mimic Counterstrike and add in Keys and Locked Lootboxes. They claim the 'Crate and Key' system is something that everybody loves. No. No it is not! It just encourages foul play and cheating for people to earn ingame items and sell them in real life for cash! It's a poisonously toxic, disgusting business practice that seeps into a game's community and life. 'Crate and Key' loot systems turn games into wastelands with cheaters abundant, just look at CS:GO. It's a no brainer why there's so many cheaters in PUBG, Bluehole has to realize this but there is no way they're going to remove their precious money slot machines.

Then Bluehole released weapon skins. Okay, cool, more cosmetics locked behind crates. Being more of the same, this wasn't really a big deal or a surprise to me. But then... The Event Pass. This game has reached an all time low at this point. Where their competitors are beating them at their own game, even when Bluehole is sueing them and copying them all at once. What on Earth is going on here? I'm really struck by how a game with so much attention has done so little with their ambitions. It's just all monetisation from here on out. The game doesn't release enough content regularly to keep people interested, and when they do, you have to pay for it. There's no exciting gameplay innovations, nothing engaging the community except having your name on a leaderboard that gets refreshed. Wow.

This is the end of the line for me and PUBG, and honestly if you are wondering on whether to get into PUBG now, Don't Bother. There are plenty of other games that will better respect your time.",False

"this game is unplayable ob keyboard and mouse. That means what it says. 100% Unplayable. What ever conversion was done, was given up on before completion... Why these simple input conversions are never honestly completed, and the customer is intentionally never informed honestly, is one of Steams biggest Honesty problems. There Company could increase their reputation by at least 90%, just by going in and fixing the dozens of games, that they post as PC (KEYBOARD & MOUSE) PLAYABLE !!!! Come on Steam, quit this crap. 

As a Result, I give this game a (0 / 10) rating. That means Unplayable, and Not converted, while falsy advertised as so. This is why Steam has had every customer sign the AGREEMENT to not CLASS ACTION SUE the STEAM/VALVE INC. In reality, what they are doing with dishonest advertising, has mulcted thousands of customers out of hundreds of thousands of dollars... 

STEAM/VALVE... TAKE NOTE: This behavior is intentional and was premeditated on your part. That is why I will never purchase a VR / STEAM TV UNIT for VALVE. UNTIL VALVE Goes back, and fixes this massivly dishonest issue, I discourage all from purchasing those items, whether they work or not, Steam needs to learn two things:

#1. To Finish properly adapting Conversed games, before selling them.

#2. To Stop using professionally PAID SHILLS from SHILL PROVIDING COMPANIES, to Character Assasinate Steam Customers in every single situation where they try to report falty Games, that are being offered as 100% funtional.

Ultimatly GOOD OLD GAMERS is going to take over STEAM by DEFAULT, because they do not do this dishonest practice of selling broken games to unwary customers, and then asassinate their character, when these ripped off customers try to report problems on steam chat rooms...

Stema did not do this in the beginning, but it is now heir standard proceedure... It apear that steam has set a generic time limit for the programing to convert game, and if the coding takes longer, Steam simply has the programmers stop, and post the broken and incomplete game up for sale, as is, and simply lies to the customer about the state of the game... The CEO/Upper level suite that decided that was a good policy, is mentaly retarded at best...

Grow up Steam, you are ruining the reputation of entire Game Maker Companies with your under-handed dishonesty in marketing BROKEN-WARE.",False

"On the surface Terraria appears to be a simple 2d version of Minecraft, but im here to tell that this game is soooooooo much more than it appears to be!! The gameplay progression is unlike anything ive ever played and its VERY addicting to say the least!! From the humble beginnings doing just 1 dps with a copper sword,to finally getting to the ""wall of flesh"" and defeating it and thinking the game is over, only for it to spark a chain of in-game events altering the entire world,and everything about it(new items/weapons,biomes, bosses,dungeons ect.) thus discovering that after beating the final boss the game has actually only just begun. Bosses and biomes have dedicated loot pools so you know where to farm for that accessory/weapon youv'e been grinding for. Weapons and accessories are dropped with random stats and after you progress far enough you can re-roll the stats for a price so you can get that god roll youv'e been wanting, random in-game events keep things fresh with things like horde type events randomly spawning and attacking,most bosses are craftable with resources you find around the world so exploring is encouraged and farming bosses for the loots is too!! Just too many gameplay elements that they seriously nailed for any hardcore RPG player out there. Its ten bucks so id just buy it you wont regret it ;) also Kudos to the devs for making a fantastic game!!",True

I rate it Grind/10.,False
"Lets start by saying that this is a solid game, because it is. Would i recommend it? No. 

Lets go over the whats and whys. 

The inifial concept of the story struck me as something at least somewhat new and unique. Starting as a semi insane person is novelty in a way, if we forget Malkavians and the like. But it quickly slided down in terms of quality. The story is not entirely compelling and no matter what you do. You, ONCE AGAIN will never not in a million yeas get a good ending. Doesnt matter how good you are, doesnt matter how amazing was your decisionmaking or fighting. It just doesnt matter. The ending is set in stone,  you will die after 1 day of ruling, No matter what. Im fucking sick of every recent game in my memory doing that. It started with atrocious ending of ME3 and then it went on and on and on, - PC and NIiam dead in original Blackguards, tons of other games its like the new trademark: make endings spit you in the face. Fuck your efforts we want it to be remembered. And yes its understtandable from the story perspective and all but sersiously im sick of it.

Character creation and advancement. 

Stats were removed. And the system refined a bit, now you see what you pay for immediately. Its more user friendly, but i found that to me game lost a bit of charm with that decision, but dont get me wrong, i think its for the better. A lot of rebalancing, like the Witches Bile being nerfed aswell as some others, like the poison removal. No more wound persisting. Overall its way more user friendly. 

Story Discontinuity. 

This is a small problem which will probably be adressed in the near future -> there are some minor bugs with how story progresses, namely in the beginning you are teleported from dwarf mansion into a conversation with a mage already without a mask. That is done on a few occasions buts its very minor. 

Characters.

Well if you liked Naurim, his best buddy mage and Takashi or whats his face then i got great news for you! Unfortunately you will not have a designated ranged weapon specialist unless you will specialise into it. Oh! But let me tell you, you will want to  have a few spells up your sleeve! Thats right, you can progress anything any time! No more restrictions! On the other hand you WILL be forced to take Heal on your main guy for some fights. Otherwise you cant win them or will have to lower difficulty. Literally no other way. (unless you are willing to burn through consumables like crazy) 

Fights. 

Fights were great in the original game, they are even better here. Extremely challenging just by sheer ammount of bullshit some of them entail. How would you like to have 2 of your characters berzerking hitting everything that moves including friendlies, one envelopped in sand and immobile and last one trying to fidget with levers watching in terror as his teammates are torn to bits. Over and over and over and over. Or the neverending 2-4 mobs spawning every turn. Some fights are stupidly hard, some are ridiculously easy with double mage setup. Regardless the combat is way better then it was in the 1st game. 

Better camera controlls aswell, - all issues of the old game were adressed. Somehow though im not happy with this one. By all rational thought process this IS a better game in every aspect. But i somehow just dont feel it. The best way to describe it would be imagine there is a great local singer and he is putting his heart and soul into his songs, they arent flawless, but he touches you, you love it its great. Then he is picked up by some big studio, he is given tons of recources,  concerts, videoclips, support, backstage dancers - everything. But in his eyes you do not see the fire of old. The soul of what made him great is gone. To those who see him 1st time he is just another 'good new singer' but for you he is nothing like what he was of old. Yes he looks better and sings better but its not him. Dissapointed you switch channel with a sigh. 

This is how i feel about Blackguards 2. Its a good game, honestly. I d give it 7/10. But i would not recommend people to play it. Im sorry it just lacks the soul.",False

"[h1]If you don't like the aesthetic of the Jurrasic Park Park theme played badly on a Harmonica, this probably isn't for you.[/h1]

The short:
Mechanically in many ways this game is shallow, in many ways the way this game was followed and hyped was exactly like Spore, in many ways Sean Murray was exactly like Peter Molyneux. But if you want a space, sci-fi game whose heart is mystery and face is technicolor beauty; If you want a game to deliver you a meditative experience filled with ethereal electronic buzzing, and questioning, longing riffs then No Man's Sky is for you.

For anyone else who isn't absolutely excited to get out there and explore first person Spore, you are probably best holding off for now. 

[strike]The rest:
I've followed this game for years, checking back in more frequently as the release approached. I was hyped, but more importantly I was very inspired by the premise and aesthetic this game was attempting. Even with various disappointments No Man's Sky actually does deliver on the inspiration it lighted in me.

This game isn't close to being finished though, and it is expensive for someone who isn't absolutely into the Universe Hello Games have created. Strangely enough, where many of the mechanics tend to fall a bit flat the writing actually shines out above almost everything except the visuals and audio. 

Space trading is barely more than gambling on finding good deals amongst the meat terminals flying into and out of the space station. The best movement mechanic seems to be unintended: run, melee attack, then hit your jetpack to maintain your momentum (actually making your jetpack feel like one). Mining and resource collection that doesn't incite sentinels can be very hit and miss. Yet when you find yourself a mile under a mountain tokyo drifting through caves full of mushrooms and valuables it really hits the spot. The most mechanically disappointing thing is actually that ships do not have specific types (maybe in the future) and all 'slots' are made equal. So you can never quite tell if you'll actually want a ship just by looking at it, or if you like the visuals hunting down a version that has the number of slots you want.

The strangest thing I must admit, is that of all games that could have seriously used Early Access, this is one of the few that would have shined so bright, and benefitted so much from the extra user input and dev time it could have offered. The team also seems responsible enough to have worked with it responsibly. But that is a different discussion.[/strike]

Beyond Update: It's been a really inspiring turnaround to see the general content of the game be overhauled as it has been. For those who wish to play 'Normal Mode' there is barely a concern to bother with the inventory management, for absolute madmen they added 'PermaDeath'. The underwater content is significantly more fleshed out and interesting, base building is effectively unlimited, and now has more depth than ever. Owning and managing a  frigate fleet is an entire game unto itself. 32 players and a hub that lets you skip the previously tedious search for certain Quality-of-Life upgrades? Why not.

The LongShort: I mostly play for Photo Mode. I find it very rewarding to stumble onto the perfect scene that just happened to spring into existence. This has always been a ""make your own fun"", open-ended experience that one feels comes to an end whenever one decides.",True

"Arma 3 Is a very fun game with many things to play in it, from campaign single player to massive multiplayer games such as Battle Royale and King of the Hill. After playing almost 400 hours I would say this game is worth it if you have a good enough computer to run it. Single player is easy to run, but when you get into multiplayer servers the game becomes a lot harder to run. On a low populated King of the Hill, with typically around 25 players I get 45-50 FPS, but on the more populated servers around 80-100 players I get 25-30 FPS. The game is very CPU intensive but fun as hell. I would say to wait for it to go on sale because it can go down to as cheap as $15 on sale.

"I was very excited about this game when I first heard about it. The reviews are simply gushing over this game... I wish I had downloaded whatever game those players got. The one I played was a beautiful game, But after 2 hours of play I had no idea what I was supposed to do as the devs didn't think it necessary to educate the player on anything... Character creation... here are some vague references to terms you have no earthly way of knowing at this point... Quests... Here, we'll mark the location on your map where you will die because you have no gear to help keep you alive! My first attempt to play I completed all the quests I could find, all remaining quest lines were leading in the same direction (leaving the starting area) so I go. After dying to every fight in that area I realized I was under powered, so I return to the starting area to look for any quests I missed... And previously neutral mobs are now all agro. I had to go back to a previous save, wasting 2 hours of playtime.

The thing that pains me the most about this game is that I really want to like it. The story sounds cool, The subtle touches here and there that brings the world around you to life... but it is ruined for me by the lack of choice. Your game can be ruined by just walking into the wrong area, you need to find every secret, every quest, every Item to sell so that you can get the equipment/skills/levels you need. I have played a lot of games that are challenging, but there is no ""improvement"" here there is a finite number of resources (XP, Items to sell) and if you miss anything you are done.  It's as if the Devs expect the player to be as familiar with the game as they are.

I even broke down and looked up videos on Youtube... half of them are just as confusing as the game itself, the other half uses techniques that have been patched out of the game.",False
"If you're looking for a game that will keep you on the edge of your seat, whether its for story, guns, or playing with friends, this game has it all.",True
"The game community is insanely toxic. The game has a huge learning curve. But for beginner's this game can be a nightmare. The game has one of the worst matchmaking issues. A beginner might have to face pro player in casuals or in ranked. I wish this game comes up with a good matchmaking service instead of insane amount of operators for 3 minutes showdown. Also if  ""noobs"" like me are gonna be verbally abused every match, atleast bring in a story mode gameplay so that the beautiful and amazing graphics can be enjoyed afterall.",False

"I love Homeworld. Brilliant game. But, HW2 just pisses me off! Especially missions 11 and 12. Fortunately, there's enough enjoyable gameplay in HW1 that I consider it a good purchase anyway. I played the original games over 10 years ago and HW2 pissed me off back then too. I'll just have to look up a walkthrough. Crappy game design. Wonder if the sequel was outsourced because I hate it.",True

"*EDITED*

Apparently they fixed the ""bug"" that required online only and the ""bug"" that prevented the steam store page from displaying that this game contains agressive 3rd party DRM and have toned down the worst parts of it.

I will change my review to positive like I said but that only extends to the game and not to sega itself. Whoever at the company that made these bone-headed descisions needs to re-evaluate thier procedures and customer base.

*OLD REVIEW*

Good on sega for deciding to release a retro sequel in this game climate. 

Shame on sega for sneaking ""always online single player"" DRM in after the period where preorders cannot be refunded. I get intermittent drops in service where I live which will make this game a crap shoot. and this type of dishonesty kills what remaining credit they had with me.

If they pull thier head out of the sand and remove the online requirement I will change my review to positive because the game is not bad.",True

Saw my buddy playing this game years ago and it looked so interesting... I think I only paid 16 dollars or so for this bomb diggity. I've seen it come a long way and the developers definitely care and update it. It still has a lot of bugs but thats being addressed. It's so simple yet so well done. Plenty of room for improvements but it still isn't done yet. Turn your speakers up and damn you may piss in your pants. Playing solo is fun but if you got a cool buddy like my main man Shayne-O playing coop is deadly. Working together to build up a crazy base and dominate is real fun. Buy it now sucka.,True
"Possibly the best mystery game I have ever played.

Gripping story with interesting and diverse characters supported by the absorbing atmosphere and underscored by the great soundtrack.

As a caution: Do not be discouraged if you you are stuck on a puzzle for which you feel you have all the necessary hints. There are two or three instances where you will need additional hints you will find later on. All puzzles are perfectly reasonable if you give them some time.

Approximately 5-10 hours of gameplay",True
This game is great and it has potential. i highly recommend this game if you like a challenging open world/survival games,True
it's epic poggers,True
"PUBG is a game that is a bit challenging for weaker computers, but when you turn the Death cam off, it's fine. To rate ... The game is overall very well graphically processed. The animations and sounds of the weapons are quite realistic. It's definitely not the best Battle Royale game, but like any original, it has its own charm.

"Far Cry 3 is the best shooter for my opinion.
I still consider this game the best in the Far Cry series.

10/10 - For Vaas.
10/10 - For the cutsceenes.

Now I will explain why its not 10/10.
Its becouse the game is just too sort for me.
But Im still a big fan of this game and I absolutly love it.

Hope you liked my rewiew and please dont forget to like it becouse its free god damn it ! ;3",True

"Dead Cells is a very good game with fluid combat, beautiful art direction, and an excellent OST. The game definitely poses a challenge, and you'll get your ass kicked throughout its entirety.

The new and innovative level/skill system gives you the chance to combine anything you want whether you want to be a Battle-Mage in heavy armor or a sneaking Thief with heavily enchanted weapons and powerful potions, the choice is yours.
Definately a must-buy if you enjoy a good RPG game.",True

I like this games graphics but I think the campaign could be a little more than just playing a normal match. Possibly  if it had a story it could be better and there are a lot of controls but its still a great game.,True
"A game I played a bit as a kid, but I must have been braindead back then because I couldn'y even get to the first village back then.
My pros:
+Story and character interactions are enjoyable, not the best, but at least entertaining
+Colorful world
+graphics of the gameplay itself it somewhat cleaned up (doesn't hold a candle to anything remotely modern, but this doesn't bother me)
+soundtrack is very nice
+""ultimate"" weapons fairly easy to get

My cons:
-SIDE QUESTS! More specifically the amount of backtracking you gotta do. Like, even after you unlock the teleport network, there's still a ton of running back and forth.
-Final boss fight forces you to use a single predetermined character, which was super annoying after I spent the rest of the game building up my other party members just for them to be forcibly benched.
-Pre-rendered cutscenes, unlike the gameplay graphics, were not cleaned up and look absolutely horrid.
-One more thing to add about the last boss, the ""difficulty"" scale is a bit of a jump. Dude hits like a semi-truck made of darkmatter. Luckily it can be mitigated, but I had like 2 spots in the fight it got sketchy for me, even with about 3.7k HP 
-""ultimate"" weapons are kinda underwhelming

Neither here nor there:
~voice acting is kinda iffy at best, not really impactful, but it is definitely noticeable, especially at the start of the game while you're still getting used to it
~no track for the final boss, just kinda fighting in mostly silence with the exception of the voice lines whenever player character or boss uses skills

All in all, I'd definitely recommend it, it's super cheap whether it's on sale or not. It's also relatively short (I write this right after finishing the game, having done most of the side quests, getting all ultimate weapons, etc).  I feel I can safely say that this review is done without nostalgia goggles on; while I did play it as a kid, I didn't really do much, and 99% of my experience is completely fresh.",True
"This game is great but it's really hard. And unlike Isaac and Risk of Rain and other Rogue Likes, this game doesn't get easier as you gain more items. You will never achieve OP god status in Gungeon. So expect an everlasting challenge.",True
"I've really enjoyed all of the Risen games so far. Lots of freedom, very little hand-holding, lots of toys, interesting characters and locations. On the down side this is the easiest in the series so far. The strong challenge and lack of world-levelling - where the enemies get more powerful as you progress - was my favorite thing about the earlier games. It makes things VERY satisfying when you get that new spell or item and finally crack a previously almost invincible enemy. 

I blame those negative reviewers who haven't really understood the earlier Risen games for the dramatic drop in difficulty here..

It's very much a marmite game - you will love it or hate it.",True
"The Antikythera mechanism comes with more documentation. The interface matches the visuals - something straight out of 1985. The game tries to model political policies, but the understanding of Libertarianism is on par with that of a 15 year old Somalian. The information provided by the community, what few of them there are, is almost entirely outdated. YouTube ""guides"" seem to be for an entirely other game, the systems are so different.

Steer clear unless your idea of fun is trying to puzzle out the interface and what the game is actually doing.",False
"    Could not get this game to run better than 15fps on multiplayer, somtimes it would dip to 10fps, never tried single player. Guess its a known issue with amd cpu's. My card is a geforce 970, and my system is more than enough for this game. Ive tried the many fixes recommended for it from the many people with issues to no avail. Steam won't refund me because I went over the 2 hour return policy (just trying to troubleshoot it). Less then happy.  My friend with the same video card but a intel cpu gets 30-40fps.

"What a good business decision... Mess up the official servers and since you can't host a local one or a dedicated server on your own, you can ""rent"" a server through Nitrado.

This game should have come with the ability to host a local server so people could at least test the game even if the official servers were busted. Considering it just looks like a ARK MOD, It would have taken a lot of effort to remove the ARK multiplayer options. I wonder if this has anything to do with my first point?...",False

"Honestly one of my most favorite games out of all the ones I own. If you like Empire/Napoleon total war esque battles then it's great. Simple and fun. I also recommend the previous game, Ultimate General: Gettysburg, because it provides a more in depth look into the battle and has no scaling. There are also many more ways the battle can turn out. Also it has multiplayer, which Civil War unfortunately does not have.",True
"No no no no don't touch this awful awful awful AWFUL attempt to HD-ify a classic. It's terrible. Runs awful, it's barely improved, and it uh, runs awful, and, it runs awful, and, it runs awful. WHY DOES IT RUN AWFUL?! Seriously, it is the worst attempt to port an old game I have seen in my life.

No. Don't play this. Even if you're an AoE fan, you're better off playing AoE: Online (It hurts me to say that, AoE:O is putrid), just deal with the memories and don't try to revisit the past with this absolutely abysmal attempt to bring and old game back to the table.",False

"This game saved my life.

I am 25.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you",True
"Game is hard but not that hard as the original Half-Life and not that easy as the Blue Shift.
The story is good and the length of the game is around 4-6 hours to finish.
Multiplayer is same from The original Half-Life but has added new weapons or refurbished.
Definitely worth playing and paying as the story is better than Blue Shift.",True
It's awesome! Like the real time but pausable strategy and the different ships and races.,True
"This game is everything you would want in a DBZ game: 3D axial battle control, great story idea as well as customizable characters. it is not without some fault tho. Like the controls are a lot of get your head round, even for a veteran DBZ player. Also, the diffuculty of the game goes from 0 to 100 very quickly but its still a fun ride. Nonetheless, great battles, great graphics and great online quests......A must have for DBZ (and all around anime) fans.

Sure team killers are WAY to common but after like 2 team kills they are kicked or banned. But I also hate how much the game bugs out. Sometime people wouldn't have a hitbox other times they would fall through the map. Or they would crash. Soooo to Ubisoft all I have to say is fix the net code and then the game ""may be playable"". But as it stands now you need a VERY good PC and a even better Internet. So I recommend this game for anyone that has a good PC but if you don't just wait till the net code gets any better.

"So I have played a fair amount of time playing this game. This review (like every other review these days) is for gta online. Gta single player is still a phenomenal game and absolutely worth buying. Now for online. The online is borderline unplayable. Almost every third player you come across is using a mod menu, and they're either going to use that menu to spawn money on people or use it to ruin the game for everyone else. I could not even count the amount of times I or one of my friends had a delivery mission ruined by some idiot in god-mode using OP weapons or vehicles they spawned in. You can't defend yourself in any way, all you can do is report and leave. One friend of mine ended up installing a mod menu himself just so he can defend us from other players who were cheating. The only defense is to be in god mode yourself. He ended up getting suspended and had his progress wiped (he mistakenly spawned a large sum of money, he was banned for fair reasons). While the punishment for cheating is just, it is way too common to find cheating players and way too easy to obtain mod menus. Do not buy this game for online, do not play online, and for the love of all that is holy do not buy a damn shark-card, (microtransactions that spawn you money without the banhammer). Play single player and spare yourself the misery of online.",False

"[h1] Introduction [/h1]

When it comes to hardcore open world RPGs, Outward truly stands out. The land of Aurai is an unforgiving place scattered with ruins, forts, caves and catacombs full of giant bugs, crackhead bandits and eldritch horrors that want nothing more than to pound your corpse into a fine paste. At first the difficulty is unforgiving, but with failure and death comes knowledge. Running out of health and stamina all the time? Learn alchemy or cooking. Enemy too strong? Learn how to bait them with traps or get a co-op buddy. Every challenge in the game has a workaround, making a truly unique experience for each player. However, understanding the ever changing environments, enemies and challenges is just one step to mastering Outward, the real challenge is getting lucky. (I'll touch on that later)

[h1] Combat [/h1]

With the clinking of swords and popping of spells, combat is where Outward excels. Combat is similar to Dark Souls, lock-on based melee fighting with a combat roll. Just remember, your characters flesh is made of just that, any hit you take will hurt... a lot. Health potions are not covered by your health insurance for the first half of the game, early game healing is provided by any type of cooked meat, you'll be waiting about 3 minutes for 50 health to regenerate after downing an entire steak. So pay attention to attack patterns and time your swings an dodges accurately. Magic on the other hand is a completely different beast that will take time and effort to learn. Each character starts off as a machete wielding maniac that  probably doesn't even know the word ""magic"". Outward takes on a ritualistic style of magic, obtaining a mana pool of your own is an adventure by itself, leaning spells by purchasing skills from trainers, (as you do with all skills types) is only part of spellcasting, in order to effectively use spells they must be combined with other compatible spells or materials picked from dungeons. For example; want to cast a simple fireball? There's no spell for that, try combining a Sigil of Fire + Spark. Just got done killing a group of bandits and have no mana left? Reveal Soul + Spark, exchange the soul of a fallen bandit to restore 50% of your max mana. There's also runes too, but I'd go far over the character limit explaining those. All and all the combat experience is a treat, the only downfall is breakthrough points. Each character is given 3 breakthrough points, these points are used to specialize in skills allowing the player to become a master, learning higher tier abilities in said skills. The issue is you only get 3, so no, you may not turn into an unstoppable killing machine like the Dragonborne. This is a good thing to an extent as it promotes multiple characters in a very replayable game and limits the power the player has.

[h1] Story [/h1]

When it comes to story telling, the main questline story is enough to brush over and not pay much mind to. The story branches off into four different faction questlines that have four missions each. [spoiler] that all end with the same quest [/spoiler] Similar to Gothic or Ultima, you start off as a no one, shipwrecked off the coast of your home city, you've inherited a debt from your ancestors called a blood price. It's up to you to pay it back. Of course, the three kingdoms can't decide if its fair to have a ""blood price"" system and they all of their own ways of dealing with it, the player gets to choose which kingdom to support in order to pay off the dept. On top of that you got a pissed off otherworldly force known as the Scourge wanting to sap all life. To show just how bad the story is, I have completed the game and still had to google what exactly was going on, needless to say the story line is not the main focus. The quests are still very interesting as most of them are timed and have consequences to messing them up, so they can't really be delayed like quests in other RPGs.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

In conclusion Outward is a deep and challenging adventure filled to the brim with excitement and hours upon hours of fun. So why the thumbs down? One word; bugs. Not the angry ones that try to kill you, I'm talking about glitches. As of now, I have put in 24 hours into the game, painstakingly looting and farming enemies and dungeons, I was in a fort fighting a bandit wizard when I accidentally slipped up and died from a spell, triggering a death scenario, as usual, I escaped and grabbed my stuff, but my bag full of loot was nowhere to be found. Until I remembered I dropped it before getting into the fight so I can be more mobile. I re-entered the fort and retrieved it, something was off though, my bag didn't weigh anything......cause I lost 24 hours worth of loot and silver leaving me at the endgame with nothing but the equipment I had on. Just to make this completely clear, I lost 5200~ silver and all my legendary gear because the game thought it'd be so ""haha"" funny to despawn all my loot, I'm lucky to be left with the equipment I have. But I just cannot recommend a buggy game they requires the player to pray to whatever god they believe in that their character doesn't get fucked over by the game for absolutely no reason.",False

"Terraria is truly one of my favourite games and honestly I'm continually surprised by how much I enjoy this game. It's absolutely massive with thousands of different ways to play the game as well as enemies, loot and events. 

Game play 8/10:

The game play is exceptionally fluid, the combat is intuitive and smooth. I really have to take time to mention that the combat is fast-paced and flexible. You can complete the game in multiple ways that are entirely independent of each other, be is summoner, warrior, ranger, mage or any variant of each. I find that each time I play the game I attempt to make it just a little harder for myself, either by playing something completely new or simply trying a new tactic or handicap to spice things up a little. Not like it's really necessary as expert mode in itself will give you a swift boot up the arse if you aren't giving it the respect it deserves. The combat is hectic and really enjoyable when you're in the thick of it, testing both your mechanical skills and reaction times, especially the upper echelons of the game can prove incredibly challenging. I will admit as a point of legitimate criticism that the game is vast, and with that vastness comes complication that is really unavoidable until you have a good grasp of what you are doing. Seasoned vets will never really be able to experience the sheer confusion when a new player zones into the game, and that admittedly the game could do with an optional tutorial as to how stuff works. I feel there might be a tonne of players who are turned off at the idea of learning how everything works on their own without the use of an immediate guide. I myself as an experiences player careering over 450 hours still have the wiki up on my other screen at all times for recipes and drop rates. 

Graphics: 9/10

Honestly the game is gorgeous and simple. A perfect example of how sometimes simplicity can give such amazing results. Much like Minecraft, Terraria is displayed in a square-block fashion. The game itself is only ever shown in a 2D style, and this lends itself to an interesting cross-section view of the world. The illusion of 3D is brought in through the use of back walls which can be placed to create the image of a 3D world with only 2 of the dimensions. Take a moment to go and google ""Terraria big builds"" and just sit looking in awe at the wonders you can create with only 2D blocks. If you are a connoisseur of anything artistic in your sandbox worlds, this game will provide you with not tens, but hundreds of different materials to help you create anything you want. I honestly believe this game took what made Minecraft's style fresh in the market for it's time, and then took it a step further. 

Difficulty 7/10:

Terraria boasts an impressive boss count at 28 (including optional bosses). The bosses are all unique and challenging in their own ways. To many experienced players, even the later fights in the game still pose a legitimate threat. As mentioned before, there is also an expert mode, which further adds new mechanics and an upgraded health and damage boost to all of the creatures you'll encounter. I find that the difficulty has this very smooth curve upwards and nothing feels like it hits you completely out of the blue. If you are struggling with one thing, take a moment to go and see what else you could do to improve your character. There's nothing stopping a completely fresh character from taking down bosses, but the game is very accommodating for everyone. If you don't need the absolute best gear to kill something, you aren't mandatory forced to get it.  Equipment and weaponry are all plentiful in the game, the numbers of which, I wouldn't even want to go and count. There are legitimately hundreds of ways to beat the game, and if you find that it's too easy, you can just crank it up a notch. Nothing stops the player from using worse gear/weaponry/potions/arenas etc. 

Overall 8/10. My general thoughts and criticisms:

Terraria will always be a game I go back to when I feel that itch, and i'll always drag along a friend or two to join me. One of my immediate concerns with the game as I stated earlier is the need for an optional tutorial. As a gift I bought a few of my friends the game, some of which did seem like lost ducklings when they played because the game is actually very confusing. It's not always immediately obvious what you need to be doing. If you can put 4 hours playing solo into the game when you first buy it, I guarantee the game will seem a lot more intuitive and suddenly it will all make a lot more sense. Also as I mentioned before, another valid concern is the need for information about items/events/bosses/general info that you don't always have, and thus pull up the wiki for. The game is indeed very complicated, and when playing with new friends I often get the question ""alright, what do we do now?"". Although there is no lack of content, the information that you do need in order to play the game is very high. My 3 most looked at pages in these last few weeks is potions, armour and weaponry on the Terraria wiki. Perhaps an alternative might be just adding a few lines of dialogue options for the guide that could suggest what the next course of action is, such as ""I've noticed an old man by the dungeon, he seems suspicious. Said something about nightfall."" A clue like that might just be enough to keep newer players on the path rather than having them scratching their heads clueless at what to do now. Overall in my opinion, the game is excellent, with masses of replay-ability and generally just a super fun experience for you on your own or with a group of friends. I honestly would recommend this game to anyone, and if people do have any questions regarding it, I am more than happy to answer them when I am available.",True

"I have really enjoyed playing this game, but you should not buy it. Paradox has a terrible DLC policy that is designed to get you to pay them a ton of money. Look at the content with Mandate of Heaven: almost exclusively China and Japan, but also a new system (Ages) that is fully in the game, but not activated.

If you look at other games, you'll see more of the pattern. In Stellaris, Utopia and Synthetic Dawn split the Gestalt Consiousness mechanic between them; if you want the organic version, you need Utopia, the Robotic, you need SD. In CK2, you need a different DLC to play each of Pagan, Muslim, Indian, and Chinese religions, and another for Nomadic hordes; you also need two different DLC to unlock the two earlier start times. In Hearts of Iron 4, you need a DLC to reasonably play as the Indian Raj or any other state that starts under the English crown (I tried before the DLC came out, and was rather upset; never did buy that DLC, as I think that at least declaring independance should be in the base game).",False

"The very best 3D fighting game experience this decade has to provide. Amongst all fighting games across all platforms, 2D or 3D alike, there is no game that can bring you the joy and excitement Xenoverse 2 could. 

Xenoverse 2, as a predecessor of Xenoverse, is a direct upgrade in both graphic and mechanics, while carrying on the original trait and style, featuring better gaming experience and a smoother semi open world. Xenoverse 2 also comes with interesting side quests(parallel quests) for you to explore, alongside with a story mode coincides with the Dragon ball original manga. You can relive the epic story of the anime with either a cast character or your custom created character, while collecting all the skills and cosmetic items that are shown in the entire manga(even DB GT).

No matter you are a Dragon ball fan or not, this game brings you a very unique if not a very niche fighting experience. It is a fighting game by core, but it also offers Dragon ball world’s unique ki blast abilities, which makes it almost feel like a TPS shooter, but the smooth fighting experience and seamless combos with all its melee and ki attacks and both the super and ultimate variants, you will be constantly staying in action and fighting off waves and waves of classic enemies with your new found skills. 

If you are a Dragon ball fan, then this game is a must have. Not only can you immerse yourself into the perfectly animated 3D Dragon ball world’s famous locations which are taken directly from the manga, you get to learn all the skills you dream to have, and fight alongside the Z fighters to save the history. On top of that, you can also fight against all the classic villains and heroes throughout the Dragon ball history, using the cast characters, or your own character cosplaying as a cast character. Xenoverse 2 does a great job making you feel what being a fighter in the Dragon ball world really feels like.

Overall, with the near ending of DB Super, Xenoverse 2 also comes close to its life span. However, with all 7 dlcs and an 8th to come, the game has not only kept up with the on going manga, also created some unique game world experience like raids, expert missions and Hero Colloseum, definitely worth sinking some time into and make yourself better over time. Unfortunately no games are perfect, Xenoverse 2 suffers a lot from its terrible AI and net code, which undermines a would be perfect multiplayer experience, but with all the premises this title has shown, there are definitely a lot more to hope for in Xenoverse 3 in the near future.

I should not have to point out the obvious reasons to buy this game, but I will say that the character models are improved, as is the combat system. Flash combos are level based and the new growth crystals means less level grinding, always a plus. The new burst gauge function is pretty neat, and it seems to be the only way to fully strip the opponent, don't worry about activating the attack, that happens automatically if you have burst mode active on the final hit. But even if you strip them they don't stay that way in cutscenes... which does not bode well for future games in the franchise.

"With the final game in the dark souls trilogy, does this game end with a bang or a whimper?  Neither, it ends with a massive middle finger to players of this beloved franchise.

As a player for the last two Dark Souls, I was curious as to how this series would end and ready to get into the challenging difficulty that we all know and love.  Unfortunately, Dark Souls 3 (DS3), is a mess of poor game-play mechanics and a story that lacked the intrigued or urgency of the past games.

Story:
Players take the roll of the Ashen One during the end of days as the fire has burned out and the kings who were meant to keep the fire going have abandoned their post.  Now it is up to you to bring them back and determine the fate of the world.  My problem with this story is it boils down to a fetch-quest.  Essentially, all your employees called off sick or ""Ferris Bueller'ed"" the day off and you need to go get them.  While, the game still keeps its vague story telling I never took the time to read any of the item descriptions because the story was never engaging.  This is made even worst with a world design, (that while beautiful and haunting at the same time), was devoid of any life or anything exciting to keep me going.  I did not feel inspired to go on as the stakes or urgency is poorly established, that the carrot does not match the stick.

Game-play:
The game-play is hands down the biggest problem with this game and can be summed up in two words ""unplayable"" and ""unbalanced"".  The issue with the game-play is that there are two dichotomous styles that are completing with each other that make the experience a mess.  On one side of the coin, the game is faster with enemies being more aggressive, attacking in groups, and being frenetic.  On the other, the traditional Dark Souls experience of taking your time, watching the stamina bar and timing your attacks.    

The problem this creates is poor balancing, were enemies can attack with impunity but you as the player are still confined to outdated mechanics that do not implement well with this new system.  If the game is designed to be faster and reflex orientated then the player needs to be part of the equation.  It's like playing resident evil 4, where enemies can run around and do what they do best, but you are confined to tank-controls.  IT DOES NOT WORK.

Final Thoughts:
I was really hoping that this game would be a memorable experience, but sadly, I am massively disappointed.  Bad game-play design and a story so devoid of life and interest, that I cannot recommend this game to anyone.",False

"I don't understand how someone can like this game, except playing in god mode. World building and art direction very good and story also pretty ok, but when it comes to gameplay there are only words like annoying, boring, clunky and infuriating that come to mind. Everything, walking, shooting, sneaking and even pathfinding feels wrong.

Walking: Sometimes you can run fast, sometimes you can't, sometimes you can walk over obstacles sometimes not and so on, you can get stuck or worse at some environmental stuff if you miss the path by a hair

Shooting: headshots don't register half the time, laser upgrade on weapons is less useful than just using the normal crosshair, through some holes you can shoot while not being able to shoot through another that looks exactly the same, enemies are extreme bullet sponges even on normal difficulty and don't really show any sign of taking damage until they die and together with critical headshots not being reliable you're asking yourself the whole time: ""How long until this next guy finally keel over?"", instead of ""Ok, now it take 2 shots and I can move on.""

Sneaking: in some sections the game does not let you play sneaky if you don't go a very specific path, they will always notice you if you don't use that specific path whatever you do, throwing knives are very inaccurate, stealth kill sometimes does not register even if you come from behind, enemies can sometimes not see you when you're right beside them while in other situations being able to sense you even though you're nowhere near them

Pathfinding: environments are very confusing, you have a compass but until now none of the ppl i have talked with have ever said anything about a clear direction so it's useless, the drections or what the game thinks are directions you get from other characters are extremely imprecise and can confuse you more than they help you, so you end up just searching every corner for a way forward without knowing if you're actually moving away from your goal or towards it",False

"I had a lot of fun, but the game is about twice as long as it should be. They stretched 25 hours of gameplay across 50 hours, and several times I considered quitting before finishing the main storyline. I'd have to take 1-2 weeks off before coming back. It also doesn't help that the last chunk of the game is incredibly difficult: many one-shot kills by enemies, not enough good gear drops, really short respawn timers, broken scripts (when coordinating with NPCs, they would often get far ahead of me and break the zone), and excessive spawns in small areas. Be prepared for frustration.

Like the first game, you can't really just save anywhere, even when it says it's saving. Completing some of the quests requires several staight hours of commitment, or else you lose most of your progress, having to start at the beginning of the zone again. Be prepared for frustration.

Like the first game, the UI is a buggy mess and you'll be fighting it the entire time. It's due to a mediocre PC port. Sometimes it would take me 5-10 minutes to simply scroll through my inventory without it sticking at the top.

Finally, there's DRM bullshit. You have to pay real money to unlock things already in the game, already installed on your computer.

"Is Watch Dogs perfect? No.

Was it Ubisoft's fault? No. Hype is a fan-created thing. Every time.
Is the game still gorgeous? Yes.

Is it worth your money? Yes.

With a fantastic single player story that shows you how dangerous our world can become (in a sense, this is in no way ""real"" hacking) by giving our security over to Big Brother without a way for the average citizen to monitor the people monitoring them, the game is a dystopian story that will send a chill or two down your spine.

The game itself has a decent amount of detail, while leaving out other details. Odd ones such as bullets not causing a splash in water, reflections not matching up, and cockpits of cars being static, or puddles being copy-pasted hundreds of times.
But then there's the parts that get it right. The rain forming on the ground, slowly and drops pinging off your hood. The ""people watching."" The feeling of a living city.

Then there is the integration of a Dark Souls meets Assassin's Creed multiplayer. It is great fun. Never should you turn it off, and definitely, you should download the companion app to chase other people and watch them fail as you control the cops and the city (available now on Android and iOS). You feel like the world is filled with other players, especially with the Four-Square-esque collectable game. Allowing you to collect gifts like money and become mayor of a hotspot.

The free roam was a let down, sadly. If you can even get it to work, there isn't much to do. They could have easily made a GTA styled online with Death Matches, or world PVE content such as Gang Hideouts and Fixer Contracts. None of which are there.
Races are boring, often resulting in only 2 or 3 participants. Online Decryption is so sad, I have only ever been in free for all matches, and they are always mid-game joining. So losing noteriety(spelling?) is happening often.

You cannot choose what you play either as far as sub types. You can choose decryption, but not if it is Teams or Free for All. 

Dont let this sway you, though. The first 3 mentioned (Tailing, hacking, and ctOS mobile) are a blast. You will invade other players, stalk them while pretending to be NPCs and just watch the stupid crap they do. Or hack them and watch as they run around desperately trying to find you. Or take the role of a cop and use the city against a player. Respectively described.
All of which can and will happen to you as well, with no warning.


The ambient music that kicks in is always top notch, but the actual soundtrack with ""radio"" music playing is attrocious. Turn it off. Immediately.


So is it worth your money? I'd say so. I'm having a blast, tons of collectables to find, places to explore, and easter eggs to uncover. Side missions such as solving a serial killer's murder-spree and stopping sex trafficking. The multiplayer is more than always fun if you let it happen naturally. 

I highly recommend only playing with a controller. It's almost impossible to act like an NPC with a keyboard and mouse.

Hope to see you in Chicago!",True

best game i've played yet,True
"After playing the game for free I decided to buy the game plus season pass, because I will definitely replay this game again. 
 
I liked Deus Ex: HR a lot, but overall the gameplay in MD feels better and more polished. There are no difficulty progression hurdles anymore like the boss fights in HR. In MD the difficulty progresses smoothly thoughout the game which I personally like a lot more. 
 
The hacking works about the same as in HR, but I rather use the new 'auto-hack tool' to get into computers and open locks. Unless hacking is directly missions related you can skip most of the 'loot' hacking. There is plenty of loot everywhere (normal difficulty) so the hacking is really just for players that wants to max upgrade all their weapons and stuff (which is not needed).

The maps are all well designed and there is enough of lore in the game to keep you interested and curious when you explore the map.  Graphically the game looks really crispy, lots of high-res textures everywhere and good graphics effects. Only the cutscenes look much lower relolution than the ingame graphics (same deal as with HR). I do see some inconsistencies in the graphic design here and there (such as a story character that has pens and pencils in his breast pocket while it is the future and everyone uses a pad/computer, or characters wearing '80s glasses and assecories, etc.

One slight annoyance in the game I have is the over-twitchy mouse movement. Aiming weapons can be a pain in the behind sometimes, because you can't get a steady(ish) aim. The mouse keeps twitching with minimal movement. during the game I have to set my mouse to low dpi setting just for the gun related combat. There are no mouse options in the game so you can only adjust it with your (gaming) mouse dpi settings. Oh and I can't change the FOV. It is okay, but a 90% FOV would have been better.
 
As for the story it okay as far as I've played, but there is less drama and emotional connections compared to the HR story. I feel less engaged and interested in the story and the background of the characters than I was in HR.

Some people disliked the game because of micro-trnasactions, but I have not even noticed them and I did not need them as far as ive played. I have my inventory completely filled as it is so there is absolutely no need to do any micro-transactions!
 
Overall I really like this game and you notice that there are many talented people behind this artistic project to make the game a reality. It is a polished tripple A artwork that belongs in your Steam library!

 
85/100


EDIT:  it took me 42 hours to complete the main story +all side missions. I have played it almost completely stealth and looted and explored everything on the maps. So as for playhours there is enough content. My character was very overpowered and I hardly used any of my filled inventory and the augmentations so looting everything is really not needed, you can do most of the game with just stealth melee attacks.",True
"I like the new medal and awards system the devs introduced. It sure makes it easier to get xp. Also, the graphics are much better than early access, but improvements can still be made what with some lag and strange glitches here and there. Overall, it is a very fun tactical shooter and fairly realistic-one shot and usually you're dead. It would be great if some new maps, customizable equipment and gore were added, but I'm not sure if that will happen. Still a great game if you're into the First World War. Just unlock the mg and you'll be fine.",True

"What an adventure! I ended up spending about 56 hours going through the main storyline, exploring the world as much as possible. Though I wish the game was a bit more generous when it comes to inventory management, the world itself more than makes up for it. It completely sucks you in.

"It's a cute game, the aesthetics are the best part. If you're looking for a short, sweet, first person platformer with some challenge this will be good for you. The story is pretty weak and mostly exists to string together gameplay areas.

The WORST PART about this game, by far, is the mechanics. It was damn near impossible for me to get through a few areas with the physics treating me like a ragdoll at times and an anvil at others. It's really easy to lose control of your character while jumping, and that's only made worse by the fact that you aren't in control of when the game saves your progress, so you often end up repeating some parts over and over and over.

I ended up getting so frustrated at times that I definitely wouldn't describe this as a ""relaxing"" experience to anyone.

"This is, hands down, the best hacker game I've played so far. 

There is no finance system, which is great. Means you can do the missions/assignements/whatever you call them just to help out and progress with the story. You don't have to grind dozens of copy-pasted ""download file from a server"" missions just to buy a software tool or a faster CPU. 

The missions are usually pretty straightforward, although some could use more of a clear objective along the lines of ""reply to this email with the password to THAT server"". Some missions, though... Project Juno... Best. Mission. Ever. You start with an IP address, you go and poke and come up with a link or another IP address hidden in some memo, or even a password to something you can't hack and you basically explore the net and look for a solution while nobody knows if a solution exists (well, it does, since this is a game, but you get the idea). The final mission and dtory outcome feel a bit underwhelming, but all-in-all, very nice game of holywood hacking.

The only thing that sucks is the music. Not a fan of techno, but most hacker games seem to have it. Is this a thing? Like another stereotype of hacker = shy, socially awekward nerd with zits and dorky glasses, who listens to techno? Anyway, that doesn't drag the overall experience down.

It has its share of oddities, but one gets familiar with it over time. Some of the missions glitch out and it doesn't register that I've reached the objective, so I need to reload from the last save point and do it again. It's happened 3 times so far. 
The ship stuff is interesting. It even has a GTA-style system of getting police attention. The map is huge, so it might take me a week or two to get through all of it.",True

The game isn't too technically deep for a RTS game.

You CAN earn every single thing in the game, but holy crap I don't have all of anything and I spent about 20 or so dollars extra on the game BESIDES the DLC. If you dislike Micro-transactions, YOU WILL NOT LIKE THIS GAME. IF you get the game, i'd get the 142 Units Added mod, it allows you to get any vehicle/infantry you want.

"I have been playing this for the past few days. Both single and multiplayer. One thing I have noticed is the amount of time being able to play each day. I think the timers should be extended just by a little bit for multiplayer to give time for story and unexpected events. (I passed out watching the old man eating from the dumpster at night). Also, most of the game in singleplayer is extended by the activities of fishing and other freeze frame moments like accessing your inventory. 
It does not have to be big, instead of like every 10 secs 10 mins go by, make it 15 secs 10 mins go by. Having to rush to do 1 minor activity such as fishing can feel very rushed unlike singleplayer. If I am not ready to bust ass the next morning, the day feels wasted, especially if it is a day before the festival. I know 4 people can make quite a difference on the farm, but the money is still shared and so trying to do all 4 peoples objectives at the same time can make money very difficult to keep well distributed.
Timer aside, this game is a very beautiful and fun. Something relaxing and unstressful that will one day be considered a classic to me both multiplayer and singleplayer. I am enjoying my playthrough very much, and with friends even more-so. I am glad you have finally brought this multiplayer idea to this game, one that is not broken either.
I enjoy the game a lot and have not experienced many bugs other than the hilarious fishing bug where if one person is fishing in another room, and the other player comes into that room. They will look half a mile away from thier fishing spot, then it corrects itself right after. Nothing game breaking and in fact I enjoy seeing it.

"The good:

Using a Win 7 gaming rig, the game looks gorgeous, plays exactly as the old games did and I'm having ZERO issues (so far). Exactly what Homeworld should be.

The bad:

At launch point there seems to be a few complaints in the forums that Win 8 and higher machines are having issues of various types and certain bits of high end hardware are causing issues. I'm sure these problems will be patched asap but it is noteworthy if you are using newer PCs. In short, maybe hold off a little till it's patched.



Personally I could not be happier with the game. Gearbox delivered and hopefully they rebuild Homeworld into the game series it deserved to be, It's certainly gives me hope that more classic games will be picked up and remastered for the modern gamer (such as xwing + tie fighter titles).

"TLDR:

The game is playable and enjoyable but riddled with bugs so much so you might mistake this game for an early access rather than an actual game release. The gameplay itself is simple but even then the AI of the animals is lacking in so many ways with pathfinding issues. I'd say that in my 300 ""harvests"" of animals that around 1/3 of those were from ""bugged animals"" which were either standing still, running in place or stuck on the terrain. I didnt buy a hunting game only to be shooting fish in a barrel.

Running the game on Max settings GTX 1080 i7-6500 3.4Ghz 16gig RAM rig runs the game perfectly, suffer from random audio crashes that have yet to be fixed despite many people suffering from it.

Single player missions are a joke, often asking you to take a picture of a deer but the quest itself is bugged and no amount of pictures or the distance you are to the deer will make a difference. 

With the latest patch the developers essentially ripped away whatever progression system the game has, the idea is that you hunt animals and gain EXP, weapon experience and money. The developers have made it possible to essentially have end game gear within hours of playing by drastically reducing the amouint of experience needed to unlock these weapons (seriously i'd say they reduced the amount needed by about 80%). So now i have the end game weapons and can kill animals easily from an enormous distance so now what? I could go ahead and try and hunt the biggest trophies in the game for the bragging rights on the global leaderboards like in theHunter classic? WRONG. There is a leaderboards amongst your friend list but thats it and even then it isnt even working right now and doesnt update itself often.

The game is nothing like a hunting game, if you think you are going to be sneaking up on groups of animals, picking out the biggest trophy and taking it down then think again! The game as it is punishes players who just hunt for trophies as far as progression is concerned. It's actually more beneficial for to kill every animal you see no matter what size or gender than going for a trophy, the difference in rewards between a trophy and a crappy female deer is tiny, maybe a third less money and EXP, the game doesnt even punish you for killing an animal with the wrong weapon nor does it punish you for failing to track a wounded animal down and finishing it off. so it gets to a point where you just shoot an animal and if you find that its barely wounded your better off just leaving it and finding some other animal to shoot at.

If the developers want this game to last longer than a few months then they really need to make some major changes to this game, which is a shame because it could be a very good game once they fixed all the bugs and actually made it feel like you were hunting rather than playing some arcade shoot em up with deers instead of zombies.

WIll change this review once game becomes more playable but if anyone is reading this right now please save your money for now, watch this game and keep an eye on its updates and maybe even catch it in a steam sale a few months down the line.",False

-Melee attacks from the Killer often connect with the model and fail to do any damage, while other swings don't connect even close to the model and damage still registers.

"Well, 
I bought this game to re-kindle my love of Mortal Kombat. 

I have played all the series finally now including this one, which bring me to my first point. 

Does the story line coincide with previous games and if so how? 
And what the hell is making characters viewable in the story mode but unplayable ? 

Man, i just want the old days of having an extensive list to choose from and being able to beat off my friends and their dad's.

All in all great gameplay, good graphics and the x-ray thing ? Man that's almost as chilllin as the time i walked in on my grandmother fucking a cucumber.

[*]The morality mechanic from previous games is thankfully missing

"Although the game had a bit of a rocky start, it has really improved, so don't let old reviews discourage you. The game's open world mechanics (e.g. base buliding and exploring) is very well done, and getting the felling that you are the firts player ever to set foot someplace is very cool. The story is a tad boring though, with almost all quests just being fetching and retrieving.

"Initial idea: 10/10
Execution: 3/10

I started playing DayZ when it was a mod for Arma, and I've loved the Idea ever since. After being frustrated out of DayZ I recently came back to DayZ after a 3 year break to see what it has become.

To be honest, I got my money's worth if you look at the experience I got from playing this game. I think it could have been so much more though if implemented competently. 

To give an example: If there is something you can pick up within a certain radius of you, it is considered an object that needs to be loaded in. As far as I can tell it works like that for every single little thing, even if it is in a stack, and even if that stack is inside a storage container. Which means that when you have a base with all your loot, at a certain point all of those items (every individual gun/bullet/nail/whatever) needs to be loaded in client side. This creates a lag spike in a circle around your base, which will more often than not kill you if you're driving. It'll also give players a way to triangulate where your base is at. (you don't even need 3 measurements since you only get the spike when approaching)

This is just one of the reasons why you want to avoid travelling by car. You'll spend more time fixing and finding new parts for your car than you'll spend glitching it around. No I'm not calling it driving, because that's not how it feels. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against putting some effort in. Just know that you can crash your car because the game can't handle you going too fast on a straight stretch of emtpy road. 

Furthermore you'll probably need a degree in IT and a lot of time to be able to properly run a server. 

I could go on, but I think you'll get my point. If future me is sensible I've now uninstalled for the last time.",False
"In this game you let a circle ride along a waveform that you control. You can make the waveform taller or shorter, but you can also widen or compress it. And while you do so you have to make sure that the waveform follows the line of the stars that you collect. Sounds simple? Maybe the first few levels, but it gets gradually harder. Transporters, distortion, black holes and more make your journey more exciting as you try to get as many lights as you can!",True
"Now I can't say I've played a lot of this game mostly as I have only started playing it today. 

HOWEVER, there are a few things that I feel I need to say as well as ask. I am going to go back through some of the issues I have had in the last two hours of play. 

Firstly the colonists' AI/IA (Artificial intelligence/Intelligent Agents) ; Now I understand us as the 'Overseer' of these projects I can not control the colonists directly. There are a few things I feel are laking and some that I just plain wrong or a bug.
So with the lack of complete control (which I have no issues with as I have played many games like this), the fact there is no prioritising ablity is a surprising and rather irritating issue.
Next, Lava. So I am amazed that these extremely advanced and trained colonists don't understand that when lava is coming towards them to RUN! I lost two colonists, one robot and a chicken due to one drop of lava coming down straight outside the room.

Next, you have the weather. This planet seems to be worse than England for how many different kinds of weather you can get in one day. I had rain, fog, asteroids, solar flares and earthquakes in less than a full day. Now I don't mind too much. Apart from that when an earthquake happens, everyone becomes useless...even when they are right next to a fire. O yes did I forgot to mention that in the issues with the AI? (well no I just thought it worked better here).
Another issue I had was an earthquake that lasted over a day and continued when I started t new game.

Then the tutorial is a bit unpredictable, and when I had to reload as it is not very restriving in events, I had to restart the game and the tutorial. Why? Well, the fact that almost everything became unviewable and my mouse vanished. 

The last thing I am going to mention is that fact that the UI (User Interface) is very chaotic and not very user friendly. Now it's not bad enough that I would have mentioned it usually however with everything else put together it needed to be mentioned.

Now there is a lot of interesting protention to the game; however, I feel it's like it is still in beta, and I would not say it is a finished game just yet. However, it is good to see there are still updates coming out. 

I hope to see these issues ironed out as this looks to like a game I could sink days into playing.
Until then I can't give this game a thumbs up.",False
"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM

"Red Faction Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered's performance and visuals are noticeably better than its original release,  but its gameplay is still a little repetitive and rough around the edges. Using guns feels laughably underpowered against enemies, yet melee attacks with the sledgehammer are almost guaranteed one-hit kills.

Message quest is not your traditional adventure point and click game. It contains fun mini puzzles, which are easy to grasp on and hidden (a Mario refereced) easter egg and no inventory to worry about. The game has a story rich plot and gives you the choice in the characters' Dialouges or monolouges. I personally loved the touch of humor they added in the game, so the game wont fell dull.

"I spent an entire summer playing this game when I was in highschool. My dad introduced me to it, and it holds a lot of nostalgic value for me. When I discovered it on here, he and I both got very excited, and I had to pick it up, though I'd be lying if I was afraid it would not have held it's value after almost 20 years. 

My fears were assuaged immediately. Descent: Freespace - The Great War plays great on my Windows 10 PC and is just as fun as it ever was. I did have some initial issues with it locking up on load, but I found a work around online that worked great and it starts up immediately and easily every time, now. The plot is way more that I remembered, and the attention to detail with the flight decks is much appreciated and shows that, originally, the developers wanted to put out a good game. I have played through it twice already since picking it up in the Steam Autum Sale about two weeks ago, and I'm about to fire it up again. The nostalgia has been well-worth the $10 I spent on both this and the sequel, Freespace 2, and the gameplay experience has far exceeded my expectations.

If you loved the original in 98, and want to go back to it, I encourage you to do so - you won't be disappointed. If you have never played this, but have enjoyed other space flight sims from the same era, it's more than worth $5 I paid in the sale. Check it out!",True

Great game. The fact that its h1 and dayz is awesome.
The fact that there are a large number of vehicles to use is awesome.
The number of weapons.

a compass would be awesome please
maybe a few more zombies in urban areas
add some unique melee weapons. a sword or something.
water wells on farms to refill bottles and canteens
craftable bows and arrows
craftable vehicle(s)?
bullet conversion please. as long as you have a reload bench. it takes forever to find 5 rounds of .308

"Skeptical at first, I decided to try it at a reduced cost.  I was not disappointed.  While it's not flashy like many new games, it has wonderful character art, and the writing is great.  I *did* find myself occasional skimming some of the readable content on files I came across, but I always paid careful attention to dialogue.  There, every choice I made mattered, in a way I haven't felt in a long time.  

I was able to advance quite far in the game, so character development was satisfying, but I wasn't a good in the end.  I'd say it can be quite the challenging game, but not *too* challenging.  For this game, I was interested in a relaxing ""dungeon explorer"" game with a good story to fill my time between table-top roleplaying games that were in a lull.  I got what I wanted out of the ""normal mode.""  Even then I still failed and had to reload on occasion, although my character was far from optimized.  Generally I play such games (all games really) on the hardest mode possible, and this game would no doubt be quite vicious on that.  It would require optimizing the character.  FYI - I played a face character with amazing charisma who acted as a decent shaman.  Mid-game I picked up conjuring, which eventually got quite high.  I threw a variety of points into other things to round myself out for roleplaying purposes (Int, Willpower, Rifle).  I'd definitely recommend picking up a high Charisma still, as it gives etiquettes which in turn allow special dialogue options that both helped and increased the richness of the story.  

The stories were classic Shadowrun stories, full of grit and backstabbing, secret organizations and fairly mature content done in a suitably mature way.  An all-round pleasure.  While short, the game oozes flavor out of its isometric rpg self.  Wasteland 2 was not quite so flavorful (while longer and very good in dialogue).

Overall: 8.5",True
Can't wait for more content.,True
"Not a whole lot of time in the game, but with only a core Arena mode and familiar DnD ruleset, not a whole lot of time is necessary to make a decent accessment. 

While there's no story here, nor any other fluff to distract you, you'll find what is here, is a foundation for something pretty great just around the corner. If you're into DnD character customization, leveling and turn-based combat, you'll have enough to keep you entertained throughout the rest of the Early Access development process. 

At this point, I feel that story and world implementation are just going to stand in my way from my next encounter anyway. I mean we're all pretty much here because we love DnD, and we love rolling and then leveling characters. Gear is already present as well, if you were worried we would have any loot to find and/or buy. 

So, for less than $10, get the core of what you enjoy right now and go off and fight the endless hoards. When the rest of the game is implemented, then go back and explore the world as seen through our Dev Team's eyes.",True

"I've been a longtime fan of the strategy genre and I count many many many hours in games ranging from Rome: Total War to Stellaris. I can safely say that no other game reaches this game's ambition, scope and depth. If you're looking to actually, realistically experience what a country leader must deal with this is the closest you can get. 

That being said, they have overextended their ambitions and the amount of bugs in the game is unreasonable. For instance, taxing industrial pollution gives more revenue than direct taxes on companies (measuring both as the same % of revenue), building a single wind farm gives you the same energy as a nuclear power plant, offering a miniscule solidarity allowance (basically UBI for poor people) skyrockets your popularity immensely, price reduction as a % of total price in state owned industries keeps creeping up for some reason to the point that you need to keep readjusting the % each quarter or so, industrial espionage simply doesn't work in some countries and I could go on and on. I've e-mailed them a few times with the bugs I found and they were fairly receptive but it seems they just don't update the game. Despite this amount of bugs being incredibly frustrating at times this was to be expected simply because of the huge ambition in the game and the small resources of the developer and none of them are absolutely game breaking (except for the few times it crashed so save every year or so).

Despite the bugs, I've found there are structural issues with the game, like not displaying enough information on infrastructure to, for instance, actually know if highways are needed and between where or if ports are needed etc. Generally, the player will have a hard time nagivating the UI. International trade, the EU and the Euro are VERY simplified. On the other hand, war in general is not smooth at all, requires incredible micromanagement and I think should have been simplified together with riot handling. In my opinion, the developers should have focused on the simulation aspect (where the game thrives) and not allocated resources to any type of military unit management because war and riot handling are too micromanagement intense and games like Stellaris or Attila Total War already do it infinitely better. Also, relations with other nations are VERY hard to change. For instance, playing as a newly elected right-wing Venezuelan goverment that just overthrew the Maduro and wants to get close to the US? Pray that the US has a natural catastrophe and donate them a fortune, otherwise they still hate you.

What none of those games do however, is simulating the impact of policy changes to the minimum wage, government interest rates, healthcare and education system, retirement age etc. etc. The closest game out there that I've found is Democracy 3 and it barely scratched the surface this game digs into.

All things considered, I would not recommend this game to everyone. It is way too bugged ridden and overpriced to appeal to broad audiences, but this is game is one of a kind to me still and I respect the ambition behind it.",True

The game worked well for a solid few hours of gameplay; however, when I turned off the game and came back to play it the next day, the game shows the units invisible except for their shadows. Also, the whole map keeps bugging and flashing in a way that would give a photo-sensitive kid a seizure. I have already tried unistalling and redownloading the game several times from Steam and deleted all the memory, but that hasn't work. Guess this is what happens when a guy tries to take advantage of a 75% off sale on Steam on the 4th of July, like f*** me right.

It's also got a dedicated online community and it's very easy to get matches. Single player content is limited, there's a story mode which somewhat resembles classic singleplayer, and an abyss mode which is kind of like an ""unending"" trial.

"Do you like building stuff? Do you like warships, submarines, planes, spaceships, and tanks? Enjoy trying to optimize systems? Then FtD may be the game for you!

The first thing to say about From the Depths is that it's got quite a learning curve. It's not a super hard to understand game, especially since there are pre-built hulls and guns you can utilize, but people with several hundred hours are still ""beginners"". Every weapon system, engine, and method of defense has it's own mechanics with their own pros and cons, and all of that on top of trying to keep ships affordable for use in campaign. But it's so satisfying to improve, and nothing is better than looking back at old designs and seeing all the things you can do better now.

And that's just the designer. You can't forget that on top of this ship building game is a simple strategy game, as well as some challenges and an ""adventure mode"" that sees you try to survive against random enemies as you build up your ramshackle craft.",True

"Hexen Beyond Heretic is so awesome it truly surpassed and went far beyond Heretic

Pros
The attention to detail in the levels is great with splashing water, sizzling lava, leaves caught in the wind and destructible items like windows vases trees and mushrooms 
The enemies all look and sound great
The 5 difficulty modes are well balanced and the names for said modes change depending on which class you pick I'd recommend the 4th difficulty setting 
The play styles for the 3 classes are very well varied with different weapons, stats and slight changes to certain levels my favorite was the Cleric but the Fighter is probably the best choice for newcomers
Most of the weapons and spells are really fun to use my personal favorite would be the Clerics cross that shoots ghosts that gib everything :D
The soundtrack is pretty good 
This game may have a low amount of enemy types compared to other 90's fps games but the enemies are so well done that adding more could be considered redundant 
The death animations are excellent
I like how if you freeze an enemy you don't have to worry about them thawing out
The levels are huge and complex so much so I had to stop and take notes to remember where everything is now for some people these levels may be overwhelming but I found it to be pretty fun to figure everything out on my own
As far as 90's fps games go the boss fights aren't half bad
The story may just be a bunch of text screens at the end of each chapter and the main villain Korax insulting you at the beginning of each chapter so even though it's simple it's very epic in the execution with epic writing and a great voice actor for Korax 
One major improvement from Heretic is now you have quick select keys for your inventory
The secret levels add some extra charm mostly because thy're more like standard 90's fps levels just run around and kill everything find some secrets and the exit
Many levels have randomized elements to them so every time you go back to them you get a different item or a puzzle may have a different solution each time you replay the game
A couple of the chapters have exclusive enemy types to match the theme of the levels their placed in
In Heretic you could turn your enemies into chickens now you can turn them into pigs not only that but you yourself can turn into a pig aswell
Unlike Heretic I actually found myself using my items a lot more  often this time
You can look up and down, jump in this game and fly ok now that is epic for a game running on the DOOM engine

Cons
Now with most 90's fps games you'll get a decent weapon within the first level but with this game it's more like an adventure getting just one new weapon per chapter with each class getting 4 weapons because of this a fare few parts in chapter 1 can feel pretty cheap especially if your playing as the Cleric who has the worst starting weapon ever luckily he has devastating poison bombs but still it also doesn't  help that the weapon pickup locations change depending on which class you pick now this isn't to bad for the most part but I found the Clerics weapons to be to well hidden
The flechettes change depending on which class you pick the Fighter throws his like a grenade the Cleric drops a poison bomb and the Mage drops a bomb I'd prefer it if I always had the option to throw the flechettes 
You know it's kinda disappointing that at the end when you finally face Korax that he doesn't have anything to say he just roars and stuff what is he shy in person? It's a shame considering how epic his voice was
The shield spamming enemies can suck it seriously how does a shield block being struck by lightning or being lit on fire and to add insult to injury by chapter 3 the shields shoot lazers and just to rub some salt to those wounds the mages flechettes can go through the shields but nothing else can because magic?
It's kinda annoying that chapter 1 doesn't have a boss fight and chapter 4 reuses the boss from chapter 3
The Mage sucks so bad that if it wasn't for cheats he might've ruined the game for me first of all his speed is to slow I know he has a lower speed stat but it gets annoying second of all his starting weapon is too good it's a wand that fires like a pistol with shots that pierce through targets and it has infinite ammo my only problem with this is because of the major suckage of the other weapons you'll use this thing a lot it may be useful but it's also boring to use third of all the freeze spell requires way to many hits to kill anything each shot uses 3 blue mana and most enemies can take 3-5 hits so that's 9-15 mana to kill one thing compare this to the Fighters axe which takes 2-3 swings to kill most enemies with 2 blue mana per hit at 4-6 mana to kill one enemy and best of all it functions like a crappy modern fps shotgun so if your more than 3 feet away the amount of damage it does takes a major nosedive fourth of all his lightning spell seems pretty devastating at first and well worth the 5 green mana cost until I noticed that it's random how much damage it does sometimes it can insta-kill the mightiest beasts like the Chaos Serpents other times it can't even kill the lowest of the low enemies wtf man?! and fifth of all his ultimate weapon kinda sucks it uses 15 blue and green mana and what does it do? fire 3 devastating homing rockets now that may sound cool but oh boy did they screw it up these rockets aren't very good at clearing a room heck sometimes they can't kill even one shield guy and the homing aspect sucks because the rockets need like a square mile of free space to turn properly otherwise they just hit a wall

So overall despite the Mage classes best efforts to ruin this game with his all flash and no substance gameplay the excellence that is the Fighter and the Cleric  shines trough and delivers one of my personal favorites heck this may be my all time favorite fantasy game so check it out but don't say I didn't warn you about the Mage",True

"With 1003 hours in game (playing pretty much since the beginning off and on), overall I have to give this game a positive review, but with a few caveats.  Why the caveats?  Well, the official servers are, and have always been, a mess.  Even on PvE servers you get a LOT of griefing (just a few examples of this are people luring aggressive dinos to destroy your buildings etc, people dragging your sleeping body into the sea to drown you whilst you are logged out or people building foundations near to your base so that you can't expand at all), they're also VERY laggy quite often.  As to PvP servers, they seem to have attracted very toxic PvPers, a quick look through the discussions and you will quickly read about mega tribes cheating etc, or the age old problem of killing new players the second they spawn, before they can even get started.

After those caveats you're probably wondering why still the positive review?  Well, basically I am reviewing the game itself, NOT the servers.  Pretty much the entire time I have been playing I have either rented my own unofficial servers, or have hosted them myself for my family to play on together.  Sometimes the rented ones have been terrible, with bad lag etc, and this is the exact same problem that the official servers have, hosts overselling them to the point of them been rubbish.  There are plenty of unofficial servers out there though with a good community playing on them (including nice clustered servers where you can move between maps freely), along with the options of renting your own, hosting one yourself or even just playing single player.  Sure the game itself has some bugs, but these are continuously been worked on.  The state the game is in now has improved MASSIVELY upon the state it first entered Early Access in.  Sure it won't run at all well on anything low end hardware wise but that's just the march of progress pushing as always.  It's the very paradigm of PC gaming.

Another caveat I am going to give is the lack of any real story or structured content.  This really is a game that is best played with other people where the players make the story and the content themselves, a sandbox if you will.  You have to put a lot into the game to get any real enjoyment out of it, setting yourself goals, challenges etc.

As to the price, well I'm reviewing the game not the price.  Would I pay nearly £50 for the condition the game is currently in?  No, but luckily I got it during EA.  Wait for a sale to get it, there are plenty of them.

TLDR; To get the most out of this game you need to find a good unofficial server, with a good community on it, or set up your own.  Wait for a sale to purchase.  It's a sandbox game, it doesn't spoon feed you story or lead you through the content.",True

"I know i'm very late to this one, but this has probably been the best 20 bucks i've spent on games in 2017 - and will be incredibly hard to beat in 2018.
		
On the one hand this is an old-zelda style adventure game, except the combat is actually great and satisfying (albeit a bit easy), supported by a almost-Platinum-style combat-score, upgrade and equipment system. And it's all presented using one of the most gorgeous and memorable art style imaginable - which looks stunning in high resolutions - and scored by an incredible soundtrack. Load times on modern systems are basically non-existent and drawing with the mouse works flawlessly. 
		
On the other hand this is a game where you play as a dog god that constantly gets bored and falls alseep when npcs have lengthy exposition dumps, you pay 100000 yen to unlock a taunt move called ""golden god"" that lets you pee on enemies in combat, you become a more powerful god by feeding adorable animals or digging up giant clovers (rip Clover Studios), and generally solve everyone's problems while often letting them believe they did it themselves (which brightens their day even more). It's funny and charming and filled with likable characters, and even its mocking feels endearing instead of mean spirited. The story is engaging throughout, bringing you to a ton of unique and interesting and memorable locations, and after a few neat twists sticks the landing very nicely. 
		
Difficulty stays very managable throuhough, and the game offers a ton of safety nets on top of it, still the combat offers a lot of depth with many of the numerous enemy types having weaknesses that allow for very quick knockouts using a huge variety of weapon and brush moves and their combinations. Its skill ceiling isn't quite bayonetta or MGR, but for me personally the added drawing element with mouse support might make it my most enjoyable out of all the three.	
		
For completionists sidequesting and exploration is generally rewarded with one of 99 ""bead"" collectibles (+1 for finishing the game) that grant you what's basically a godmode (get it) cheat on new game+ for a fun victory lap. The optional quests and challenges are sometimes hidden behind some very obscure stuff but also contain some of the most charming and mechanically fun things to do, so i'd recommend looking up a few hints on a guide to avoid missing them before you go past the very explicitely stated point of no return. After over 50 hours my only complaint was that there wasn't more of it.

I can't remember the last time a game had a tone this joyfully wholesome and heartwarmingly charming, and i couldn't imagine a better, whimsical game to detox from 2017 (and possibly within 2018). These days a lot of games feel abrassively hostile and more and more common actively predatory towards the player - even 12 years after release Okami felt like a warm hug when you needed one the most.

It has some decent puzzles, mostly solved by exploring and finding the right items. It has multiple endings but the plot is not the greatest and it is relatively short. Overall I am left feeling this game is okay so take it or leave it if it takes your fancy.",True

"If you can get past the cartoony graphics and historical inaccuracies its a great game. A few negative reviews ive read about this game seems a little heavy handed. The game does need a little polish here and there and also has great potential for its gameplay to be expanded and deepened.  I think it is better than FTL which i didn't enjoy as much as i thought i would when i brought that game. This game can be really tense, and will be so early on when you dont have much armor on your plane and your crew are green. 

One mission i landed with but a fumes for fuel and another minute i would of lost the plane.  It can get a little hectic at times, a fire, downed crew and your gunners need ammo. Sometimes its just bad luck. It can suck when you lose your precious crew who have leveled up. But that is no different to XCOM or other games where you can lose your skilled units. Knowing you might not make it back or lose some crew gives it the tension it needs. Remove that and make it too easy and this game would get boring fast.  Some skills unlocked allow you to choose a custom waypoint where you like which combined with advanced radar warnings you can fly around some problems. 

The skills crew can learn as they level up deepen the game, such as being able to mix your fuel so that you run lean to get more milage. One mission my navigator and another crewmen was wounded and i couldnt navigate back to HQ until i had healed the navigator and i was deep in enemy territory and had a long trip back, sadly i ran out of fuel after making back, so close so far. There are some minor things that need addressing here and there but on the whole the game runs well.

There is no combat pause, but you can pause the game in the form of opening the Options screen. I feel a pause button would make this game less intense and you dont have to have lightening reflexes to play this game. 

In closing this game has potential for more content and gameplay mechanics. A very fun game to play.",True

"The console puzzles were a lot of fun and should have been what the game was really focused on.  Adding in more of those with progressively harder difficulty would have been a lot of fun.  I could have really gotten behind a game that had more focus on this.

Unfortunately it felt like I was enduring the rest of the game in order to get to these fun small bits.  The game wasn't very cohesive - I couldn't get a handle on what it was actually trying to be.

Level design is bizarre and disjointed.  Beginning started off well, but then you start running into massive empty hallways, cooridors that serve no purpose, gargantuan, cavernous rooms, etc.  The *very* beginning of the game felt like what I'd expect an actual space station with this kind of aesthetic to feel like, but shortly after that things just stopped making sense.  I could never actually get myself immersed in the game and story - I was constantly reminded, and not in a good way, that I was playing game.

Voice acting and writing is cringe-worthy in multiple parts.  Forgiveable, if enough else had been done right.

The ending was so infuriating I would up giving up and not even completing it.  I walked away feeling like I was missing nothing.  It's just such a stark departure from the rest of the game with absolutely no point at all.

Even with all the things wrong with this, the ending is what ultimately resulted in me withholding my recommendation, at least at the current price level.  If the ending were different- it wouldn't be a great game by any stretch of the imagination, but I could at least recommend it.  Or if it were cheaper.",False

Reinstalling does not help, community fixes do not help, it's all on Rockstar now. This game is not worth a purchase until it's playable.

edit: 6/7/2015
I sent in a ticket to Rockstar Support over a month ago, I got about seven responses during this time, four of these were fix suggestions. The fixes suggested by Rockstar Support were almost always things I had already tried myself (such as lowering settings, changing which DirectX the game was running on). There were also suggested fixes that were completely unrelated to the issue I was having. It doesn't seem like they look at the actual info sent to them and just suggest random fixes that have ""worked for other players"". It's been almost two weeks since Rockstar Support has last responded to a message of mine. Maybe the issue is just too complicated, but I haven't been able to play this game properly since its release so it doesn't seem acceptable.",False

"I originally had posted a positive review and had recommended this game to a bunch of people personally.

As someone who has spent so much time in this game because of the PvE side of things, I gave up on the game once the PvE servers moved outside NA (making it unplayable due to high ping) and had hoped things would change down the line. The recent Developer Q&A has shown that their focus is now solely on PvP, and see this as more of a sandbox PvP game than an MMO with PvE elements as originally advertised, so I think I'm done with this game for good.

If you're looking for a sandbox PvE experience and have your heart set on giving Atlas a try, I'd really only recommend it for the Darkside RP private server. They're amazing. Otherwise don't bother.",False

"The PS1 games will always be the ones I think of when I think of Tomb Raider; less action and more exploration/puzzles.  That's why I think this might end up being my favourite TR game as it still has the classic TR gameplay the originals had with some modern day polish.

So far this seems like a very nice HD remake of the 1st game with much more friendly controls to pick up and play (used K&M so far).

Looks and runs great, I'd recommend turning off full screen effects though (weird screen blur effect).

So if you prefered the older games but the clunky controls and rough visuals get in the way of picking them up to play again you'd probably love this.  And at 80% off atm it's a great deal.",True

"War.. War never changes..?

Ok, in fact the Total War series changed quite much, often to get better, sometimes for the worse (Empire and it´s clone armies, i´m looking at you). Anyway, arguably one of the biggest changes was CAs turn from historical to Fantasy warfare. By far not all fans of the series were happy about that (and some still are not, but hey, you can never please everyone). But they implemented it quite well. 
The Heroes were born, for one - which can influence every Battle, quite more drastic than every General was ever able to. Also storyline elements from Warhammer lore were implemented - the Quests, which pepped up the dry warmongering days, quite a bit. Last but not least CA used the biggest advantage of the Fantasy world to it´s full extend - Variety!
If i mentioned Empire above, of course many of the historical games (Shogun, Three Kingdoms etc) had the problem of very similiar looking and feeling sides and armies. In Warhammer they lived the variety of the world to it´s fullest, so that you even have different UIs for each faction and quite different gameplay tweaks. 
This way each playthrough with a different faction, feels quite different and offers you new possibilities and tactics. This is what they continued also in most of their DLCs and what needs to be appreciated to keep a game alive in over three years, with really new content, in nowadays fast living gaming society. At once i only could name Paradox, for a similiar longelivity of their products, by providing fresh content (without speaking about MMOs etc ofc).

Graphically and technically the game improved quite well too, as at the beginning there were quite some ugly animations and ofc bugs, which are - mostly - corrected by now, so that you can even have a nice multiplayer campaign by now.
The one and only drawback for me is CAs typical ""endgame"" modus operandi, in bringing some new and overkill enemy as ""final boss"", here the Chaos Invasions. I never liked this forced way, but this can very well be personal taste.

Conclusio: If you like Total War gameplay and or (Warhammer) Fantasy, you should give the game a try - and look forward to the third part, which hopefully will bring among other things the diplomacy improvements Three Kingdoms had.

"Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.

This game is still not ready for prime time. Hell it isn't even ready for day time tv or 5am reruns.

- Some questlines cannot be completed due to the randomisation bugging out (in my scenario I have to plug my science 
   officers brain in to a PC that is in a building buried and entirely filled in undercround).

- The in game manuel does a poor job of explaining concepts. Or in the case of base building, how pieces work together.

- Base construction is beyond fiddly. You have dozens of pieces to choose from, but the peices only 'connect' with a 1/3 of 
   the asorted pieces.
   The marker you use to 'stake your claim' for your base cannot be moved.
   If you choose to move your base you (or at least I did) loose more than 1/2 of your invested resources; the game doesn't 
   even tell you that you CAN reclaim these resources.
   If you do finish building a base you are happy with and modify the terrain the game will only save 1/3 of the terrain 
   modifications turning your beautifully craftd home into swiss cheese.
   You will always require base materials to make the most trivial thing and there is no way for these resources to be auto 
   acquired of acquired more easily.

- The teleport machanic is a welcome change yet if you want to travel back your base the game 'ports you back to the 
    base marker rather than the item you spent so long creating.

- The biggest and most frustrating thing that has been around is the inventory system. You are constently fighting iwth 
   either spare or reclaiming / recalling resources from ether a container, ship orfreighter. How this wasn't #1 on the 1st 
   patch is beyond me.

""Disliked..""  Ha.  Purchased a, third (? {in my defense, I gamestopped it once, then got the premo edition 2 yrs later for ps4; why, what is wrong with me}) time, just to play the Resolution off of it.  Which I9 is barreling through with grace and whimsy. 
 
It's just unfortunate I now will no longer bother pursue visiting Peru or such, again sort of, because this amazing work of woe-ness.  the guys that pop on ahead of the game each time, did a orgasmic job (I really mean that) with the launch client, and all the various and whopping in and out of game options for all forms of any sort of optimization.  On the accessibility board, it gets a ridiculous, ""go **** yourself off, Charlie,""  cause you can, it's safe and optimized here.  

Specs?  I don't know what it can't do.  My hardware seemingly got it, but it looks like it could do more even, shiii, I'd say, bounce it up to 8k all day probably if you got the screens and hardware to burn, and have realized that medium already.  Do what ever you want.  I never realized the definition here, and how much of it's fully rendered from stock any way.  

Gamewise?  I laugh at your feeble prejudice that stopped you from ever playing this entry or the second (yeah, I understand the first was a raccous coed blow my brains out fest, with 90's les, ""ladies in comfortable shoes,"" esq romantic undertones, sure, I digress tho got a review to write).  The gameplay is equal parts pay attention and try, and you're going to be  bad bad mudha once you get the rhythm, even tho you swing a jagged, razor sharp blade, like a, you know, ""girl.""  The platforming is exceptional.  The combat, either stealth and bow, or stealth set up to run and gun, AAA better than Holly or Bali, glory.  Secrets and extras galore.  I'm going in second play through, settle down the 4k a little you know that play through really... so beautiful.  This playthrough, res all the way through the screen.  

Enix, give mac more of your catalogue.  At least, the old as dirt FF.  Which, please.  CD, amazing professionals and artist, and lovers of spalunking evidently, proveyors.  Thank you all for this AAAAA-5 title.  Kick it, ""mormon underwear.""

"This is one of the best games I’ve played in awhile.  Dropped off for bit and came back to a game that has had so many free content and community suggestions implemented that it almost seems criminal I am not charged for it. 

It had a wide range of custom difficulty options, make it as hard or as laid back as you like.  I recommend starting on the easier ones, because there is a lot going on and it will take a a bit to get the hang of it. Are you a masochist? Play impossible! 

It’s an open ended Space RPG like no other.  Need structured story elements? Follow the vignettes and story hooks.  Want to sandbox? That is ok as well.  The world and events will spin along without your intervention in their own way.  Contacts playing a game of thrones like simulation in the background scheming and playing against, or for each other. 

Want to focus on crew combat and boarding actions? Go for it.  Exploring, salvaging, privateer, bounty hunter, diplomat.  I even read where someone made a medical ship and went planet to planet with a ship full of doctors like a galactic Red Cross helping the locals. 

It really is fantastic.  Depending on your experience with deep games, it may take a bit to get over the hump, but oh is it worth it. 

And a great set of developers and listen to feedback (within reason) that have supported the game and community for years. 

There are far too few games like this, or devs willing to go for years of free support, expansion, polishing, and general TLC for a product. 

Great stuff.  Just be willing to let it sink it’s teeth into you.  Probably on easy to start out-lol.  I’ve got 100’s of hours in (admittedly some of that is it on pause while I do dad stuff) and am still coming back to it.

"  I can see this game has lots of fans. I guess I'm not one of them. I like the art but I dont really care or care very little  about any charicter in this game. The races: humans, varl, horseborn, dredge...there is nothing particularly cool about them, They are not very new, except the dredge, but man, these onese are not really interesting, stone copies of people with shields and weaponry... The story is complicated and unique in a way, I can see that. But it's a boring story for me. I don't want to see the end of it. I dont like when I have no choice to play for some charicters, like half of the story is about that Black Raven leader and his team. I dont like him and its exosting that I have to bear with it if I want to see the end. But did I actually saw the end of the story? No. Though I definetely saw the end of the game. 
  Same as with Star Wars: the Last Jedi. After playing this game to the end, I feel frustrated and I am not going to continue with this franchise. 

  I understand those who like this game though. Cool stuff, vikings and their gods. But for me it looks/sounds like Miguel Serrano writings. Dark impact. I have this strong associations going through that story. And I am not happy about that.",False
"Bioshock: Infinite launches you into the floating city of Columbia, a floating city of American ideals. You play as Booker DeWitt, an ex-Pinkerton agent sent to repay his debt from gambling by retrieving a woman named Elizabeth.

From the get-go, your intial launch into Columbia in nothing less than absolutely stunning. From the vibrant and beautiful colour palettes to the bright sunny skies that illuminate the city strees, Columbia is gorgeous to look at. Each and every part of it has been painted with such precise details and the citizens make effort to give breathing life to the imaginative world. You'll often find yourself staring off into the skies aweing or just absorbing the history the world has to offer. 

Of course, for the masterful piece of artwork it is, it is also a video game! The combat gameplay is solid and smooth. Much like the previous titles, you have access to both guns and vigors (the replacement for plasmids). There's plenty of freedom to create your own violent method of dispatching your enemies by  stringing vigors and weapon combos together. However, one of the best parts about the gameplay is the sky-lines, a rollercoaster speed trip through the skies of Columbia. There's plenty of large sky-lines to sail across, and the tight controls allow you to gracefully glide around and plan your enemies' deaths with guerilla tactics. You can also upgrade your combat abillities by purchasing upgrades from vendors and finding gear (which are equipment items that increase a certain skill). 

However, one of the most amazing aspect of the game is Elizabeth, a wonderous emotional character whom partners with you on your journey. Her body movements and expressions are amazing, showing emotion and thought with great execution. She's an easily likable character and you won't ever feel like she's some AI partner who assist you, but something more human. During combat, she will provide you ammo, health, and salts; although, it'll never feel like she's making the game to easy for you, and when she's gone, you'll probably miss her. 

The story itself is thought-provoking and filled with many controversial topics, but never will tell you which one thing is right and wrong, but leaving it up to you as a player to decide which is morally correct. It starts out simple and gets increasingly more complex as you progress; closing it all with one of the best finales I've seen in a while. 

There is some gripes I have with the game, although they are just minor. You're only limited to two weapons at a time, and often find yourself sticking to your upgraded weapon for most of the playthough. On a playthough on Hard or 1999 Mode, the game sometimes becomes a scavenger hunt for your best weapons because there is no machine that lets you purchase the gun itself, but rather just upgrade them.

In example I am more of a sneaking arround, with my weapon of choice being an ax and a rifle. My friends prefers to hunt the robots using a pistol, shotgun, and dynamite.  In multiplayer I use an alarm clock to call near by robots then hide in the distance. When enough are close to the clock, my friends throws the dynamite to get as many as we can.

"Playing this game awoke a side of me that had previously been buried. A dark side full of rage and anger, possessed of a terrible bloodlust and a willingness to quench its thirst for carnage. I have split open skulls with axes and removed limbs with a sabre. I have burned men alive and kicked them off of ledges into the rushing waters below, watching as they are swept away by the pitiless currents. I have remorselessly butchered the foes who stood before me and the allies who have been in my path. I have slaughtered peasants with no means with which to defend themselves, and have desecrated the bodies of the fallen with my blades and my bludgeons. And I have done all of this not for king or for honor or for gold or even for achievments.

I have done these things because I thirsted for blood. And I was not disappointed.

The bugs are not server wide in the sense that everyone wont get them, i have not got a single bug since playing, the clicking of units will take abit of getting used to but other than that ive found this to be the same game it used to be, and i only played the demo back all those years ago and i played that demo * 1 lvl * about 100+ times, i didnt play the game till another 5-8 years later, or atleast i tried to after paying £20 to buy the pc verson that didnt work :( 

In short, buy the game if you loved the first version, if there is bugs who gives a crap they can patch those out in no time, and lets be honest its £4.. i didnt even blink when i see that price i honestly expected it to be about £10.

"Man, this game is awesome. 

  I'm a big MGS fan and this game gameplay-wise is the best one imo. There are major issues with the story but I will touch on that later.

  First off the controls and gameplay are stellar. The game never forces you to be 100% stealthy but to get a ""S"" rank on every mission (which you need to do to see the games big plot twist) you'll have to not kill anyone and avoid being detected to maximize your score. So you can go loud but don't expect to see everything the game has to offer unless you stealth around.  

  It's a lot of fun to upgrade motherbase and watch your army expand. I hear some people complain about the arbitrary wait times on the S&D research but I've never found it to be an issue since there is so much to do that you can just go off on a side op or main mission until it is complete. They also complete even when the game is not being played. Some people say this is too much like a mobile game but I've never found it to be an issue. There are very few research projects that will take that long. Most of the more elaborate ones are 30 minutes and I have seen them go over an hour but that is rare. But the game is so fun to play that the time will pass like it's nothing and you'll have your research done. 

  My main complaint with the game is that the story is incomplete and it's not anyone except Konami's fault. I will never understand why they kicked Kojima off the project before he could even finish it. Despite this the game still feels complete and polished when it comes to everything else besides the stroy. Some hardcore MGS fans don't like this game because of this story issue. But I don't hold it against the game. I hold it against Konami. 

  The graphics are great. Not mind blowing or anything. But very good. The PC port quality is also pretty good. I run the game fine with my old fx 6300 still in my pc. 

  One thing the game does the best over anything else is it's music. Kojima's musical taste is embedded within this game  very deep. Every song sounds like it would come off of a mixtape from the 80s. Kojima is well versed in 80s music and it shows here. 

  Metal Gear fan or not I urge you to play this game. There is enough here to please anyone who enjoys stealth games. And since you can now get this game with all it's DLC and with Ground Zeros for 40$ I see no excuse to not pick this up. It's 100% worth every penny of that 40$.",True

"Overall, I liked it. But there are a lot of little things that bring this down a tad.

The performance isn't great like other reviews suggest. If you focus on the main quest, it's kinda short. It gets too easy near the end- the final boss fight was a huge letdown, as it was over in three keypresses. There's only one boss, when Human Revolution had many more. There's weird glitches. Some questions are left horribly open (looking at you, ""the mystery augs"") The story isn't as interesting as it could be. There's only one hub world. Horrifying loadtimes.

But, it still has far more major positives, that, I feel, outweigh the negatives. Prauge looks great- so it's ok you spend so much time there. The world is interesting, well detailed, and an absolute joy to explore. A certain complex almost feels like a full hub world. If you go out of your way to find sidequests, the game feels much, much more complete. A few of them had twists making me go ""wuh?"" in a good way. The gameplay is great, even if it gets too easy. The final quest excluding the boss battle is great fun. I like some characters. There's a crazy cat lady with cat pictures all over her walls, and I really liked some of the pictures she had up there, like the dancing cat one. I wouldn't hang it up, personally, but I think it's good for a giggle. The sidequests that link with Human Revolution are really cool.

Mankind Divided is flawed. But it still manages to be a good game.",True

I know its still new and it is a great game and I am sure it will only get better., PVP will be bad unless you build a playerbase with ongoing RPG elements. open world, Mobs, loot and trading to add an aspect of unique and rewarding. because there are just not enough shooter players on VR to make the games entertainment rely on players.",True
"I played Borderlands way back in the day when my brother first got it... *cough* free *cough* and I wasn't really that excited. He was though. So he started playing it and I always sat beside him waiting for my turn to use the computer, we had a rule where every 2 hours we switch and because I had nothing to do, and yes no homework either mom, I used to wait and watch him play. I was very into Call of Duty so it was hard for me to try out new games. However, as my brother progressed through the game, I started liking the game myself so I gave it a try. I mean you can tell the rest is history by the fact that i'm writing a review for BL2 in 2017. 

This game is my all-time favourite game and I can not wait for Borderlands 3 or whatever they're going to name it. I already played BL2 on XB1 but I just can't help it and bought it for PC too.

"Overall I believe this game is great, but can use a lot of improvement. I would love to see some aquatic speciemens in this game, and i agree with many others that these maps are far too small to truely get a full experience of maintaining a park. The changing of the DNA is a great idea but it feels cut short in the final product, needs much more options for customization of the Dino DNA strands. Along with more customization of the park itself. Many people have already compared this game to Operation Genesis, which it greatly feels like, but if the goal was to be better than that, it again fell short. Yes, the graphics on these dinosaurs looks amazing, but the AI needs to be greater than a game made 15 years ago, and you should be able to add objects like benches, fountains, stands, etc. I will continue to enjoy this game but me, along with much of the community, would love to see this game peak to its full potential. I greatly hope that the developers will continue to improve this game.",True

I remember the first game was an exciting mystery adventure. With some of the worst gunplay and ladder climbing ever. The gameplay issues with the first game was why I brought this source remake. Sadly even this version of the game is just way to dated looking to get into anymore. I might check out Black Mesa for sure.,False

"I was nervous about a alpha (i.e. paying for unfinished (possibly never finished) work but after watching a few weeks of SplatterCat play this I almost couldn't resist as it scratches my cold isolation itch. I used to wander off where ever I could on nights when it was -64 Celsius and revel in the feeling the world had died.

I've not even been able to make it 2 days yet but love wandering around. There is something interesting about exploring and managing time and condition that doesn't seem to screw things up. I'm sure this is a tricky balance that could make play very discouraging if done wrong.

I know at present I wish they would add a ""free play"" mode where in you can set the time of day and weather and ""freeze"" it. This means hours of wandering under the beautiful night sky, sitting in the forest look out during a beautiful blizzard, trekking through a morning fog...",True

"If youre really into tactical shooters, or millsim.
Then this is the game for you.
Everything from the weapons to the tactical decisions you will make with your team.
NOTE: would only highly recommend this game to people with friends, hard to play alone with randoms but still fun.

PROS: customization, real world accuracy, realism/milsim presentation, the WEAPONS
CONS: hard to handle the controls if you're cherry, lacks in-depth customization, had an issue with bullets registering when putting rounds between opfor eyes at 5m lol, requires you to actively communicate with your team (play with your friends)",True

"A faithful port of the tabletop card game, that doesn't do very much to elivate it. 

If you have the opportunity to pick up the physical version of this card game and play it with friends I would recommend that version over this one. You'll have more fun. 

In terms of stability, I experienced one crash the first time I played but it has run reliably well since then. 

My main gripe with this port is that it's a bit bland. There's no real reason to buy this version of the game unless you really can't find friends to play it with in person. There's only one song that loops over and over again. The sound effects are suitable to the style, but hardly inspired. Even on the fastest setting, combat takes just a bit longer than it should. Adding a pause button, and speeding up combat would easily fix this issue. 

It would have been nice to see them throw in some extra gameplay modes to make this version feel unique. Bundling in the DLC would have also made it more worth while. It feels like getting nickle and dimed for a few extra features. 

Boss Monster is a fun game, that is equal parts skill and luck, but I doubt this port is going to be on anyone's top 10 list.",True

I guess it's good at what it does and it all looks fairly pretty but it's just not for me.
The tutorial doesn't really give enough explantion and yet still somehow overloads you with too much that doesn't make sense until you just try and get on with playing. The problem is then that as you progress and need the info again there's no in game help system for referral and then either blindly click away in hope you're doing it right or come out of the game to search.

"This game is incredibly addicting, versatile, fresh and most importantly, fun. The community is great and the devs keep up with new content.

I bought a 4 pack of this game to play with my kids and my best friend, and yet we only have one PC in my house. The rest of the computers are Macs. This means that we cannot all play at the same time. I assumed with such a popular and long standing game as this, that it would be a no brainer that it would be OSX compatible.

"Oh hey, they gave one of the best parts of the Witcher 3 a standalone game!

What this boils down to is if you liked Gwent, odds are you will like this game. If you didn't, stay far, far away.

I will say that the game gets a little too easy and resources are a little too plentiful towards the end of the game; I kind of wish I had played on the hardest difficulty once I adjusted to the changes they made. (Spy spam is no longer God.)

Story is pretty solid; Queen Meve is an excellent protagonist, and you can feel that most of the other characters seem like they have their own motivations and goals. There are also some difficult choices to make, although I kind of hated the Morale system pushing you one way or the other. I mean, I understand that your army's morale would be important realistically, but all it serves to do in practice is gently push you away from certain choices because you MIGHT have to go into the next battle with weaker cards. (Although half the time there's a shrine available to get your morale back up easily.)

This game isn't perfect, but by God I lapped it up. When the game hits its stride, I found myself enjoying it more than the Witcher 3, because you feel like a bigger part of the world as a major figure like Queen Meve, rather than a wanderer like Geralt.",True

"[b]Why I recommend this game[/b]
I have really liked playing this game, its cheap (£6.99), there is a ridiculous amount of content, there is a huge map and I really enjoy the combat. If you like open-world style games or MMORPGs then you will likely enjoy this game!

[b]XignCode Anti Cheat[/b]
As for the XingCode Anti Cheat ""RootKit"", I really haven't found anything conclusive to say that it is doing anything malicious on my computer, only reviews saying that it does. Please leave a comment with a link or some information if you find otherwise as it does interest me still.

"Well, everyone's reviews are about the crash on start up. Yet no one has noted how quick the patch came out right after the game launched? Excellent work on the launch patch to get us exploring.

After 2 hours and only getting to my second planet the exploration seems like it would go on forever going from alien to alien.

The games mission? To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before! That's exactly what this game is and i really enjoyed it.

The running and sprinting could really use a overhaul asap as you sprint really slow and stamina runs out in seconds. This may be more life like but given the vastness of exploration why don't we have unlimited sprint?

The visuals can be breathtaking and on the same note the rendering can be dreadful, my second planet upon entering the atmosphere i was blown away i flew round a mountain ridge and seen a second planet so close it was as if you could build a bridge to get there.

I wouldn't stress too much about the 3 word negative reviews. Buyer beware this is not an action packed alien shooter, think Star Trek not Star Wars.

I'd really like to see how the dev's go forward with this, so far so good!!",True
"I bought this in the sale thinking It'll probably not be too good? Boy what a surprise, brilliant fun and addictive. Graphics are great, gun play is superb, especially the 2-handed implementation. Yes, the voice acting is as cheesy as cheddar, but it fits the game. There are a few irritations, not being able to change you weapon loadout being one, so many times you really needed different styles of weapons in a mission, a shotgun to clear zombies but then a sniper to pick off soldiers for instance. You don't know what enemies you're going to come up against and more than once I found myself facing a hoard of Z's with a sniper rifle. All in all the most fun VR game I've played so far.",True
"As of this moment, ATLAS has a lot that needs to be done with it to make it a true Pirate MMO Survival Game ETC.
For one! There is no Singleplayer atm, However I'm aware thats being changed atm, second if you want to play on official servers be warned, there are bigger companies (Some Hacker/Zerg Groups) that wil just wipe you off the face of the Earth before you even build a house let alone a raft, that was my experience. Third of all if you are a small company of 3-4 people you will be working your butt off to keep a hold of your claimed land, the hourly gold consumption for holding land is high to a point where honestly, just squat on the land and hope no one claims your home.

Do I Recommend this game as is... No, however! When Singleplayer is introduced I would recommend the game and that I know is a redeeming quality that is bringing people back, so one thing I would suggest to the team (Which is in planning), make it so people can host games from their comp like Lan etc.

Other then that only gripes I have is the obvious that the Game is pretty much a port from ARK, however I say that, but in reality I think we could say, this might be what happened after ARK finished up in EXTINCTION who knows ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.",True

"----------------------------------------------------------
First of all I strongly recommend this game for anyone. Only buy the game on sale of course, it is fair at 65-85% minimum off the main price. Also in short I'd give this game an 8.2 out of 10 if you have this game please add me as a freind so we can compete at each others scores :)

PROS: 
-Very interesting and entertaining physics with the grappling hook and rockets
-The combat ai seems to me compared to the previous games JC1-JC3 to be SLIGHTLY better they are improving
-The graphics in certain places of the game are beautiful 
-The story is... Ok worth watching at least
-The explosions are great np here just as good as the previous games JC2-JC3.
-Able to compare scores to challenges and such in game with friends on steam is neat
-The Easter eggs are great and worth exploring the world to find 

CONS:
-Rico.. Bring Rico from JC2 back :)
-You 100% need a well built gaming PC to enjoy this game ignore peoples reviews if all they have to say is it crashes there computer that is most likely there hardware not the game software..
-There are pretty much no more collectables to explore for..! :(
-The ambient ai in the games world is.. Boring most often
-Not even close to enough active ai for detail in the world like vehicles, pedestrians, and animals
-The selection of guns/weapons look like toys for a child
-Dummed down weapon selection literally 1 or 2 cool guns..
-Removed one handed weapons really..?
-The driving and flying mechanics physics what have you, are AWFUL HORRIBLE NOT EXEPABLE AS A GAMER LOL. Do not drive or fly anything in game to avoid frustration..
-Where is the weather? Always sunny is nice in reality but video games.. I want to see the rain/bad weather in detail often in games like this
-The water is unbelievably terrible like omg the worst i have seen in any game which should be unacceptable and people should be fired for its design.. Please improve the water with future patches if possible..

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For anything in the future try to combine JC2/3 they were amazing games. I hope strongly that they continue with JC!! I recommend to add detail to the world like active ai, animals and small/big side missions also collectables for emersion. That in any game with an open world is essential for entertainment I am playing these games to be entertained so the more attempts the better lol. Also the weather and water need wayyy more detail like c'mon does that need to be sed? I see that this game is getting horrible reviews which is totally understandable for most of the explanations people provide. That being sed I like this game very much, I would not make such a review if I didn't enjoy the game. This game is definitely worth a play through no matter how bad the reviews get.",True

Pros:

-It's pretty
-It's fun
-It works like a dream on my rubbish intel 5500 graphics

Cons:

-the unit number grouping system
-can be hard to identify/select units on the map
-messing up one mission on the camoaign can ruin everything

The graphics are immersive and the music is jaunty (although it drives my bf nuts.)  
It is easy to get started but as your paradise grows, it often becomes unwieldly. The level of intimate control you have is perfect if you're a little OCD. Sometimes it's a little too easy, although I am totally stuck on the last level.

"This is gonna be one of my few serious reviews.

To be honest, I dont see why everyone's complaining. Like I get it that the DLC is hella pricey, but to be honest, Overkill has spent A LOT of time working on just the base game, let alone the DLC.

Yes, I do agree that the DLC and game could use a little nerfing in price, but besides that, it's a simply great and enjoyable game.

Do I recommend this game?

Do I recommend invisible riot squads, ridiculous waves of SWAT, tons of guns and modifications to them, traits, masks, perks, SOON TO BE (hopefully) safehouse customization, hackers that boost you to the next tier, 1 hit kill throwing cards, golden ak47s, and a lot more?

"1.  I played the ORIGINAL RELEASE, not the Collector's Edition, ""CE"".  I beat it three times in total and loved it for all of its glitches and quirks

  2.  If you like class building and mob grinding with an interesting plot and story, you may like this game! 

  3.  I have almost beat the Steam Edition, 2/3rds of the way. My wife and I have completed all of our guild quests and I went with an Urgoth: Adept-Mage-Warlock-Monk-Necromancer.  She went with a Female Elf: Mage-Adept-Enchantress-Celestial-Stargazer.  We just got to the Vale of Ruin with about 6 hours worth of game-play.  (Yes, I have played this game through a few times already.  This is the first one as a multiplayer game.  Hence the 70 hours of total game-play.)

  4.  It is a good game, it is just different but I still think it is for the best, if they changed the inventory and equipment issues, most people would be happy as a clam with this.  For those that played CE, I am sorry, but I am ecstatic about this edition and it makes me want to try out CE now.   Maybe they can get rights to the various versions, edit out the glitches, obviously, and then make it an option to ""launch as"" and you can select which version you would like! 

  5. There were so many issues with the original and this simplifies and streamlines it.  I feel that they took out most of the hardships that the original punished you with.  The original would let you get into dungeons that required items that you had to have had PRIOR to entering the dungeon to ever get out.  It also had no map and a whole host of other issues with the game.  I have not had to restart to an earlier save at any point in this game.  

  TLDR;  If you like your Collector's Edition the way it is, and still own it, do not get this edition.  If you are open to some changes and you do not have any version of Dungeon Lords or just the original, you may want this!  It took time getting used to, but I have accepted the changes and they flow more naturally.



  LASTLY,  hats off to the developer's of this edition.  This game was riddled with more holes than swiss cheese being shot by firing squad. I hope they take the reviews and adjust a few things.  I just hope we have a game like this again someday.  So far I am loving Path of Exile.",True
"Game looks nice graphically and controls pretty well, but that's about all the positives I have for it. It's the same old hide from enemies you can't defend yourself from, as you'd expect, in it's most basic form. They see you, you hide, they leave, you come out of hiding, rinse and repeat. With that said, a majority of encounters favour running through enemies instead of trying to sneak around them, which I sort of prefer over sneaking, but it kills the fear factor much more quickly. By the end of the game it's chase sequence after chase sequence, several in a row, delivering the coup de grâce to any final possibility of being scared. There is also a lot of trial and error as many of the locations you are supposed to escape through require you to find tiny holes to crawl under or check several locked doors throwing you off, all while being pursued by potentially several enemies at once. The game had me a little nervous at the beginning, but about 20% of the way in the game couldn't coax the slightest reaction out of me. It began to feel like a chore of holding down Shift and W that I just wanted to end.

The environments were also incredibly repetitive, which doesn't help when the gameplay is already repetitive enough. You will encounter nothing but crude wooden structures over and over again, except for the segments and flashbacks taking place in Blake's (the main character's) old school. Everything outside the school segments just sort of blended together and, while some views were impressive from a distance, actually getting up close to them reminded you that they were the exact same as every other building or set of buildings in the game.

The story didn't do much for me either. I was very interested in the religious setting, only to be sorely disappointed when the cult was cartoonishly evil, ranging from deeds such as torture, sexual abuse and child murder. And boy did they want to drive home that bit about child murder. I was particularly looking forward to meeting Knoth, the man behind it all, [spoiler] only for him to actually make a physical appearence twice throughout the entire game, both during scripted sequences. The first is simply him taking part in interrogating someone and the second has Blake wake up from blacking out to be met with Knoth sitting on a pew talking about how he has killed his people before finally slitting his throat. He is never encountered as an enemy or a threat. [/spoiler] The sub-plot involving events during Blake's school days also seemed incredibly unnecessary and I don't actually understand why it was there. Surely they could have used the time and effort to add more to the story that was actually happening? 

Also I feel that the game was too short for the asking price, as I was able to finish it in under 7 hours, probably a little over 6 if you exclude the moments where I died several times trying to find the correct tiny hole to crawl under.


TL;DR
I stopped paying full attention to the story after a while so please take my opinions on it with a grain of salt, but the gameplay is repetitive, favours running away far too much, contains too many chase sequences and trail and error moments and the environments are fairly bland and uninspired. You're probably better off just watching this one on YouTube or waiting for a considerable price drop during a sale.",False

"Play this game. I never played Half-Life 1 (original or Source), so I came into Black Mesa hoping for something that measured up to Half-Life 2. I was not disappointed. 

I played the first half of the game when it was initially released years ago, so I was looking forward to finally getting to see Xen (I hadn't really paid attention to any of the promotional material). I replayed the front half of the game first, both because it's absolutely worth it and because I wanted to see what additional tweaks had been made. Tonight, I finally entered the portal, and all I can say is WOW. Xen is breathtaking.",True

"Finally got around to playing this and I am so happy I did. Huge fan of OG LucasArts Point-and-Click adventures and their sense of humor, this game was 100% the closest I have come to capturing that same feeling I got back in the day. Great WEIRD characters, great art, very funny writing. Puzzles not too difficult even on hardest settings. All the strange content hidden within the game made it a really wonderful experience, dog tutorial, and mutant dating sim, as well as the ending sequence(s) really stand out risks that other games wouldn't take and gaming is worse because of. This game brought us back to the weird place where we all belong.",True

"Doesn't support controllers or rebinding.

If you're hoping like me for a VR racing game with good controller support I'd give this one a pass. The only controller that appears to be natively supported is the original Xbox 360 controller. No prospect of anything else getting official support as the game appears to be abandoned by the developers.

Shame really as it looked nice and was hoping for some fun gameplay in VR using a joystick.

(And before the comments start, yes I know you can rebind other controllers using x360ce, however you shouldn't have to and it's clunky. I don't care to go to that level of time investment anymore just to get something playing as I intended).",False

A beautiful game... But hackers can even damage your computer.. Also moddlers and hackers are now 60% of the GTA 5 online game world.. making regular gamers impossible to play.

When I first heard about this game I thought it would be like any other puzzle game; it would start with a few fun levels then quickly descend into frustrating torture but how wrong was I? This game is amazing! The game has been very well play tested and the difficulty curve is perfect so the puzzles remain at just the right level to be challenging and satisfying. Like most other Valve games it is very well polished with great attention to detail. Despite it being a puzzle game it has a great plot and probably the best gaming antagonist. Stop procrastinating and get this game now.,True

"Well, I did like the character creation system, graphics are nice, fighting is really engaging and rewarding at most times but as a whole is a bit dull. Like playing an MMORPG on a dead-out server.

You get thrown right into the plot without a decent explanation who are you, what is going on, why do you do what you are doing, why should you care etc., and after being granted some ""epic destiny powers"", at the very beginning for loosing to a dragon, suddenly the whole world knows who you are; hell, they've even built special derp guilds for you in every city with mindless peons ready to serve just you (what?).

Another thing: the number of tedious side missions is too overwhelming. Most times I had no idea what I was doing or why for that matter. There is an actual side mission where you are supposed to chase a defenceless little boy through rooftops, to make his parents agree to sell their home to some rich douche-bag. You are the saviour of the world, the chosen one, DARK ARISEN, and they give you... this. Really?

- Hey, mate, what's the point to this game?
- Dunno, just keep hitting those mobes until your armour looks epic.
- Cool.

This would probably work in an actual MMORPG, but in a single player I just don't feel it.

So if your life long dream was to play a decent MMORPG but alone, sad and confused this game is for you.

If you came for a good plot, that keeps you hooked, main character that you 'feel', side characters that you care about, side missions that are immersive and fun to do: avoid at all cost. Buy a Witcher III.",False

"I'm a bit disappointed I didn't like this game, especially considering I seem to be an anomaly here. To start, I didn't find the cases very engaging. I often put up with weak beginnings just in case it pays off -- sometimes it does -- but sadly I didn't really want to put up with this one. Cases were quite short and didn't seem connected -- which is fine in its own right, but just not for me. It wasn't helped by the fact that this game thinks it's a lot funnier than it is (for me, anyway). Over-saturated with attempts to extract a laugh when, really, not everything needs to be a punchline. 

There is a lot to like though. It has lovely visuals and the music was very good indeed. And, TO BE PERFECTLY FAIR, playing the game actually hurt my eyes  -- I don't know what it might have been, but playing it always made my eyes sore and that could well have been a reason I didn't want to keep going.

"It's old, but it's not too bad for an old game.  It does have its potential problems, and it's worth warning folks in this review.

First off, this is not a game for little kids.  Of course, people get shot, and it's violent; most players have seen some of that.  However, it is possible to actually scalp dead people fairly early on in the game; I'm not yet sure what exactly this accomplishes, other than to let people indulge in a rather gruesome practice.  I wasn't too keen on some of the racist language used, but I suppose it's no worse than a Quentin Tarantino movie.  There is some nudity--so far, just boobs--and plenty of references to sex (the word ""poke"" is used).  I've barely made progress into the game as of this writing, so I suppose I'll be seeing more PG-13- and R-rated content soon enough.

Complaints about the controls seem justified.  I had to turn down the mouse sensitivity AND dial back the DPI on my mouse just to get the mouse response into a manageable response level.  Prior to that, I was probably spinning the character through 1080s with any short movement.  I changed the buttons to be closer to what I'm used to with older games I've played, but even then, it could get confusing sometimes.  Some of the things I was supposed to be able to do simply did not work at all; other things didn't make sense from what the game was telling me, so I had to look up a walkthrough or two in order to figure out the correct way to do them.

The gameplay and story seem engaging.  It's always amazing to see what game developers did to get around limitations of rendering power over the last two decades, just to offer anything close to an immersive experience.  Some old games hold up better than many new ones, actually!  These folks did a decent job, so far as I can see.  I'm going to try to finish it when I have time.

"I guess I can give it a hesitant thumbs up. 

You are a raccoon who gets to drop magic holes and terrorize a happy little village in the search for prizes. It's the same whimsical middle finger attitude that makes ""Untitled Goose Game"" so endearing. The story is a bit silly and the art is adorable, but the actual puzzle aspect of the game is fairly limited. If you're looking for a serious brain burner, move on along to ""Baba is You"" because this isn't it. Gameplay-wise, everything is straight forward enough to complete in 2-3 hours. The achievements come fast, so 100% the game shouldn't be a challenge for most players giving a good faith effort. 

The biggest plus is also the biggest negative: the casual nature of the game. I like games with heft, and this is clearly a game open to children. For the price, I'm a bit disappointed for the content bought. But, if you're happy with the idea of something that can be finished in an evening, go for it. The quirkiness (and wonderfully weird ""trashopedia"" entries) demonstrate it's a labor of love.

"Wow, I just noticed this game is free now. WTH? Ok first off ignore my play time. I have played and beat this game in offline mode a couple of times. It's a blast. And now that its free it should easily be one of the highest recommended F2P games on Steam. Its excellent, I actually bought it back when it came out.. I think it was either $14.99 or $19.99 I dont remember now. It was well worth the money then. My biggest complaint is that it doesnt have the most replayability. As its a campaign and the maps are the same and where the wolves come from is the same.. So after you play through it once or twice there isn't a lot to go back for. But trust me it is a great experience if you haven't played it. 

Its kind of a hybrid game. It's a puzzle/strategy/Third Person. You set different traps on a map during the day to prepare for packs of wolves and werewolves that will come at night. You have to be strategic in where you place your traps.. then when night comes the game goes to third person and lets you go fight the wolves as they come. If you dont place your traps right you'll get overwhelmed by the wolves and lose. Its been a long time since I played this game but that is the gist of it.

Small maps, fast gameplay! It has weapon, character and spell upgrades after you finish a map.  You get to choose your treasure's at the end of the maps too.  I would say for the price, especially on sale, this is a no-brainer for RPG fans.  Pick it up if you like Dwarves smashing heads! Yes, there are GIB's!!! lol :-)",True

"I've noticed a number of negative reviews for this game in steam about the issues regarding incomplete dlc's and game optimization but since I bought Dragon Age Origins in steam knowing that buying it off other platforms gives me credit of owning the Ultimate edition which by far was really the easy way to enjoy the game in full, but the thing is EA or something seems to Block the Ultimate version in my country for some reason, though it still can be played and enjoyed in steam and some guides in the community offer ways to acquire dlc's and optimize the game to avoid sudden crashes or random bugs in game cause there really is and alot! and some of them tend to break the experience, In my case at the arrival at Ostagar whilst exploring, The game suddenly crashed going from one area to another i've managed to fixed it by setting graphics settings on high instead of very high and x2 aliasing only since this is not FPS but a 3rd person game, Framerate for me was not such a big of a deal. 

My system is not considered gaming i play on laptop i7 7500U with a ddr3 940mx and on 900p res that is why i chose DOA since its an old gem of a game and framerate stays at stable 55 to 60 with occasional dips to 45 so its still a pleasant experience but that is just me can be different for someone else, overall i rate this game on steam 8/10 and still recommend it cause why not? It is Dragon age afterall other 2 points goes to hassle of trying to do tweaks to enjoy all dlc's and optimizations.. to add up try to verify game files before playing, worked for me anyways Thanks for reading all the way here and Enjoy the game cause i am :) oh btw disregard my playtime cause i've hundreds of hours on xbox

"I spawned, I was surrounded by 2 dudes wearing road signs for armor,  I was shot with a bow until I was bleeding out. They revived me, so I ran away. This was obviously what they wanted, as arrows then started to fly by my head. I was being used for target practice. I did not survive... 

Even so, I like my server, I understand these people. If its dark, they just kill you because they don't know what yer packin, during the day though I had a different guy visit my house and give me a buuuuuunch of stuff. 

It's hard to be mad or call someone a coward for killing a naked when that naked could pull a pipe shotty out from under his nutsack and one hit you. So my advice to new players is don't be a salty, just be ready to die at any moment. 

Oh and... 

THEY ADDED SMALL STASHES!!!! You can now BURY items in the ground and come back to them later to dig them up! I've always been a fan of The Tuna Bandits (if you miss legacy Rust, go watch their YT series) and how they lived out of hidden boxes among the rocks, rather than build a base that's a target for raiders. 

Now that I can just bury my cool stuff out and about, I'm using a hybrid system where I have a base for crafting that I just leave the door open for when I log off. 

I'm told the whipe for the server is on, is every first Friday of the month, so right now I'm mostly just learning the changes that have been made between now and Legacy. The dev's have been very active to say the least. There was a point when they switched from Legacy map to procedural maps when the maps felt really empty and boring, but the locations and the loot are back, and as such so is my interest. It's good to see Rust have the soul of Legacy again. 

I can't wait for this game to make it to console. If you want my opinion, this game is better than Ark (cheaper too), for a lot of reasons, but I'll list 2.

Frist, Rust has fucking incredible sunrises and sunsets, just check out the screenshot I took. Second, Ark has baby dinos that you MUST lose sleep for if playing on official servers and you want a good imprint. Losing sleep makes me a very unpleasant person...  and I cannot recommend a steady gaming experience of LOSING SLEEP to anyone.",True

- controler controls make the best of it. Still not good
- menus are convoluted and counter intuitive if you want to build fast and efficient
- cannot create real light sources (I know there are glowing blocks, but they only illuminate themselfs)
- sever lack of ""exotic"" but very common block types. (I understand thats most certenly not the scope of the game. still a bummer for me)
- camera in build mode 

DISCLAIMER: obvsly my opinions on controls and menus are my own. And I wont disagree that you most certenly could get quiet good results with training. But why train if I can jump in any other of this games and go full speed right away?

This game is great for kids and for adults who are not heavy into block building games on pc beforhand. However if you come from minecraft, starmade and so on the whole thing is more a gimmick than anything else.

"I don't like survival games in general, but damn this game got me hooked.

This game have engaging combat (a bit wonky at times), great world design, really cool armour and weapons, so many hidden things to find and discover. Both little lore pieces and recipes (weapon and armour) that are scattered around the world to be found, which is so far constantly just as thrilling as the first time.

Conan exiles offer the players so many ways to play the game. First off there are different servers, official and unofficial, which all offer different settings to the world like multipliers to gathering resources or how much you can carry, or if you lose your loot on death or not, and so much more. There are also mods, which one is basically a huge expansion to the game with almost twice as much of content as before, it's called ""Age of Calamitous"", check it out. 
The core game itself also offer so many possibilities of varied gameplay. There are different kinds of climates, which forces the player to adapt in various ways, like gear, food, drinks, but also in combat as the wild life is coherent with the climate, and some areas offer more thick skinned or rock type enemies, while some offer smaller and more agile enemies.
Where and how you build your base, if you want a base, also changes your playstyle, it also depends on the server and their rules and settings, I'm writing this without any PvP experience, since my current server just relax, even tho it's a conflict server. If you build a huge fort, you're safe and can have thralls boost your material growth and build time. You could also build a small base or several bases, be more on the run. Going completely without a base would also work, since you find gear from killing humans.

The last thing I wanna talk about is the world design. It's amazing. Every time I have been at one place, doesn't matter where it is, I recognize the area without looking at the map. That in itself is good design. But it also makes sense, it feels like it could be a real world. It's engaging and fun to run around and explore, it never gets dull so far. I keep finding cool things, both items and man made things, and just the natural areas have so much to offer and gets me in a state of awe at times.

Great game, would recommend, even if you don't like survival.",True

No special controller, no complicated techniques, you'll never have to press more than one button on each side of the controller at a time. It's a rhythm game you can just pick up and play, and I like that. Some of the songs are also nice and challenging, and it gets especially hard on... well, the hard difficulty, but it never gets frustratingly difficult.

The music is also very good. I've never paid TOO much attention to the music in previous Senran Kagura titles, but seeing how this one's a rhythm game, the music's kind of important, and fortunately they nailed it. This game features an unexpectedly wide variety of genres, from the obvious ones such as gagaku (being a game about ninjas) and rock (being a rhythm game), to ones you don't commonly hear in rhythm games, such as funk, hip hop, and even salsa. Many songs actually transition from one genre to another as they go. For a game about anime boobies, it is surprisingly innovative.

But, no game is without its flaws, and I have plenty of criticisms to give as well.

The visuals are uncomfortable. For real. It's disturbing even for a Senran Kagura game. if you get good at the songs, you'd better get used to the sight of your opponent cooking while half-naked and crying. That's not even sexy, that's just sad. For god's sake, I just wanna grill!

There's also the issue of difficulty scaling. Like in many rhythm games, some songs are harder than others, and not meant for beginners to the game. But unlike in many rhythm games, all the songs are available right off the bat, with each song being associated with a specific character. The character/song selection screen has zero indication of how hard a given song is, and the story mode has a tendency to throw some of the hardest songs at you early on. If your favorite character's first opponent happens to be, say, Miyabi, or god forbid Rin, well... all I can say is good luck!

My last gripe, both in this review and in my actual experience playing the game, is just how repetitive it gets. Each character's story mode scenario has five songs, the first and last two of which are fixed and accompanied by cutscenes, while the second and third are randomly chosen songs with no cutscenes. This means, to clear all 22 characters' story mode scenarios, you will need to play 110 SONGS. And you'll have to play nearly twice that many if you're going for all the achievements. With only 22 songs to choose from, it quickly becomes a completionist's nightmare... or rather, a completionist's repetitive fever dream. It's unnecessary for story mode scenarios to be five songs long when it's clearly shown that three songs is more than enough to tell a complete story. The repetition isn't helped by the fact that even Arcade Mode has a fixed song order (the order depends on your difficulty selection and the faction your player character is in), making it difficult to mix things up.

But, for all these flaws, they don't take away too much from the main aspects that are most important to a rhythm game: The music and the gameplay. The game is a lot to deal with, but it is also a lot of fun if you're willing to put up with its shortcomings.",True

"There are some games that are genuinely addictive but, this is one of those games where you feel like it's not a time waste of nothingness. Sometimes I can just get so absorbed in Hexcells that I lose track of time. The ambient music, the blinding light of the screen can keep you glued to your seat for minutes deciphering some of these puzzles. After each puzzle you say ""one more won't take long"" then 2 more hours have passed. 

The logic of this game is wonderful something similar to that strange Windows game Minesweeper only no annoying little bombs that end the game when you hit it. Actually I would say it's a reverse Minesweeper and instead of bombs you've got blue dots. And every time you deduce a blue dot some piano keys play in the background. Sometimes I imagine Hexcells is what happens when your brain is on drugs. I'm not quite sure which drugs yet but it leaves you with a good feeling afterward so take your pick. 

The only issue I have with the game is the blinding white light that entrances you. It would be nice to have the option of a dark screen. It was implemented on the game Squarecells so I don't see why the developer couldn't add the same function to this one. Also LOVE the random puzzle generator. It breaks up the monotony of the regular levels, which are a challenge unto themselves.",True

"It is a wonderful horror game. Based on Slender: eight pages, this game enhances everything include visual presentation, sound effect, special effect...etc. If you like eight pages, don't miss this one.

Attention: This game adopts JUMP SCARE technique heavily, if you can't accept, then skip this one. 

Players in this game have to achieve certain goal, collect eight pages for example, in dark environment, and the freaking Slender Man will WARPS around to hunt you. When you wander in dark forest, you don't know when it will appear, all you can do is complete the goal as fast as possible and pray, you will be nervous all the time. When you see it, the screen will distort with freaking sound, a creepy man with no face, unusually slender body that definitely not a human, stand still in darkness, it will freak you out, and you can't look at it too longer or stand still too, run for your life, otherwise it will capture you. The tension, the uncertainty, the pressure to complete goal under creepy atmosphere, all of these make terrifying experiences outstanding, it works perfectly to scare people.

The more you approaching the goal, Slender Man will warps more close to you and more frequent, you will be capture easily one step before achieving the goal, you may retry many times to walkthrough a episode, it somewhat difficult and it's on purpose, ""How long you can last"" is the core intention for this game, but sometime it may cause frustration, repetitive gameplay due to diffculty may ruin your terrifying experience, I suggest play it on easy if you are casual player or want to keep terrifying experience FRESHLY.",True

"The idea of rocket-powered cars flipping through the air in Thunderdome-esque matches of cage-soccer sounds like the incoherent ramblings of a madman, but it turns out to be just crazy enough to work. Psyonix’s Rocket League, the follow up to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars, finds dumb fun in pulling turbocharge-assisted front flips in an ice cream truck, and the white-knuckle strategy in working with your team to control the giant ball on offense and defense. The fast and fluid absurdity of Rocket League fuses into one hell of a good time, despite servers that rarely work perfectly.

The main mode puts two teams of three in visually diverse but performance-identical vehicles (though 1v1, 2v2, and 4v4 variants exist) as they race up and down the pitch chasing the league’s oversized equivalent of a soccer ball. The great thing is, you don’t need to know anything about driving games or soccer to play. The rules are simple: drive really fast around bright, glossy, neon colored arenas and do fancy tricks while trying to smash an endlessly ricocheting ball into a deceptively tight space.

The heart of Rocket League lives in that feeling of unrestricted movement. It’s thanks in large part to the use of what I would call “physics plus,” where the laws of gravity and momentum get a colorful overhaul to allow for driving on the walls and ceiling, and ridiculous mid-air direction changes that would liquefy the driver in the real world. But its fantastic movement is so arcadey and satisfying that I often have to remind myself to pump the brakes or lay off the tricks when a simple nudge or bump will do.

And those tricks are the first surface-scratching glimpse at Rocket League’s layer of strategy under the ostensibly chaotic mashing of metal. Tapping your jump button puts you in the air, where tapping it again with a direction held performs a somersault, barrel roll, or bicycle kick. It might sound simple – and really, it is – but timing a strike to connect with a speeding ball, and controlling the direction you send it sailing, down to precise angles, takes some skill. There are real, potent levels of satisfaction to be tapped when you see a teammate lining up a shot from the corner and read the situation, slamming on the brakes to nudge the “pass” into the goal with a perfectly timed barrel roll. It’s electric.

Outside of the frenzied and intoxicating gameplay, Rocket League has scant few features to flesh out the experience. The player-progression system – where winning matches, performing in-game feats, or doing anything really, earns you experience – unlocks a small stable of goofy cars or cosmetic decals and accessories.

It’s fun to drive a truck wearing a sombrero, sure, but because there’s little or no mechanical difference between the dozen or so sportsters, trucks, exotics, a few concept models and at least one ice cream truck (exclusive to PS4 players), there’s no actual sense of progression that changes how you play a match. And while that’s all perfectly justifiable in the name of a level multiplayer playing field, I would have loved to see each car carry the strengths and weaknesses implied by their real-world counterparts: sport cars as speedy but hard-to-handle strikers, trucks and vans as slower but stronger defenders, and the balanced but all-purpose roamers somewhere in between. It seems like a missed opportunity to add a more meaningful connection to your cars in the garage, especially when making a squad to play through an entire season.

But there is a separate progression arc found in learning to use the surprising mechanical depth of Rocket League’s many controls and flighty physics. Whether that arc takes you through online competitive or ranked matches, easy-going exhibitions, up to four-player local cooperative play on split-screen, or all 36 weeks of a fully expanded season mode, the Rocket League experience is always about getting into the next throttle-pumping match.

And while there are leaderboards to track your statistics and global prowess, Rocket League servers struggle to support the influx of PlayStation 4 and PC players hunting for same and cross-platform matchmaking bouts, rendering most of Rocket League’s online features – including the online party system – spotty at best. Fortunately, the AI is formidable on either difficulty setting above Rookie, both as teammates and opponents, so Rocket League doesn’t lose much in a completely offline existence, which is good, because its online suite is largely unreliable.

MY OPINION

Rocket League is a rare example where the execution of a simple, absurd idea is so strong and so engaging that it doesn’t need a ton of extra features around it. The rush of ripping across the pitch at full turbo to deny a shot on goal with a clutch bicycle-kick is enough to bring me back time and time again for just “one more match,” even without meaningful progression systems. Rocket League is a great, goofy, easy to learn and difficult to master action-sports game which demands that you grab a few friends and play a few rounds.",True

"This game guarantee the player to have fun either solo or coop. The story in the game is pretty awesome, from sad to comedy storyline, every story is perfect. The player would have plenty much to do by grinding to find that weapon that they like. The player can also challenge themself by playing much more harder game mode (need DLC if not mistaken) OP1 - OP8, to see either they can do it or not. The player got a good choicce of playable character which most of them got a unique skill and skins. All the characters (including DLC) are really good, they even got their own story line (which can be heard from the audio log).

"Holy hell if that isnt a tough game. The initial levels took me about 30 minutes to go through but hard mode try an hour and a half. 

So here's my feelings on the game in 3 catagories...

Gameplay:
The gameplay is fun and easy to grasp, each level offers a new challange. The early levels are easy but as I got to the last 5 it took a few deaths to formulate a strategy. The gravity gun is a very interesting mechanic, left click fires a blue ball that sucks things in and the right click was an orange ball that pushed things away. I like the idea and would love to see the same concept done in a 3d environment. Overall, the mechanics were smooth and no glitches occured.

Graphics:
Not really an important part of this game as I'd have been just as happy with 8bit. The graphics are smooth and made for 1080p screens. The animations are basic with very few frames but this isnt really a con to the game. Really I think the artwork done for this game fit the theme and looked rather good for what it is.

Sound:
The music for this game is rather nice, one moment its calm and relaxing and then in some levels the music speeds up a bit for escape levels. One nice thing I'd like to note is that the sound enemies make when they bounce off of walls is there but not distracting. That I believe is very important and I'm very happy that they were careful about the volume of that ting noise they make.

Overall I can definately recomend this game to casual and hardcore gamers alike. 10/10",True

"I'd jumped blindly into a portal, bouncing across the universe to a star system who-knows-where.  The planet I'd ended up on was swarming with too many Sentinels for comfort, and its moon was a desolate frozen husk whose howling blizzards could drain my environmental protection systems in less than two minutes flat.  Searching for another in the planet where I could catch my breath and regroup, I spotted one nearby that my ship's scanner tagged as a 'Verdant Planet'.  ""Okay,"" I thought.  ""Sounds pleasant enough.""

The planet turned out to be covered in mountains, such that I had to make liberal use of my jetpack to traverse it.  Other than that, it was an entirely pleasant place.  I scanned some of the local flora and fauna, then tagged a nearby building for investigation.

That was when the message flashed up on my HUD.

"I really wanted to give this game a positive review, however there a lot of things that irritated me and unfortunately since our only option is a binary voting system, it is a No from me. 

+First, game's mechanics and all other elements actually kind of smart and makes you immersed on the world and characters. 
+I liked the detailed character explanations and how they look. Each character is well written. Wonderful job there.
+Choices matter.
+Game looks great even though the engine is kind of problematic.
+Till Episode 3, story and all mystery elements the game offer is amazing. You can literally forget Episode 4 and 5 because they nullify the last episodes and take a completely different approach storywise.
- There are a lot of backtracking in the game and that's not an exaggeration, you literally run in the same places all over again. So after some point, it becomes an artificial longevity for the game.
- Conversations are sooooooo long and UI is so clunky that it becomes a chore to talk with the characters. There is no skip button, so you're basically f'ed.
- I wanted it to end as quickly as possible at the end because of the puzzles. Oh my the puzzles. I think this is the most irritating thing for me that the game has to offer. There are times that you have to literally spend 10-15 minutes or more to solve a problem by reading the same thing all over again and find out what's the correct decision. Did I mention that the UI is so clunky? Yes, it literally becomes a chore for you and especially on Episode 4 and 5 I skipped and Googled every puzzle so that I don't spend much time. You either need the skill for solving it or you literally need to read or analyze everything in the game to understand what you need to do.
-Last episode and the ending is incredibly rushed that I cannot even describe. You don't even know what happened to protagonist. It just ends, like that.

So, even if the idea is great, I think they streched it a lot and ultimately the game lost its appeal. Still would like to see their next game because the devs have a lot of potential and they will learn from the mistakes that they did with The Council.",False

You see where this is going? It never stops. Theres always something to improve. It    is   wonderful.

On top of that the Devs are pretty impressive.

"Don't get me wrong the game is solid already,  but even at this point early access,  the base game just doesn't feel very involving.  You start out in a game with a spawn point and are given lots of blueprints to activate then craft.  Where I get pretty annoyed and usually give up is the whole downward scrolling aspect of the game.  To reach the first 'layer' of a surface, you need to drop down,  which requires building stairs back up to the initial block of dirt you spawn in to presumably build your starting base.   

Getting back to the whole verticle scrolling aspect of the game.  Going up and and down all the time requires building lots of stairs and frequent use of your jetpack.  The problem is, it recharges extremely slowly,  resulting in a lot of time just waiting to use it.   Lighting is also trickier than in other survival games:  there's a few flareguns and torches to be placed,  but they all require using the crafting menu,  which is tedious. For example, to craft an item you need to select the materials you want to use first,  sometimes there's a huge list of materials you need and if you are missing one, you'll have to re-select all of them again if you want to try and craft again.   A lot of the time you'll find yourself in the dark trying to climb out of a pit of some sort, and hope you don't accidently fall further downwards to certain doom.

Speaking of tedious,  everything just feels tedious to me about the game.  Mining is about as exciting as watching blocks smoke from heat before turning into collectable ores.  Crafting requires dragging a blueprint to your inventory slots, selecting the slot,  holding left click to activate the blueprint,  then right clicking the inventory slot to remove the blueprint.  This is just a typical example of how something is done in this game and honestly I don't feel like any of it is as intuitive as it should be.   

Combat is also pretty sleepy.  You shoot enemies,  and they die.  There's no real weight to the combat and it's just not very gratifying.  

Overall tho, the game does feel solid as I say.  Personally I just fall asleep trying to figure something out,  but that's just me.  Many will find the game appealing because there is much to do and there's a lot of content,  so if the aforementioned things don't bug you, feel free to dive in.",True

"It's a decent game but needs polish. I like Fallen Enchantress Legendary Heroes or AOW3  much better but this game has a lot of potential. This is the first time I have given a thumbs up to a mobile port, yes it was a computer game first but then ported to mobile and now ported back.

PROS - Many different spells, items, styles of play. If you like this genre then you should think this is at least decent. The different races play very differently. I find the game to be pretty difficult which is usually nice. It has good replay value since most of the races are so different and there are endless spell/trait combos for your Lord. Heroes are nice and neat to get but the regular high end units are better until you can get your heroes all decked out in good gear. The heroes allso seem to have a wide variety of classes, skills and spells which is nice that they aren\'t just a few cookie cutter guys with different names. AD&D based spells and monsters.

CONS - It needs polish. Many little things like errors in the game manual, example is one trait that says it gives units a +25% exp bonus when in game it says +5%, some graphics need to be reworked, example the summon spirit spell summons a spirit that looks like it\'s a pencil outline with blue color added, The AI seems to cheat, example an AI lord can have many cities, armies etc much faster than possible even if you play the same Lord on the same settings and try it yourself, that shows on even the easiest settings. Lack of options - yes there are a zillion Lord setup options but the game world and oponents there are not so many and even though the devs are actively involved and fixing bugs etc. they consider the game fully complete and I don't think that it is. The planes options when starting a game, you can only pick a maximum of one of each plane, what if you wanted a game with 3 paradise and 3 negative planes to make it life vs. death kind of thing, it's not happening, no settings to make the neutrals more or less aggressive, world events more or less common, can\'t disable spell trading so the AI's can sit there and trade ack and forth with each other to far out do your research. There are many popups which is great but they need more detail and more of them. I click on some funky shrub on the map and it shows a figure and an up arrow, I have no idea what exactly that means and there\'s nothing anywhere explaining it. Do I need to build a town there or just have it in my borders? Borders don\'t expand. There is no campaign of any kind, it\'s a skirmish game only. No options that I can see for your camera, if you have 5 scouts set to auto the camera will zoom all over following each one, maybe I don\'t care what the scoucts are doing and I just want them clearing away the fog, No option for the camera speed, set 5 scouts to explore and you'll have a headache from the camera ripping around to follow them, that's even with fast movement turned off. No option to set unit behaviors, like scout for exp chests or scout for mana/gold and leave the exp chests, can't tell the scouts to auto interact when they find unguarded locations or to even always fight like an agressive mode.

So that's it. I think it\'s ok and I'll play it some more. I think that it could be a great game though with some more work. Even if they just polish up the little things and then do a DLC to add more options/content then it could be great. It is good enough that I can give it a thumbs up.",True

The core of it is fun and the finished product will likely be pretty decent game. I managed to play through all the content in the game in my ~3 hours playtime, including the startups, before my save game got corrupted and I lost all my progress.

The UI needs serious work, and is probably the single biggest problem with the game right now (besides lack of content). 95% of my time was spent clicking nodes together while 5% was spent actually solving problems. Despite the tedium of that, I did thoroughly enjoy it and I look forward to the full release.

"**Revision this review to thumbs up ONLY because Modding has made this game what it should have been at launch the below Review still stands IMHO if your only playing the base game its not worth your time if you were hoping for everything they promised in development. Oh and hey look they are adding mounts after launch when they stated at launch this was impossible to add which is why the dropped it from development prior to launch! Funcom only wants your money nuff said but the modding really does make this game worth your time** 

Once again Funcom is out for your wallet and not to actually produce a game that’s even remotely what you expect.

350+ hours on record the games been full of its bugs all throughout Early Access and Funcom declared they were listening to the consumers and fixing broken things as they went along. This was a complete pile of BS as now with what should be a polished and all bugs squashed from an early access program appear to be still there and some of this stem back from reports of over a year ago.

Small breakdown on what I have observed in what should be an AAA+ final release game and let’s ignore all the broken promises during development spin it whatever way they want to in their dev streams the consumer expected sorcery and mounts and they failed to deliver. this has been beaten to death in the past 3 months so i won’t bother here.

Graphical Issues: Arrow stuck in hand, invisible players / equipped items still exist it’s one of the oldest bugs in the development process of early access and whether they just couldn’t be bothered to fix it or are just incompetent to fix something with over a year of time to do so it still is in the full release.

New Combat system: locking on target / facing target 99% of the time this system fails it was reported when it came out on test live that if your hunting with a clan mate with no friendly fire or even only playing PVE hitting lock on target or face target most of the time faces your friend and not the NPC/Beast your trying to target its clunky and should have been simple to fix but nope still playing with friends and almost killing them when you’re actually swinging at a crock. Not to mention that all status effects ignore your friendly fire settings in the server so while your hit does no damage that bleed will most likely kill your friend.

New / Thralls - Follow mode: This came out a few months back and has been buggy since day one and has not improved into release. having a thrall follow you most of the time will result in death of the thrall unless you’re constantly babying him along to help him path most of the time the player just returns to the place he placed the thrall down to find it headless and loot able and dead. Bearer thralls the only use for them is to tame them and steal a back pack for +5 encumbrance they were supposed to have an increased inventory over other thralls never happened. most useless piece of code to implement and never fix should have left the new pack thralls with the modders.

I can go on there’s about 30+ notes of bugs and broken promises and hardware - video issues but there’s plenty of posts you can read about this. This review is for anyone who has not purchased this game yet DO NOT! if you can get it on some sale down the road its only worth about $5 - $10 USD as it currently sits as there’s indie titles out there that are more attentive to their user base and about bug fixing then this developer is. Its Funcom it’s about the cash grab and run and put out something that’s only at 70% polish and calling it good enough.

"Wow is this game addictive! The game mechanics are very simple but there's something about it that just makes you wanna keep playing, even if you're doing terribly (especially when first starting). There's three base difficulties and if you survive 60 seconds without hitting any obstacles, you'll unlock the hyper version of that level. That's where things really get crazy. The speed at which the obstacles zoom at you increases and if you're not in the zone, you're gonna die within seconds. Period.

This game still manages to be fun even when I'm getting massacred. How it does this, I don't know but know but it works. I was never one to be a high score whore but this...this is a different thing altogether. All I can think about is beating my old score. Best $3.00 I've ever spent.",True

"A game this small in scope that has grossed over $1 Million and has been in development for over 5 years should be complete. It's still not really. If it hadn't had a budget, maybe I could forgive that.

This game could be amazing, and it still breaks my heart a little that it has joined the long, long history of halfway finished sandbox games doomed to moulder in the graveyard of empty promises.

Like many games in the sandbox genre, this one leans very heavily on crowdsourced mods. Meaning a lot of very talented and committed people who are not paid have created the lion's share of the content for this game. And you will need that content for the game to feel complete. You will need a lot of it.

You must be comfortable with sifting through hundreds of mods, most of which are not worth playing, and many more that are skillfully made but designed to simply prolong and complicate the game rather than improve it. Then you have to be content to restart your world dozens of times as you tweak and adjust your mods. Finally, you have to be OK with debugging your world and figuring out what unpredictable interactions the mods have caused.

The part of the game where you build automation is clever and fun. But it lacks a lot of common sense human-centered design that you can only get from hours of mod curation. But a better UI should simply be part of the game I paid for.

[b]The Good[/b]
[list]
[*] Automation: It really is fun to set up automation systems, train systems, and logistics networks. You will need to use mods to make them feel complete or get some common-sense creature comforts, but the framework is there.
[*] Moddable: If it seems like I don't like mods, you've got me wrong. This game is easy and fun to mod.
[/list]

[b]The Bad[/b]
[list]
[*] Mods Aren't Optional: Mods are absolutely required to flesh out the game, placing a huge setup and maintenance cost on the player.
[*] Enemies: There's a tiny number (3?) of very samey and not very smart enemies, each of which appears in a number of sizes and slight variations. You will be sick of their tediously predictable attacks very quickly.
[*] Terrain Art: Mind-warpingly dull terrain in an artwork style that makes it hard to tell what's going on much of the time.
[*] UI: Do you love managing inventories? Is managing inventories your favorite game? Mine either.
[*] Character art: Your exactly one character figure stands at attention, rapidly sweeping his gaze back and forth for no reason. Forever.

"Sooooo addictive. In the original XCOM I used to think I was overly attached to my soldiers who survived more than 1 or 2 missions.

"Rating: 9/10

Have you ever replayed one of your treasured childhood 8-bit games, only to be disappointed? It felt so different in your memory... Well, Super Win The Game feels the exact opposite of that. In fact, SWTG is what old childhood games should have been in the first place. Don't know what I am talking about? Try its freeware prequel ""You Have To Win The Game"", that is, if you grew up playing games on an old CGA-monitor. Put it simply, it is PURE AWESOMENESS.

Pros
Level Design: this is probably what most reviewers will overlook, since the best level designs are the ones you don't even notice. The levels are just so complex and fun to explore, with its different themes and multiple secrets. And speaking of secrets, oh my, you will be served. I literally discover one every single time I load the game.

Mechanics / Physics: Also an overlooked aspect for the same reason mentioned above. It just feels good to play. And the more items you collect, the freer you become. Again, try YHTWTG if you want to know how it feels beforehand, it's the same home-made self-developed pro-level NERD engine.

Television Emulation: This one just completes the whole retro experience. It also has more options to experiment with than its predecessor. Although I recommend the default settings, which are the best in my opinion. Oh, if only we could apply it to other retro games on Steam...

Cons
The music: It can become really annoying and repetitive. Especially for the fact that more than half of the tracks just don't fit the area you are in. The best example would be the ice area. In most old games, the area is expressed musically by a certain mystery and some high-pitched ""icy"" notes. Think SMB3's ice level map or even Zeliard for PC gamers. On the other hand, the main tune (let's call it the ""black and white"" track) is really good and fits the mystery and loneliness of the whole game. The waterways, lair and lava area tunes also fit adequately. The rest just soon gets on your nerves. So it's up to you to keep the music on or not.
Length: I guess a speed-run could be done in less than two hour, though the first time you play, you will go back and forth, get lost, try to figure out what to do next, etc. I guess it took me about 7 hours of ""normal"" gameplay to beat. Then you can go back and look for all the secrets you missed the first time. Still, the downside of having an amazing game like this is that you will always want more of it.

Other observations
Weird messages/poems (black and white sequences): This one, well, I'm not sure what to think of it. Perhaps they are some kind of riddles I haven't figured out yet. The other possibility is that they are just the author's personal poetic thoughts, which add even more artistic value and mystery to the game.
Interaction: By this one, I mean that I feel there could have been more interactions with non-playable characters populating the cities and such. I guess the author wanted the player to feel a certain loneliness, but some Zelda-like sub-quests for example would have been fun.
Secrets: As I mentioned in the pros, there are secrets everywhere. The thing is, if you are a bit of a perfectionist and want to collect all the gems and items, you will end up wasting a lot of your time scrutinizing each screen (i.e. stick to walls and jump like an idiot) in hope of finding new invisible secret passages.

As you can probably see by the length of this review, I have just had A BLAST playing this game. I am now just wishing for some DLC of sort that could add quests, items, heck even an entire new level with some good chiptune music. A retro boxed version would be awesome too. Anyway, It is a MUST-BUY for all you nostalgic gamers, especially of the 8-bit generation.

"I've been a fan of this genre for a long time now.  The idea of platformer + roguelike has always been something that seemed to have the potential to be amazing.  Spelunky, thusly, should have been a great one for me, but I just couldnt get into it.  A seriously dull speedrun meta, among all sorts of other things, kept it feeling shallow and uninteresting to me.  Enter Caveblazers:  The game that is everything I had wanted Spelunky to be.... but with some seriously monstrous balance problems.  We'll get to those in a bit.

If you've seen Spelunky, you know the basics here:  Start at the top of each level and work your way down to the exit.  No time limit here though:  Where Spelunky obsessed over rushing, Caveblazers encourages actual exploration through it's sprawling levels.  And it gives you loads of incentives, as unlike Spelunky, Caveblazers will drown you in all sorts of items and things to find.  You're well rewarded for your efforts when it comes to exploration.

The items, actually, are one of the things that really stick out here.  You have a full equipment setup... you have a sword, a ranged weapon, a magic item (activated thing), and two rings (some things can give you extra ring slots).   There are about a squillion of each type of item, and choosing the correct ones for your build and the current situation is something that is very important here.  The way the game is, there isnt really any ""best"" setup.  And often, an item that is a good idea on one run may be a bad idea on the next.  It's up to you to manage your equipment properly and make the correct choices.  In addition to that, there are blessings, permanent passive effects that add further to your build.   All of these things take the exploration aspect of the game and make it really mean something.  Finding the right stuff for your character due to exploring and chopping your way through hordes of monsters is just outright satisfying here (particularly considering the Perks, which are effectively classes that you choose from before each run), and there's a bewildering array of things to find (and unlock).

Speaking of chopping through monsters, the combat is certainly noteworthy as well.  Melee combat consists of a 3-hit combo, with the last hit being a ""heavy"" attack that sometimes has special properties.  Ranged combat is done twin-stick style, except that it's stuck to an 8-way aiming system... not 360-degrees.  On paper, this sounds bad.  In practice, it actually works very well, and the entire game is setup around this.  Orcs, the most common enemy type, are also restricted to this aiming method.  And lastly, you have your magic items, which charge up over time and can be activated to produce powerful effects to help you in battle.  Combat as a whole is fast, visceral, chaotic, and soooooo much fun.  I daresay it's some of the best combat I've ever seen in the genre, regardless of what you're up against.  And you'll be up against quite alot of opposition.  Your enemies are many, swarming you at all times, and there are many types.  Orcs are the most common, though there are many types of Orcs, getting more and more dangerous as the game goes on.  Orcs have both swords and bows just like you do (some have even worse things), but they're particularly notable for their ability to traverse the level.  Just like you, they have the ability to wall jump (think Super Meatboy, that sort of wall jump), and thus the ability to climb upward to reach any part of the level.... and their advanced pathfinding AI means that they can do just that.  You are never safe from these guys, and they are absolutely everywhere.  In addition, there's all sorts of other crazy things out to get you, from flying skulls, to horrible, horrible poisonous bouncing slimes that can float in the air and throw the most annoying projectiles ever.   Enemy designs are very well done here, and well thought out.  They all  really add to the fun and excitement of the game's combat system.   And of course, there are gigantic bosses.... also very well done.   These guys feel properly epic (usually), and add alot of challenge.  

Lastly, there are lots of secrets to be found, and all sorts of things to unlock, such as outfits to customize your character with.  Some things unlock as you keep playing the game, others require that you fulfill special conditions.  There are also very special things called Relics to find.  Exactly five of them to get, and when you have them, you can choose to activate each one before starting a run, and they have a HUGE effect on the run, adding entire game mechanics to the mix.

But here is where we come to the problems I mentioned earlier:  The balance issues.   Lets get the big one out of the way:  The 5-Relic run.  Where, obviously, you activate all 5 relics at once, and attempt to get through the game.  I wont spoil the reason for doing this, but it is important.... however, it's a complete and utter disaster.  Possibly the worst balanced thing I've seen in the entire genre.  NOBODY likes doing this.  Nobody.  The fun drains out of the game, and chances are, so will your sanity.   The difficulty goes berserk, but not in a good way:  This will add boatloads of artificial difficulty to the game, and a seriously extreme reliance on RNG... not a good thing in a game that's clearly supposed to be about skill and decision making.  The entire experience just completely falls apart here.  The fact that there is a pretty big amount of content gated behind this (as you'd expect, since that's how these games always work) makes this extremely frustrating.  You'll die over... and over... and over.... and over, and most of the time, it WONT be fair.  There are assorted other balance issues in the game that really need a fix as well... I wont go into detail here, but you're probably going to know them when you meet them.  There's also some things that are just very strange design decisions, such as potions, which just plain dont fit the game at all, and can be extremely annoying. Quite alot of issues, yet the game just hasnt gotten much in the way of updates yet.   This means that the game has absolutely incredible potential... but it cannot meet it yet.

That, however, does not stop this one from being pretty darned incredible.  The fantastic, varied, and deep gameplay and high challenge constantly makes for that ""one more run"" feeling, even when it's being aggravating.  While the problems it has are unfortunate, it's still an absolute blast to play, and an absolute steal for the price.  As far as I'm concerned, this is a classic.",True

"I absolutely adore this game, even in its current state. The developers are extremely active with adding new features and listening to the community. The soundtrack is awesome. The ability to build a ship however you want is amazing. There's a lot to love about building a massive capital vessel that you completely designed yourself and seeing it finally come to fruition, rumbling ahead under its own power while three dozen guns annihilate anyone and anything that comes near it.

"Risk of rain 2 is single handedly the best indie rogue-like I have ever played, I still feel like i can keep playing this game even though I have basically completed every challenge. The gameplay is smooth and always changing. Sure the maps are always the same but thats not what keeps me coming back, its the items, the items are what makes or breaks you in this game. The infinite scaling of the difficulty and the items is so amazingly developed and the anticipation to see what item combo I can get set up is so much fun. Don't get me started on the soundtrack, the music is so gripping and it just drags you into the game more. The music enhances the experience tenfold in my opinion. The characters in this game are all very fun to play, from the average commando to the absolute psychotic acid dog, acrid. All of them are so fun to play with their unique playstyles and combos. You can sink many hours into this game and still probably not have completed all the challenges. With friends it's even better cause the chaos that multiple can cause is so enjoyable. The system requirements aren't too demanding at first but don't be deceived, later on when you have tens if not hundreds of effects triggering at once, it will really test the limits of your computer so be prepared for that. This game also has quite active developers constantly working to get more content out and with the news of more characters from the original game coming out, I couldn't be more excited. This game is a must have and for its, its almost laughable. Some triple A games don't even get this much replayability out of their games like come on, this is a must have for any person.",True

"The Forest is crazy fun and i strongly urge you to purchase this Early Access game.

PROS:
1. Base building system is very addictive. Flows seamless with the enviroment.
2. The cannibals and mutants are creepy and insane.
3. Beautiful landscape with some great animations like specifically the tree falling animation.
4. A handful of cave systems throughout the island adds extra horror and open world space.
5. The crafting system & stats/info/notes takes a bit of getting used to but it works fine for me.
6. The story line keeps you guessing and wondering the whole time.

CONS:
1. Lack of land/water preditors.
2. Not enough of the wildlife.
3. Map size.

The map size con is reaching a little bit as i think i'm just spoiled with all these other massive open worlds. Even with the caves i feel like the map is on the smaller side and i can span across border to border in minutes.. Caves are another story as they take longer because you WILL get lost in them at least once and that's a promise. 

I understand this game is still considered Early Access and i believe that at it's current state of development it is very much worth the price and if it's on sale purchase it right away! You will not be dissapointed, given you acknowledge it's in alpha.",True

"Pros:
- Nice art IN PLACES.
- They try to discourage random clicking to get solutions by having a scary face woosh at you. It's cute that they tried.
- Many objects are re-usable, which is good.
- The HOG scenes have a bunch of objects all of which are drawn seperately, so I never knew which the correct object was just because it was the only one that didn't gel with the background.
- The dials in the game all rotate both ways based on left or right click. Much less annoying that way.
- The alchemical symbols are pretty accurate (within the extent of my knowledge), and that's nice.

Neutral/subject to opinion:
- The main character, Eve, has an independent mind, and when you pick something up, she usually reminds you what its for Sure, she's just GIVING you the solution to the puzzle...  But also it's good that she's not totally brainless, in fact, with a few leaps of logic, she's almost psychic! example: [spoiler] ""I'll need this horn to escape!""... ""Uh... Will you?"" [/spoiler] 
- You can collect things in advance of knowing what they are to be used for, which is good because it reduces back-tracking and in most hidden object games it's obvious hours in advance you'll end up having to collect something and it's better you can just pick it up rather than needing to note down where it was and come back later. On the other hand, at times it seems deeply weird, again feeding into the whole ""Eve's a creep genius"" thing.
- There are times you have to use objects from your inventory to complete the HOG scenes. This left me bemused at times because I was completely stumped looking for something that WASN'T THERE. Once you realise it though (The hints system helps there) it keeps the scenes varied and interesting.
-The HOG scenes give you a list of 6 and when you find something it replaces what you found with a new item until it runs out, this means you need to find the objects in a certain order, which is bad, but it keeps the list short which is good.
- Pentagrams everywhere. Probably more historically accurate, but disturbing/offensive to those for whom that's a sincere religious symbol. 

Cons:
- The whole game sweats with excessive effort. It doesn't sound like a real thing but it's actually trying too hard. I feel sorry for it. Adds to the comedy though.
- HOGs are the ""Find this item based on name"" style, BUT the names of the item are often slightly wrong, such as ""Hair pin"" instead of ""Hair slide"" which is subtle, sever instances of ""watch"" isntead of ""clock"" but still confusing, through to egregious examples, like one near the end which... I don't remember. BUT IT WAS SUPER CONFUSING. 
- Horrible voice acting, and characters who have wedged themselves into the uncanny valley and installed porta johns.
- Romantic subplot, which was handled with all the subtlety and grace of mating stegasauruses. (I'm not even rating that to be a spoiler because if you didn't see it coming the second the character was introduced, I'm impressed you can at least read)
- ""Horror"" genre is mostly aspirational, and tone is horribly mismatched.
- From each HOG scene you keep only 1 object, which is annoying when you HAD a pair of scissiors two HOG scenes ago but still need to get a new pair before you can use it because... IDK, your character threw those first scissors away?

Rachel Amber successfully meets the hype and is able to also show that there is more to her than a simple ""popular girl.""

"This charming game has been nothing short of delightful. The best way to describe this game is a combination of Animal Crossing and Minecraft. You get to customize your farm to your heart's content and interact with your neighbors similar to Animal Crossing. You also can go off to adventures in the mines, fight monsters and craft items in a Minecraft like style. Unlike Animal Crossing however, each character has unique personalities that are full of charm even if some of your neighbors may seem a bit cold at first. 

Want to focus on your relationships with the characters and maybe even get married? You can do that.

Want to build the most efficient farm possible? You can do that. 

Want to spend your time adventuring in the mines, becoming the best adventurer ever? You can do that too. 

This game doesn't tell you how to play through its world. You choose what type of experience you have meaning you aren't railroaded each time you play. 

In short this game is wonderful and perfect for a rainy day or for after a long day of work. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys casual simulator games.",True
"My hours shown is incorrect. I started playing this while I wasn't able to connect to the internet, and the majority of the hours I have aren't recorded on steam.

The online is also good, even though it is riddled with issues. I haven't played a lot of online on pc yet, but I have 515 hours on gta online on xbox one.",True
"I wish I could wholeheartedly recommend it, but wait for a sale. The cyperpunk world is so, so well done with appropriate signs, NPC chatter and little details scattered about it's a crying shame the game is so linear. But I guess if you make it open world the details would start to get repetitive with the large scale so that's fine. 

The coolest thing is the memory manipulation but they are so few and far between (about 4 to be precise!). What sadly takes the place of the awesome gimmick is the combat. While perfectly decent and responsive, it amounts to little more than button mashing. Thankfully the button mashing is broken up by some pretty nifty powers you unlock as you progress.  Using the powers is WAY more fun than button mashing but they mostly rely on a timer which is another smudge. 

To summarize, check it out. It's not a bad game but it's also not the best. And I say that with a heavy heart because it needed so much more of what makes it unique than what makes it the same as everything else out there.",True

Honestly this game is really hard. It has a nice layout and a fun aspect with lovable items but it is extremly difficult.

"So, I was playing a co-op game (hosting) with my friend in the mountainous, snowy area, and this raccoon started following me everywhere, and if I stood still, it would run circles around me. It was so cute. He was my best friend...until he ran through my fire pit and died...

...and then I started slicing his furry carcass with my axe and he gave me one soda and two snack bars as a gift from beyond the grave. :')

In all seriousness, this is one of the most enjoyable game I've ever played (and the most addictive), and it gets even better when you play with friends. Even just in the alpha stage, there is a lot of exploring you can do, not to mention building and crafting all sorts of things. I love finding little secrets hidden throughout the map with weapons and food items. If you're an explorer like me, you will be rewarded. This game is also one of the more intense/scary games I've played in a while, and I absolutely love it! There's nothing like walking in the forest at night when you can't see much and something sneaks up behind you to attack you. Anyway, before I bore you all to death with my review, I'll end it here. 

If you are even considering buying this game, do yourself a favor and buy it! It's worth every penny!",True

"Coming from Arma, Squad and Red Orchestra/Rising Storm
I found Post Scriptum to be hell of a lot more harder.
Not because the game itself is harder or complex, for a matter of fact, if you've played Squad, Post Scriptum plays just the same, requiring cohesion with your squad mates, communication matters.

The lack of optics and the return to semi-auto and bolt action rifles, definitely increases the coefficient of difficulty while being more rewarding. Nothing like nailing a killing blow with a bolt action at over 300M+

If you liked Red Orchestra, this may be a game for you.
If you liked Squad but you're looking for a less modern theatre, this may be a game for you.

That being said, it's far from a perfect game.
There's quite a few annoying bugs/glitches but nothing that is utterly game breaking.

"Fucking E.Y.E.

This game is the best worst game you'll ever play.

Balance is non-existent.

Every enemy can be killed at level 1 just as easily as level 99.

The RPG elements are farcical and the campaign is a vain attempt at taking a shot at a semi-open world Source Engine game. It doesn't work so well, but it's fun to play. There will be times however the spawning of enemies the moment you turn your back will chafe.

But there is one thing that makes it all worthwhile. Well, two things really. The gunplay is stellar and the ambience is both perfect and completely insane. Most of what you'll do inside the game boils down to killing goofy-looking cyberpunks with cool weapons and it doesn't get old fast. Coming up with crazy new ways to game the system and keep killing not-so-bright foes with ever more roundabout ways is HILLARIOUS. The game is one big sandbox to unleash your inner psychopath anarcho-capitalistic crusader and it does that one thing very, very well.

The campaign is a convoluted tale of two rival cybermonk cults operating under the same rogue agency, with the goal of stopping the monstrous infestations that have begun to ravage the cities of the far future. Much of the backstory is written down the HQ's library. Unfortunately not much of it is actually relevant for the game's plot besides providing the benefit of loose contextualization. To understand the plot, you'll have to pay attention to the many secondary plot points scattered throughout the levels, or alternatively blunder your way through the several branches of the story. In spite of how disjointed this can be at times, I will admit to having spent a lot of in-game time trying to look inside every nook and cranny for that little piece of missing intel that might help me figure out this strange new world.

The campaign levels are massive. From what I gathered, the original level designer made it a point to stretch the Source Engine's capacity to the brim in every level. It shows; the campaign is a labyrinthine affair. Unfortunately, this magnitude in dimension does not manifest itself in density of content; a lot of the areas are never used for anything at all, be it plot points, randomly generated mission objectives or encounters. There's a lot of dead ends that stretch on endlessly, underused and sticking out from areas within the same map that have clearly received a lot of attention and thought put into. The greatest offender is the Mars level (Noctis Labyrinth), a big canyon with several caves linked by a teleporter device. 

There are elements of character progression and a branching plot that requires several playthroughs to truly understand. Most of the skills are really just complements to your shooting action; it will be very hard to advance as a strict psy-ability user or a strict cyber-enhancement user, as the former's abilities either do not return money and experience for kills or put the user at risk and the latter comprise of straight buffs and utility skills. Ultimately, increasing your many stats serves as nothing more than a means to unlock specific abilities and weapons that require a certain threshold be met, not so much the slight benefits they bring overtime that are useful to have, but do not make as great of a difference as they could.

Psy abilities are possibly the most oblique tool in your arsenal. You can convert discarded items for health, clone yourself Naruto-style or create a single powerful copy of yourself, transform an enemy into a powerful monster and unleash it against its former foes, teleport inside a foe and frag him and earn several other insta-kill powers as you complete the branches of the campaign. The latter are extremely powerful but also extremely costly in both psi power and health. They may also put your character in harm's way as there is no telling when the system will spawn a batch of foes just as you've ran out of energy to utilize the cheat abilities the game was built around using.

The cyber enhancements range from straight up buying new cyberlimbs with context-sensitive buffs to purchasing new systems and abilities, like the perennial cybercloak, a power converter that turns health into psi, aiming systems that turn the most innacurate POS gun into a laser-guided sniper and a fairly useless body armor skill that turn your cyberpower into a secondary health bar (It doesn't work as you'll just die slower and lose power for the all-defeating cloak). 

It was clear that these abilities were planned for a more tactical FPS/RPG, to be used in the right moment at the right time. This ""right moment"" has to be guaranteed by a judicious management of your three bars: health, psi power and cyber power. As you progress in the game, you will have the option to purchase equipment that will allow you to convert these metrics into another; psi for health (with a sacrifice of a discarded equipable), power for health and health for power. 

You have an array of options to customize how hard or how easy you want the game to be, from AI perception and accuracy to frequency and size of spawns to straight up damage. At some point, you will have to increase the difficulty to keep things challenging as your abilities turn the game ever easier; and to obtain greater rewards from killing foes and completing missions. Once you've maxed out all metrics, the game becomes more of an exercise in management and diversion of the AI's focus rather than a high-octane shooter; in a sense, this is what E.Y.E is supposed to be. A game where you play as an elite soldier using the highest end of technology and sorcery to dominate the battlefield whilst engaging in covert mercenary affairs under the pretense of safeguarding humanity from the Metastreumonic force.

E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is as bizarre as the name would suggest. A big mix of cyberpunk and 40K references in Source shooter format, with liberal doses of insanity and obscure interests thrown into the mix. By the looks of it, Streumon Studios won't be making a sequel anytime soon as they are currently working on another 40K title. It's likely this game will become a solitary entry, but for all the fanbase's wish for a sequel, I fear that E.Y.E 2 wouldn't capture the sheer coincidental awesomeness of this disjointed piece of shit. It's a bad game that has enough great things to become a great game, but only for people who can enjoy convoluted stories and systems and make the best of them.

"Back in the 1990's and early 2000's I was lucky enough to call the folks at Cyan (who made MYST and Riven) people I had met and discussed their games with directly, including sitting with Tim Larkin in his studio while he shared with me some of his techniques for making the music to URU. I wrote a 5 page review of MYST III:Exile that was published during E3 in that year with the help of Presto Studios (man, that was a long time ago, I'm an older gamer), so I love adventure games. I love FPS games too, don't get me wrong, but adventure games are really hard to do correctly. That is why, when one comes along that does it right, it can become far more engaging than even the best FPS for me. Solus is one of those games. 

Solus has an extremely engaging and simple inventory system that work to help both solve puzzles and keep you alive. The survivalist aspect of Solus is so well implemented, that simply trying to gauge the weather and atmospheric conditions consumed a full three days of my time at one point (which was entirely my choice since I figured it was probably important to understand if the weather was going to be my friend or not). There's more, of course, to Solus that simply that, but the point is that there are a lot of layers to Solus that reveal themselves only if you really push yourself. And if you get killed, you have only yourself to blame.

The game has really good velocity, and never stagnates into a hunt-and-click. In fact, that somewhat annoying aspect of adventure games is completely missing in this game, much to my delight. 

Solus is really beautiful. OK, the skyscapes are in fact stunning. Watching the celestial mechanics can be entrancing in this game. I really feel like I'm on another world here. I almost want to go buy a VR headset just to see what that must be like. I'm sure it's really amazing. The rock textures and plant textures could be better, and the water effects also seem a bit thin even when all my settings pegged at ultra. But the balance they have struck between beauty and performance is so well acheived that this really is just a nit that I mention because I'm sure someone will pick it. :) 

The Solus Project implements survivalist adventure gaming in the most engaging and immersive way imaginable, with a storyline that I like because it's not overly complicated, is plausible, and it ends in a way that to me seemed very likely given what we are learning about the universe around us today. 

The game runs completely bug free for me, but I understanding the first release was not really that stable. I haven't experienced any problems at all. I love this game.",True
"I originally first played this game when it released on console, Xbox One... How far it has come! There is so much to do, so much to see, soooo much to freaking loot, and no matter how many times I lay it to rest, it just keeps resurrecting itself from the dead! If you've ever watched The George A. Romero Dead series (Night, Dawn, Day, and all the in-between) and wondered ""I am so ready for the zombie apocalypse."" Then do yourself a favor and please play this already... Please experience your own Night of the Living Dead scenario with RPG elements and character progression. No matter how much I play this game, it just won't f***ing die. Currently 259 hours on PC. Probably close to 500+ hours on console...

"My god the combat is satisfying slice crunch topple enemies (and vice versa!) with sword, metal bar or any object somewhat resembling a stick. Expect to spend few hours learning the physics based system which starts out as a drunken swordmanship simulator. The practise mode against toughening opponents is perfect fun for getting the gist of the combat. Afterwards you want to come back and see just with how little equipment you can manage get through the gauntlet.

Assumedly there's still a lot more content coming, even though you can spend days in the story mode alone, as it is. The game is unforgiving but fair, which really adds to the satisfaction of killing and surviving the opponents. Truly, introducing sledgehammer to your opponent's head has never been this satisfying, as some other reviewer put it. The graphics are bleak and sharp and I enjoyed the aesthetics very much indeed.

The game crashes seldomly, however, you can always return to the exact point of the crash, so nothing is lost in the process. And I have to start the game on fresh boot to get good framerate at times. Still, all this is meaningless to the freshness and quality of approach presented.

"Battletech feels like an early access title or beta needing some serious polishing and balance.

I have to give this a thumbs down because the ai cheats.  The enemy units get more movement than they should, they sometimes are able to shoot twice per round, they don't play on random dice rolls for hit and often aren't blocked by terrain features that block line of sight (on direct fire weapons).  The player doesn't have access to any of these cheats, even via skill upgrades.  Further, there's no unit point count or anything that reasonably gives an even match. Often missions feature unit spam where the ai just keeps spamming in more units as the player's units run out of ammo.

Allowing the ai to cheat *IS* a genuine means of controlling difficulty in computer games, circa 1985 (when Battletech the tabletop game originated).  However, 35 years on, game developers should be using more advanced ways to manage difficulty.  There's also no difficulty setting (despite a tooltip mentioning difficulty settings).  

Other problems:
1) The maps.  Distances are...wonky.  There's no hexes or direct movement distance measurement.  So, it's impossible to tell how far an enemy unit will be able to move in the next round if trying to use cover or line of sight.  

1b) The map camera.  It's difficult to use the camera to determine what the game considers line of site. Worse, the camera likes to go cinematic during the enemy move and will choose BAD angles so you don't even see whether the attack on your unit or what the damage was. You have to remember from round to round what the status of all the armor on each of your four mechs was to know which was hit where.

2) Feeding into #1, there's no listing anywhere in the game, not even the mech info screens, to indicate speed.  Again, this makes turn planning difficult (especially in campaign when ai units will sprint AND attack in the same turn.

3) There is no indicator for how much heat a mech can dissipate each round.  So, building your mechs is trial and error.  Deciding which weapons to use in combat is also trial and error as you attempt to manage heat (made even more difficult by ai enemy spam).  There is a heat display on the ui and each weapons has it's heat listed, but the ui doesn't include numbers, just a bar that fills.  So, planning is more difficult than it should be.

4) Cost of mech repairs is insane.  This pushes a player to use the heaviest mechs they can and pull off weapons to maximize armor (this goes a bit hand in hand with #3, you'll pull weapons when trial and error'ing heat management). 

5) Evasion helps the ai more than you.  Basically, you're forced to run the heaviest mechs you can.  If you like heavy, slow mechs, it's great.  If you want a faster, more agile lance you are going to be punished by ai shooting you right through your evasion pips).  Meanwhile you pretty much have to close to within ""90 meters"" (vaguely defined because of #1) to have a higher chance to hit with close range support weapons. 

6) Melee, often you will miss on melee attacks, especially against the ai light mechs.  The ai will punish you if you allow them to get within melee range of one of your lights.  

The non-campaign missions have some, but not all, of the problems of the campaign ai.  It's this fact that indicates the campaign ai is either doing scripted things that are going to happen regardless or it is set up to cheat.

Pros:
1) Graphics are decent.  But most of combat occurs zoomed out.  
2) Mechs are highly customizable, limited to hardpoint number and type
3) Voice acting bits for flavor
4) Main ui is easy to use, traveling to different areas of the ship with a click
5) Combat is actually fairly intuitive, excepting the problems listed above

Edit: after further play, I give this 3 thumbs down and a middle finger up for the S.L.O.W. loading times combined with the fact that you need to load each mission 3-5 times to combat the ai cheating.  Having to reload due to poor design and balance is bad.  Having to wait through the L.O.N.G. load time is ridiculous. 

This would be an amazing game, if it was properly tested, balanced, and without the ai cheats.
The player is forced to save scum to counteract this nonsense.  It's an infuriating error in design.  If you're OK with reloading the same mission several times to get an even playing field with the ai, this game is a decent value.  My time played on this game would be 70% less for equal progress if I didn't have to constantly reload.

Edit:  the ai also gets a big boost to its weapons' knockdown damage as well as ai movement clears more of its knockdown damage, which is just super annoying...and LAME.",False
"It is VAST - I love it because of this. There is almost any possible unit available that the real world has to offer, from tactical bombers with long range cruise missles which represent flying artillery up to nuke trucks or even anti nuke missiles missiles... This game as an enormous depth, since you not only have ground, sea & air but also the orbit and even multiple planets.

If you hated these turtles which have abused map corners, then this game is a blessing, since every map is a sphere or multiple spheres rotating around a central sun.

This game gets regular updates and has a competitive community with organized tournaments where you can actually make some money - a real e-sport RTS which gives you a vast army where you have to wisely choose your build by prioritizing certain unit types, since you can not afford to build everything at once.

Because of this choices you have to make careful decisions about how you invest your focus, time and resources to perfectly counter your opponent.

There are several opportunities in the course of a match to actually start investing into a new ""branch"" like adding vehicles to the bot & air standard combo, or naval units, in order to turn the tables, which might result in an interesting pulling match between mass production and the technological arms race, possible switching the upper hand several times.

The amount of units, the availability of high quality mods which are also widely accepted and the extreme complexity of the possibilities make this a truly challenging gem to master!

I have played many RTS, from C&C up to The Settlers or the Total War Series, Northgard and so on.
This RTS is definitely the most versatile in terms of available units and infrastructure for each of the two armies.
If considering the genre of modern-scifi warfare RTS, excluding Total War Series, which has a higher unit count in total, but yet not even the diverse faction Rome can match the variety of a single PA Titans army.

It feels very difficult to play my old C&C Titles after playing this, because all I loved is met here and even more.

"For a quick-and-easy review: The overall story is pretty compelling, and is worth checking out if you are interested in Homestuck.

I can give you a whole breakdown on the every character, but to keep things simple- I liked a large portion of these characters- even some of the more basic ones. The writing does a very good job at balancing a personality-less protagonist, and you the player. Subtle writing decisions tick your brain in the right time and places, so it truly feels like an adventure. Sure, that's the point right? Well, duh- but it nailed it on the head in the right ways to really suit the world of Homestuck. It shows us so much more of a world largely unexplored in the comic, and it is a treat to finally explore Alternia beyond a few cliffsides or islands. 
If you're a fan of Homestuck- you probably already bought this. If you're not but- just happen to be curious, I think it's worth playing. You might even find yourself staring down a young man in his bedroom for the first time soon after!

The game throws quite a few surprises at you and has excellent replay value for reasons you'll understand after you've beaten the game.  The controls are easy and natural, the dialogue flow and choice boxes just interfere with the gameplay until you get used to them, I suggest waiting for characters to stop talking to do actions beyond walking in the same area - unless you don't want to hear what they have to say.  The radio usage is clever and resourceful, especially in how it conveys lore.

great gem,True
"Fun game, got a decent bit into it before I burned out.

Pros:
- Co-op integration is really well done, only bug I ever experienced was my friend getting stuck in a van. Honestly though that was such a random and bewildering bug that I'm not sure if that was a result of it being co-op. 
- Love the GTA/open world feel to a campaign game, frequently passing by side quests and missions to do. 
- Night time and missions in dark environments are very spooky, I enjoyed the stealth aspect 
- Graphics are amazing, without a doubt, and the game runs very very smoothly
- The speeeeeeeeed parkour in this game is very satisfying 
- Bashing zombies and popping heads are also very satisfying, for a while anyways

Cons:
- Looting becomes underwhelming. After a while you hoard up enough of the base crafting materials that it just gets repetitive. Ambulances and police vehicles everywhere, you stack up medkits and ammo too easily. 
- Weapon mods are okay, not amazing. Not much diversity in the way of attachments or craftable upgrades.
- Virals EVERYWHERE. Can't shoot a gun without getting chased by these annoying things. They're not difficult to dispatch, just a nuisance.
- Skill trees are disappointing. Half the perks I unlocked are useless and unnecessary, and honestly the combat becomes repetitive after a while even with the different mobs that come up later in the game.
- Story is... well. This is just my personal opinion that I put it in the cons list. The premise of the story hooked me, and I liked the story early on as well as the characters but as it progressed... the way the main character saves himself is just cheesy to me. So many cutscenes of the main character just becoming batman and dodging bullets somehow, it's ridiculous. Maybe I'm being too hard on the story but I personally just am not a fan of the typical action movie trope and I eventually lost interest.

My specs are R5 3600x, 5700xt and 16gb ram and the game runs smoothly on 1080p at 250-300 fps with everything maxed.

Buy it on sale if you can, iirc I got the enhanced edition for about 10 USD.

"I have had the pleasure to play this game for the last two days and I am not disappointed. I'll try to make this review as good as I possibly can.

Lifeless Planet sends the player into an unknown world full of mysteries and puzzles to solve. You play as an astronaut (whose name I have sadly already forgotten), who was sent to a planet far away from earth. After having spent 15 years in a spaceship, the protagonist finally arrives at the already described destination but is quickly confronted with a problem: a lack of oxygen. This is where the game starts. 

My first impression: It looks nice. I have always been a fan of games showing an atmosphere that sticks with you for a while. This game probably is one of them, since it never ceases to amaze the player with nice-looking surroundings. Another aspect I really love about this game is the music and its voiceacting, whereas I would have loved to have more of both. The player gets to listen to small pieces of a conversation between the protagonist and a woman from time to time which I always thought were interesting. They give a small insight on the astronaut's past. The Russian audiologs were very cool as well. (9/10 for the audio. 10/10 if there had been more)

The astronaut soon discovers a Russian village and - of course - can't believe his eyes and thus believes that he is back on earth and that he has been played a trick on. From this point on the player moves from one area to another, which usually are connected to each other by small puzzles. The already mentioned audiologs and documents help the player to understand where he is and what has happened. Not too much time in the game and you are confronted with a female inhabitant, living on the planet you are walking on. Your main aim from now on is to follow her and to try to get some answers to the many questions that are still open. Don't worry, at the end none of them should be left. 

The story was interesting to follow. At first I did not expect the documents to be able to tell a whole story, but now - after having played the game - I can say that I didn't have any problems understanding the plot. I find it very well thought out and would thus give it a 9/10.

The graphics are beautiful. Of course, you can't compare it to other newer titles or the Crysis games, but that's not what the game developers tried to go for anyway. I was positively surprised by the many areas you walk through and are able to (partly) discover. It varies from a desert-like landscape to glaciers, waterfountains, lava, forests, and much, much more. Designing these many arials must require creativity which this game sure didn't lack of. The graphics fit the game just well, so I'll give it a 8/10

Gameplay. That's where Lifeless Planet doesn't hold up to the price it is being sold for. I wouldn't say that it was not fun for me to play, not at all. There are many repetitive parts and puzzles which you usually soon get the hang of, but the different surroundings and dangerous, creepy traps made it a new experience every time. Nevertheless, most of it was rather easy to solve and I never really found myself in a situation, where I had to think for more than 5 minutes in order to find the solution for a problem. A big part of the game consists of jumping from platform to platform which - once you have required the extra boost for your jetpack - is really fun. The controls were the average ones which were not a problem for me (thus giving them a 10/10), whereas some other people have complained about them being too sloppy or unprecise when doing long jumps. All in all the gameplay could have been a lot better by adding a greater variety of puzzles and missions to solve, but the surroundings made up for it and I often caught myself simply exploring what there was - even though most of the times there was nothing worth to see expect a collectible mineral. 6/10

It took me about 7 hours to play through the whole game, but I really tried to take a look at everything instead of rushing through one area to the next one. In another review someone had written, the author said that the game was too short and that the achievement for the first playthrough being under 4 hours was too easy. Well, I have to disagree. You can get many more hours out of it when really looking for the minerals (which are worth two achievements too by the way) and exploring hills and buildings. I believe that 7 hours for a 10€ game is a good deal. 

Let's come to an end. I definitely recommend playing Lifeless Planet when you are someone who doesn't need highend graphics or a moment of action every five minutes. This game is - in my opinion - made for people who are patient, who like to take their time and who focus on music and sound, because that's where the game scores. It sometimes reminded me and can be compared to a game like ""Journey"" on the PlayStation. It is worth 10€, but I probably wouldn't buy it for the original price, which is 20€. 

I hope this review convinced you to either buy or not buy this game. Thank you for reading.

P.S.: The game scared me at some points. It was all good and fun though. :)",True

The route featuring Nemui, (the cute color-changing lizard girl) stood out in particular to me. Making a mental log and guessing at her colors. Guessing the ""important"" color struck me hard when I realized how far off I was on that particular color. 

The puzzles are a fun addition, but could definitely use improvement.

Failing the puzzles intentionally however takes far too long with the player required to wait down the timer several times during a playthrough.

Ship combat was moderately interesting the first time throguh, but the last three pirate encounters quickly become a slog on subsequent playthroughs. Some kind of text based hint on which of the three ships you need to avoid might alleviate the feeling that the last three comabts require save scumming. 

Mutiny!! is a fun mostly light hearted romp and I look forward to seeing more of Lipiesoft's elves and moster girls in the future.",True

"BDO, BDO, BDO... How to summarize this game...

It's as if you were recieving a gift at christmas, with a magnificent wrapping, really beautiful, but the inside was what you already had in your house for the past fifteen years, and was also outdated in the way you use it. Yeah, I think that's how I'd put it.

I can imagine people will look at my time played (24h at the moment), and will roll their eyes thinking I know nothing of the game. But I think 20+ hours is already enough to have an idea about how the game feels to me. And after those 24 hours of game, I can tell this game isn't made for me, just like it clearly isn't made for everyone. Should I just play more before giving my opinion on the game? I could, but for that I'd need to want to play the game more. And this game just makes it its little malevolent game to poke you with annoying little things to push you to just give up altogether.

Let's start with the good things. The game is beautiful. No doubt about that, the game is really looking great, especially the environments based on a lot more south european-ish scenery that changes from those fantasy settings we have usually, the optimization is alright (could manage to run it at 40+ FPS on medium settings on a 4 years old rig), the character creation is, by far, one of the best, if not -the- best on the market, and the combat system, quite in-depth and dynamic, based a lot on combos like in a versus fighting game, is really a breath of fresh air in this kind of game. Crafting is decent, the economy system, managed by the players, is interesting as well.

But I'm afraid the list ends there. Because once the mesmerizing effect of that beauty and freshness fades away, we're left with a very basic MMORPG, with a quite terrible handling at how things are done.

GENDERLOCKED CLASSES. Seriously? Why? Just why, why locking classes behind gender? I do I -have- to play a damn girl in bikini armor if I want to play the Ranger or Dark Knight? Was it too much to ask to just have a male for those as well?

The HUD and the ergonomy of the menus, for a start, might seem trivial to some, but in a game like this one, where there's a lot to do through menus and maps, it isn't. And oh boy are these HUD and ergonomy a horrible, horrible thing. It's quite easy, I think I've never seen something being such a pain in the rear to navigate through. All the infos overlap each other, there's no clear way to see what you wanna see at the first glance, there's no visibility or clarity whatsoever.

The story, some people might think it's secondary in an MMO, but it's always pleasant to have a storyline to follow as you level up, just so the game doesn't feel like an endless grind over just to reach the last level only to grind more. Here, the story is very basic, and the quests accompanying it are... just a pain. Plain and simple. It's easy, 99% of them can be summarized at ""Kill X mobs at Y location"", or ""Loot X on Ymobs at Z location"". All the time. The first ten hours, it's alright, after that it becomes really difficult to cope with it. Makes the game just feel like an endless grind of mobs to gain levels. What year is it, 2001?

The cash shop is overpriced. Like, way too overpriced. From inventory expansion (that you end having to buy if you don't want to have your inventory filled in 10 minutes due to the buy2play restrictions), to pretty outfits that are literally the only way to look cool and different (as in not having the same clothes as everyone else around you), that shop is way too intrusive, and just downrigt offending by the price tags it sports.

There's probably more at higher level, but considering I've heard it only from friends who play the game extensively, I cannot pronounce myself on those, and I really, really can't be arsed to go any further in this game. It just doesn't give me the drive to do it.

TL;DR? The game looks nice, but smells foul. Can't recommend, unfortunately, despite many good ideas and a wasted potential.",False
"Darkwood was a game that I have been looking for for a while now. The game is gritty but not too unforgiving to make it seem unfair. It has a learning curve that you overcome by simply playing the game and learning it's mechanics. Each day requires planning, organization and setup to not fail. It has its serious scares and suspenseful combat. Even the story itself is followed by a great ambient soundtrack, and beautifully artistic character art.

"Right off the bat, the artstyle and gunplay are joyful and enticing. The music and SFX only add to the experience and the feel of the entire game is almost perfect. With thousands of possible item combinations and even more possible playstyles, as well as the different classes, bosses, etc, the game has almost limitless replayability. The fact that it is online Co-op adds another level of enjoyement, as many other Rogue-likes don't feature such modes.

With the new updates adding exponetially more to do in the game, the level of fun and challange only grows in a positive way. Co-op has been polished, items are better looking, and the new guns hit hard and feel terrific.

The Discord Server is another great boon for the community, adding a way to interface with other players, set up co-op games, and even talk to the amazing devs. The communtiy is such a fun place to be in. I am excited to see how the game develops and where this amazing idea will go.",True

It had a slow start for me, but once I got out of Goodsprings and started exploring the game really opened up.

"Here's the thing about a lot of the negative reviews. Many of them have sub ten hours in playtime, some even have sub 5. Now, here's what I'll acknowledge: this game can be frustrating on Normal difficulty. 

- There's some heavy tutorialization which can bog down gameplay and there's some vacant tutorialization that doesn't adequately lead you through the nuances of how this game approaches the Rogue-like genre. 
- There are some grind-y elements in the game, specifically the level-locked dungeons and the goo-monster-walls limiting exploration.

But if you take the time and effort to forgive the developers these brief slights you'll find yourself rewarded with an incredible single or co-op gaming experience. The game is rewardingly difficult. Has varied enemies and dungeons with some f***ing awesome dungeons mechanics (looking at you golf and vinyl frisbee dungeons). 

Not to mention one of the most fun couch co-op experiences I've had in a while. 

Not to mention one of the most polished games in animation and art style I've seen in a while.

Not to mention pretty deep gameplay that can genuinely change with the addition of a sticker, new weapon, or new enemy type. 

Not to mention cool rogue-like mechanics like buying items into your next playthrough, buying extra lives, and seeing the world decay as you fail.

Not to mention I'm still finding things I've never once seen in the game as I approach 10 hrs of playtime.

"For a game I have played for less than an hour, ORION: Dino Horde left a lasting expression on me. Not the kind of lasting expression that leaves a pleasent taste in your mouth, like tasting Auntie Anne's fresh home-brewed strawberry lemonade, more like the the type of expression that horribly scarrs you for the rest of your life.

I bought this game for a very steep price, like, dirt dirt cheap. I could have bought gum instead of this game, if that puts in perspective. This game, unlike gum, did not leave a good taste in my mouth, and I'm pretty sure a piece of Trident layers would have lasted me longer than this game.

Upon launching, I was greeted with a nearly 780 FPS loading screen, which subsequently dropped to an FPS of about 20. I can run solitaire at a good 25 FPS, so this game had no excuse. When entering the very first game ever with one of my friends who I talked into buying this game, promising him we can shoot dinosaurs in the face until the early morning. He called me a nerd, and he was right. I was a nerd who was sucked into this game under promises of shooting dinosaurs and having fun. 

My hopes were smashed, and upon dying to a lag-spiked Triceratops who appeared to be doing the thriller, I called the game ""bad."" My friend also agreed, telling me I sucked quite an exorbant amount of male genitalia for making him buy this game. Alas, he was true. I do suck.

This game does not look at all like it is from 2009, and could easily pass for a game that came out yesterday.

"This game has several issues:

Game is buggy: Sometimes when survivour get hanged, they bug out while they die sticking there infinitly. This makes it impossible for the killer to win since the game will never end. He HAS to leave and get full penalty for it.

Bad balancing: Since the beta there is the issue that survivours juke the killer infinite at windows. While they attemped to fix this by removing some windows on some maps, its still working on an extremely wide range of locations.

This game lacks on propper match making: You can not party up together with your friends in match making. So you eighter can play with your friend 1v1 wich is not fun at all (belive me ive tried) or ditch your friend and play with complete strangers.

This game is in an alpha state and calls itself a full release. To be fair its rather cheap thats why the rating is not worse:

"This is a Great zombie game. This game is really really fun if you're playing with friends, not only that but the campaigns are really REALLY GOOD, Why? They have a great story, character development is quick but despite that, as you play, you get to know their character and it's really really good. Whats good about Left 4 Dead 2 is that there is no paid content at ALL, all you have to do is buy the game in steam and that's it, everything is free, well who knows maybe i will get proven wrong since there could be possible future paid DLC's and the xbox does have paid DLC BUT for the time being, there is no paid inside content and the game just comes in all together just for $5. If you're really finding for one of the best and cheapest zombie games out there, i'd recommend this game I actually used to have this game and boy am i glad that they added the L4D1 campaigns into the L4D2 game, which means all you need is L4D2 and that's it, but you can also buy the first game if you like. This game is really good because you actually get to play with custom campaigns made by the community and you also get a wide variety of mods to select from. The zombies are just amazing, you get the common infected and the special infected and damn, the special infected are grreeaattttttt, its so good, you got the boomer who has a vomit that attracts the common infected, you've got the hunter who is basically pins you down in the stealthiest way possible, unless you catch it, you also got the witch who if you disturb, you get pinned down by, you got the charger who is just amazing, he charges into you and pins you down, you also have the spitter who spits a puddle of acid and you also have the best special infected EVER, the TANK, the Tank is the coolest special infected EVER, the zombie is just a natural buff killer and he's just the BEST of the best. The common infected may be common, but there are also alot of common zombies who catches your eye, for example the mud zombie, the construction worker zombie and the clown zombie. The cool thing about Left 4 Dead 2 is that there are add-ons that can make your game split screen, yes, SPLIT SCREEN and its sooo good, that is unless if you have a really good PC/Laptop that can handle 2 split screens. Now lets go with the specs part, yes there are minimal specs that are saying ""Oh you need an Nvidia or an AMD graphics card to really play the game"" And that is true BUT as a low spec gamer, i can definitely confirm that this is a really good game even if you have a weak laptop, my specs are: Intel Celeron Processor N3350 and an intel HD 500 specs, i put down the settings really really low with a resolution of 4:3 and not wide screen, and i tell you, lowering down the graphics can give you a treat, it really helped the game run faster and yes there are a little bit of lag when encountering hordes, but over all, its already enough to run the game and enjoy it. This game is a treat to play and i totes recommend it if you wanna find a game that is cheap and worth your time, i even recommend if you buy this game on sales since they cheapen the price into a dollar. Anyways this game is great and you should try it out.

"I am giving this game 6/10. While S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series is phenomenal, this part is actually the worst in my opinion. It has some things from Shadow of Chernobyl fixed, but still trying to get immersed with this game may prove difficult. First of all - crashes and instability. I have played vanilla version without any mods, on a weak laptop with Win7. There were few places when game instantly crash and quit to Windows, so hard-saving very often is advised. People usually get crash while travelling to/from Garbage, but DirectX10 was proven to be the issue. I had it disabled from the beggining, so that problem didn't occur to me. I had two irritating issues for which I had to find way around it. First - during main mission with getting Fang's PDA, where you have to enter trapped cellar on Flea Market - game was quitting to Windows every time the cutscene finished. To help it, stash all of your equipment in nearest box, it prevents game to crash (weirdly). Second one - that damned Drifter guy you rescue from blind dogs at Cordon - despite latest updates for this game, this guy can't sell you information about stash, where you can find one of the flash drives for technician quest. After some time you will find that guy laying dead in Rookie Village, making this quest impossible to complete. If you are completionist like me, there's a way to complete it - download Helios Spawn Mod 1.3 from ModDB, read manual how to bring spawn menu and use Misc/Other option. This way you will get all possible flash drives and other items like PDA's in your inventory. Go to any corpse and stash unnecessary items in it, leaving only that one flash drive you need. Make note, that you will also spawn quest items for future main quests, but you will be able to obtain them normal way anyway, so don't worry. So to conclusion. Minuses : game's unstability and random crashes, quite pointless and meaningless plot, problems with faction wars, making them irrevelant later in game. Pluses : fixed quest system from SoC (no time to collect reward, no random pop-in quests with a reward on the other side of Zone), fixed animations and upgraded textures, ability to upgrade/repair equipment.

This game is actually quite old so there is no point for judging it, but if you want to immerse in it, you would prefer to play this game with mods, like Reclamation Project.

Overall this game is still good, like the whole series - it is advised to play the series from first to last part to get the Zone plot continuity.

"[h1]Story and Characters[/h1]

I thought the story was decent, at best. It felt very clichê at various points, very predictable, and you don't spend much time with most of the characters to fully connect with them and know their backstory, except for Arno and [spoiler]his love interest,[/spoiler] Élise. Arno and Élise aren't necessarily boring, but I also didn't come to care much for either of them, as I did with most of the protagonists from previous Assassin's Creed games. During most of the game, I felt that the main targets you had to assassinate were introduced too quickly and died too early. Back in AC2, an entire DNA sequence built up to a Templar's death: you spent said sequence learning about them, what they do and what they are, finally formulating a plan to kill them. Now it's just ""hear vaguely about him, assassinate him in the next mission, learn about a new target from his memories and kill him in the next 2 or 3 missions"". It kinda felt repetitive to me, like AC1 was. One little addition I wasn't particularly fond of was replacing the usual ""memory corridor"" that appears when you kill a main target and hear a sort of confession from each one. In Unity, you see important flashbacks from the target, and you don't get to talk to them as you did in previous games, which doesn't feel personal and doesn't let you learn more about their motivations. A true shame, some of my favorite moments from the series come from those ""confessions"". However, the next game of the series, AC Syndicate, brings these ""confessions"" back.

I also didn't feel very connected with the ""Dead Kings"" DLC's story or with its world. For those wondering, it's a free DLC that adds a new region: Franciade. It's set in 1794, after the end of Robespierre's Reign of Terror, and it adds a new faction, the Raiders, that are trying to collect an ancient artifact.

Finally, there's the modern day story. I wasn't a big fan of Black Flag and Rogue's approach to the present day story. I get that you're kinda role-playing as yourself, but it's not directly connected to the war between Assassins and Templars, you just wander around, hacking stuff and [b]learning[/b] about the struggle between those 2 factions, instead of actually [b]participating[/b] in it. But Unity just made it worse. This time, you don't actually [b]play[/b] in the present, you're an Initiate, a sort of recruit of the Assassin Brotherhood, and you just watch short cutscenes where an Assassin codenamed Bishop tells you what to do. I felt the modern day story died [spoiler]with Desmond[/spoiler] back in AC3 and this one doesn't add anything new to it. Judging from the last scene in AC Rogue, the least we can hope for is a [spoiler]confrontation between Rogue's Abstergo employee and Unity/Syndicate's Initiate,[/spoiler] however that plays out.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

I was generally pleased by the combat system, however, there were times when the AI felt really dumb. For example, if I hit a guard with a Berserk Phantom blade, the other guards seem very over-powered compared to the ""poisoned"" guard, which usually left me frustrated. The fights are certainly more difficult than previous entries of the franchise. You can't take on 20 enemies at a time and hope to leave unscathed. You have to quickly parry and dodge attacks, while seizing opportunities to counter-attack with both fast and strong attacks. While the animations are pretty cool, the controls drive me mad sometimes, making Arno go or jump somewhere I don't want or attack the wrong enemy in combat.

Stealth itself is not as good as it could be. We finally get a crouch button, which definitely helps avoiding detection, and you can move from cover to cover. The ""whistle"" feature is not available in this game, which would come in handy in various situations. One thing that kept annoying me was the fact that, sometimes, I would get detected while I was clearly out of the guards' sight, which would completely ruin my stealthy approach to certain missions. While it could use some improvement, I'm glad we finally have a decent stealth system.

There are several types of weapons and throwable objects you can use in battle or during stealth, like one-handed, long and heavy weapons, rifles, pistols, several bombs, the hidden and phantom blades, and the guillotine guns, which are included in the ""Dead Kings"" DLC. By using them strategically, whether in combat or during stealth, you can really get the upper hand on your enemies. You also need medicine to restore health, which is more immersive.

[h1]World and Atmosphere[/h1]

I loved the depiction of Revolutionary Paris in the game. The city was created on a 1:1 scale, which makes for an absolutely massive map, filled with thousands of angry citizens, nobles and guards. You can certainly learn a lot about Paris' historical landmarks through the Database, a concept that as been available since AC2, which is great for History nerds like me. I believe it's one of the time periods that best depicts the concept of the Assassins, and I'm only sad the game wasn't as great as it could've been. While we're on the topic of how big the city is, let me talk about collectibles: there are too many. You can get rich very easily, which kinda renders most of the chests useless. The city is so big it will make completionists go mad while searching for everything. It gets boring very quickly. 

You also get a player home, like always, called Café Theatre, where you can watch plays, train moves, observe the mementos, which you get for completing quests and side objectives, and collect your incomes. You can renovate places called ""social clubs"", where you can accept quests that expand the Brotherhood's reach throughout Paris, and consequently increase your incomes. 

There are various side missions you can complete, whether you are protecting people, assassinating targets, etcera. The most complex of these missions are the murder mysteries, were you have to collect various clues and accuse the right suspect, earning money and a new weapon after completing each one.

[h1]Customization[/h1]

I don't have much to say about this topic. You can buy and upgrade several weapons/pieces of equipment, which have different attributes. You can dye your clothes with several sets of colors, except for the special outfits, which only have their default color. In addition, you can buy perks with points you gain from completing main and co-op missions, divided into 4 categories: Melee, Ranged, Stealth and Health.

[h1]Co-op[/h1]

Co-op was one of the features I was most looking forward too when I got the game. You can play with up to 3 friends, no matter their skill level. There are 2 types of co-op missions: regular missions to help the Assassins, and heists, where you have to get the loot, and, if you don't get detected, you get a monetary bonus. You can also join other players' clubs, or create your own, and complete challenges with your fellow club members. In my honest opinion, it's one of the best features of the entire game, which saddens me to know they removed it from the next main game. The traditional PvP multiplayer that has been around since AC Brotherhood was completely removed from the game, and it doesn't make a return in AC Syndicate, just like Unity's co-op mode.

[h1]Optimization[/h1]

I can say this is, without a doubt, the buggiest game I have ever played on PC, so beware of that if you're considering buying it. I didn't have any crashes to desktop, but several bugs forced me to reload a checkpoint because I got stuck somewhere. Even with the latest patches, the game continues poorly optimized for PC, even though I didn't find flying civilians or missing head textures.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

The game isn't as revolutionary or as great as we hoped it would be, but, deep down, I had fun with it. I would only recommend it while it's on sale, and [b]not[/b] to newcomers of the franchise.",True
"Don't take this new game lightly. I've lost 3 times already on the first night. With the added animatronics, the new looks, the new sounds, this game keeps you on your toes. Eeesh..",True
From the soundtrack to its gameplay its simply a true work of art done by one man. Thank You STARDEW VALLEY.,True
"Fun game 
",True
"a very relaxing, atmospheric experience. Not so much a game, more of an interactive movie.

+Great writing, engaging story
+Funny and genuine dialogue
+Art style is nice and lends a good atmosphere
+details and easter eggs can be hilarious

-Not a ton of content
-Not much replayability
-Game mechanics can be a bit clunky

=Ending is up to interpretation on whether it is good or not


In all, grab this game on sale, sit down, grab a six-pack and enjoy a good story",True

"Counter-Guard Break are broken, never works. Everybody abuses the broken mechanic which is guard breaking linking it with combos that are sometimes impossible to get out of. 

Nerfs and Buffs that are coming will break the game further more with the Conqueror getting nerfed for a thing that the Valkyrie will be getting buffed with and keeps the same thing that the Conqueror is being nerfed for. 
(Just experienced it first hand from facing a Valkyrie, which is bullshit for other characters is getting nerfed for.)
Valkyrie is getting buffed with more stamina to do her infinite combo, so if you want to play someone in this game and win all the time, then pick the Valkyrie and use her combo numerous times.

Cliffing and throwing people into spikes is the new norm, people will run from you in Elimation matches just to run to a area that they hope to throw you off the cliff using the broken mechanic in this game. Then gloat about how of a easy kill you were after you were winning the inital showdown. Alot of characters need to be nerfed including the Shokoji and the Warden (Infinite combo w/ Guard break).

If you want to play against delusional idiots who believe they are good at this game just because they can throw you off a cliff as a last resort move since they can't beat you in a 1v1, then this is the game for you.

They should rename the game to No Honor.",False
good game i do dis for teh badge,True
I can guarantee this is the most ridiculous game you'll ever play,True

"A story of how i got into my first Egirl.

It all began with a match, not on tinder, but a match i joined in this game. She asked me to join her discord so we could talk while playing. At that moment i knew, i had to win the game. Soon i found out something awful, the game lasts an hour, and i wasn't good enough to win so it felt like i would never amount to anything. Soon i got all of my friends together to carry me to MG1. It took many hardships but in the end, we won. Later that night i hopped on the discord with her and showed her my rank. She gasped. She swooned as she saw the rank. I think to myself, wonderful, i've done what i wanted. So i asked her to be my egirl. She said yes. it was this moment i knew it was the start of something beautiful. But, all good things must come to an end. Sooner i found one of my friends playing with her on the discord. They were trying to carry her. They hadn't even invited me and it made me feel sick just to see them. So i decided there was only one thing i could do to redeem myself, beat them at their own game, but i couldn't do it. it was simply too difficult. One sleepless night of playing csgo later, i gave in. I joined the call only to hear they just won. My heart was broken, and she promptly blocked me on all contacts. the only way i could see her anime profile picture after this was from the far range of my steam friends list. After this i broke many a keyboard in anger and i decided i would never be betrayed like this again and i swore that i will become better at this amazing game.

10/10 good game",True
"Be prepared. This game is a labor of love. If you don't enjoy Star Wars, then just pass on this. DO NOT pay full price. You have to install your own fixes to get the game to even work properly. The targeting system is complete and utter garbage, but if you push through it's pretty fun overall. Worth it for a couple of bucks, but I wouldnt pay more than that.",True
"One of my favorite games, I like nothing about it",True
"I just the decision making and the building aspect. Just like ""This War of Mine"". Great game.",True
Great indie game! Really hits a niche spot that i've always wanted! Simple; but effective art style.,True
add a barricade on door and get team killed,True
"this game is actually the best
",True
I was top frag on my team; I had plenty of money to spare. Nobody needed a buy so I bought an auto. Next thing I know I'm kicked from the game. 10/10 Would Recommend,True
"If you like explosions that weren't planned, BIG rOCKETS and punishing little green people the buy this game.

To put it simply KSP is a realistic space simulator which involves you making flight vehicles from  (or rovers). The mechanics work quite well, if you know what you are doing but I wouldn't say it requires a physicist with several degrees to play this game, you should pick up the jist of things quickly. If you are thinking about buying the game I strongly suggest you watch some of 'Scott Manley' on YouTube, he gives good detail and you'll get the idea. 

If you aren't happy with how the game plays or isnt as realisitc as you want it to be 95% of the time there will be a mod for that since the modding community is huge, and if it isn't there, there isn't anything stopping you from making it.

Overall the game holds well and there really isn't much to say about the downsides, I've played the game for 100+ hours and I am yet to find any major bugs, it is very enjoyable and I strongly reccomend it.",True
"Good game....but i gotta admit, i spent the entire game expecting to find Chris and Jill Valentine runnin around somewhere",True
5/5,True
the best,True
Love it,True
"This is the best TF2 has ever been. TF2VR is incredible.

Oh, and the rest of the game's pretty sick too.",True
Probably one of the coolest multiplayer experiences Iv had in a long time! If you're a 80s horror movie fan you owe it to yourself to buy this game.,True
good,True
When playing this game sometimes you need get drunk because this is the only way to forget your desperation status..Sad but true..Get this game without hesitation!!!,True
"Great game but shitty save system. You would have to walk all the way home and sleep in order to save the game. One time my game crashed and I wasted 1 hour of my progress because It didn't save (I let my character faint at night and woke up in bed which now I realised that it doesn't save)... (now I'm going to put myself in other kid's shoe), they should introduce a autosave system where you can log off anytime you want without having to run your ass back home while your parents growing at you to hurry up and get off already.

Update: (bug found)
I died in the cave so I restarted the game in hopes of escaping the 'death punishment' but when I'm back, it magically rewinded 2 hours back on my save file making me lose a very important part of my playthrough which is more progress than the progress lost during death. This is really stupid because it should of restarted back to where I've last slept which means GG NO RE and im not playing this game anymore.

To answer some of your questions:
I really did enjoy the game during my playthrough which is why I'm frustrated because how it betrays me, I've put so much love into it and now somehow my save file 'time travelled' back in time making me lose those progress that were once very important to me. Those moments and nostalgia, every second in fact, that I've been through were lost. Replaying those moments of the game and go through that process again would just break that nostalgia... which is why I'm disappointed.",False
Its alright,True
i thin it was a good game and i wish i didnt just get the trial i might get the full game but i dont know but anyway i would recommend this game,True
Fun to play on coach with kids and friends.,True
